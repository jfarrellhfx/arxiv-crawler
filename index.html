<h3>Eukaryotic swimming cells are shaped by hydrodynamic constraints</h3>

Eukaryotic swimming cells such as spermatozoa, algae or protozoa use flagella
or cilia to move in viscous fluids. The motion of their flexible appendages in
the surrounding fluid induces propulsive forces that balance with the viscous
drag on the cells and lead to a directed swimming motion. Here, we use our
recently built database of cell motility (BOSO-Micro) to investigate the extent
to which the shapes of eukaryotic swimming cells may be optimal from a
hydrodynamic standpoint. We first examine the morphology of flexible flagella
undergoing waving deformation and show that their amplitude-to-wavelength ratio
is near the one predicted theoretically to optimise the propulsive efficiency
of active filaments. Next, we consider ciliates, for which locomotion is
induced by the collective beating of short cilia covering their surface. We
show that the aspect ratio of ciliates are close to the one predicted to
minimise the viscous drag of the cell body. Both results strongly suggest a key
role played by hydrodynamic constraints, in particular viscous drag, in shaping
eukaryotic swimming cells.

Das, Das, and Mandal (PRL 131, 056202, 2023) examine a wavefunction for nu =
5/2 on a sphere including moderate Landau-Level mixing evaluated
perturbatively. The wavefunction they find is not a fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) state as claimed, but rather shows phase separation or bubble/stripe

<h3>Entanglement entropy scaling in critical phases of 1D quasiperiodic  systems</h3>

We study the scaling of the entanglement entropy in different classes of
one-dimensional fermionic quasiperiodic systems with and without pairing,
focusing on multifractal critical points/phases. We find that the entanglement
entropy scales logarithmically with the subsystem size $N_{A}$ with a
proportionality coefficient $\mathcal{C}$, as in homogeneous critical points,
apart from possible additional small oscillations. In the absence of pairing,
we find that the entanglement entropy coefficient $\mathcal{C}$ is
non-universal and depends significantly and non-trivially both on the model
parameters and electron filling, in multifractal critical points. In some of
these points, $\mathcal{C}$ can take values close to the homogeneous (or
ballistic) system, although it typically takes smaller values. We find a close
relation between the behaviour of the entanglement entropy and the small-$q$
(long-wavelength) dependence of the momentum structure factor $\mathcal{S}(q)$.
$\mathcal{S}(q)$ increases linearly with q as in the homogeneous case, with a
slope that grows with $\mathcal{C}$. In the presence of pairing, we find that
even the addition of small anomalous terms affects very significantly the
scaling of the entanglement entropy compared to the unpaired case. In
particular, we focused on topological phase transitions for which the gap
closes with either extended or critical multifractal states. In the former
case, the scaling of the entanglement entropy mirrors the behaviour observed at
the critical points of the homogeneous Kitaev chain, while in the latter, it
shows only slight deviations arising at small length scales. In contrast with
the unpaired case, we always observe $\mathcal{C}\approx1/6$ for different
critical points, the known value for the homogeneous Kitaev chain with periodic
boundary conditions.

<h3>Superdiffusive Transport in Quasi-Particle Dephasing Models</h3>

<br>
<br>
Investigating the behavior of noninteracting fermions subjected to local
dephasing, we reveal that dephasing can induce superdiffusive transport. This
anomaly arises from nodal points within the momentum distribution of local
dephasing quasi-particles, leading to the emergence of asymptotic long-lived
modes. By studying the dynamics of the Wigner function, we rigorously elucidate
how the dynamics of these enduring modes give rise to L\'evy walk processes, a
renowned mechanism underlying superdiffusion phenomena. Our research not only
demonstrates the controllability of dynamical scaling exponents through the
selection of quasi-particles but also extends its applicability to higher
dimensions, underlining the pervasive nature of superdiffusion in dephasing
models.

<h3>Direct Measurement of Mode-resolved Electron-Phonon Coupling with  Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy</h3>

Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is foundational in condensed matter physics,
determining intriguing phenomena and properties in both conventional and
quantum materials. In this manuscript, we propose and demonstrate a novel two
dimensional (2D) EPC spectroscopy which allows for direct extraction of EPC
matrix elements. We find that two pronounced phonon modes of methylammonium
lead iodide (MAPI) at room temperature exhibit highly distinctive EPC
behaviors, both in strength, geometry, and temperature dependence across the
phase transition. This demonstration indicates the potential of our novel 2D
spectroscopy for studying the evolution of mode-resolved EPC at various
external conditions and phonon-mediated light induced ultrafast control of
condensed materials.

<h3>Boundary transfer matrix spectrum of measurement-induced transitions</h3>

Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) are known to be described by
non-unitary conformal field theories (CFTs) whose precise nature remains
unknown. Most physical quantities of interest, such as the entanglement
features of quantum trajectories, are described by boundary observables in this
CFT. We introduce a transfer matrix approach to study the boundary spectrum of
this field theory, and consider a variety of boundary conditions. We apply this
approach numerically to monitored Haar and Clifford circuits, and to the
measurement-only Ising model where the boundary scaling dimensions can be
derived analytically. Our transfer matrix approach provides a systematic
numerical tool to study the spectrum of MIPTs.

<h3>Theoretical prediction of giant Hall high harmonic generation in  monolayer NbSe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03080" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03080</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel A. Rehn, Towfiq Ahmed, Jinkyoung Yoo, Rohit Prasankumar, Jian-Xin Zhu</i>
<br>
<br>
High harmonic generation (HHG) is a powerful probe of electron dynamics on
attosecond to femtosecond timescales and has been successfully used to detect
electronic and structural changes in novel solid-state quantum materials,
including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Among TMDs, bulk NbSe$_2$
exhibits charge density wave (CDW) order below 33 K and becomes superconducting
below 7.3 K. Monolayer NbSe$_2$ is therefore interesting as a material whose
different structural and electronic properties could be probed via HHG. Here,
we predict the HHG response of the pristine 2H and CDW phases of monolayer
NbSe$_2$ using real-time time-dependent density functional theory under the
application of a simulated laser pulse excitation. We find that due to the lack
of inversion symmetry in both monolayer phases, it is possible to excite even
harmonics and that, importantly, the even harmonics appear strictly as the
transverse (Hall) components of the current response under excitations
polarized along the zigzag direction of the monolayer, while odd harmonics
arise from the longitudinal current response in all excitation directions. This
suggests that the even and odd harmonic response can be controlled via the
polarization of the probing field, opening a new avenue for potentially useful
applications in opto-electronic devices.

<h3>Exceeding the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit in flat-band superconductors:  A multiband strong-coupling approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03082" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03082</a>

<br>
<br>
Hybrid systems of superconductors and magnets display several intriguing
properties, both from a fundamental physics point of view and with practical
applications. Promising applications in superconducting spintronics motivate a
search for systems where superconductivity can survive larger inplane critical
magnetic fields than the conventional limit. The Chandrasekhar-Clogston (CC)
limit applies to thin-film conventional superconductors with inplane magnetic
fields such that orbital effects may be ignored. For a magnetic field strength
comparable to the superconducting gap at zero temperature and zero field, a
spin-split normal state attains lower free energy than the superconducting
state. A multiband superconductor with a flat band placed just below the Fermi
surface has been shown to surpass the CC limit using weak-coupling theory.
Since the dimensionless coupling determining the critical temperature scales
with the density of states, it is natural to anticipate corrections from
strong-coupling theory in flat-band systems, owing to the large density of
states of the flat bands. We derive Eliashberg equations and the free energy
for a multiband superconductor in a magnetic field. First, we show that the CC
limit can be exceeded by a small amount in one-band strong-coupling
superconductors due to self-energy renormalization of the magnetic field. Next,
we consider a two-band system with one flat band and find that the CC limit can
be exceeded by a large amount also in strong-coupling theory, even when
including hybridization between bands that intersect.

<h3>Tunneling of fluxons via a Josephson resonant level</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03102</a>
<br>
<i>T. Vakhtel, P. D. Kurilovich, M. Pita-Vidal, A. Bargerbos, V. Fatemi, B. van Heck</i>
<br>
<br>
Fluxons in a superconducting loop can be coherently coupled by quantum phase
slips occurring at a weak link such as a Josephson junction. If Cooper pair
tunneling at the junction occurs through a resonant level, $2\pi$ quantum phase
slips are suppressed, and fluxons are predominantly coupled by $4\pi$ quantum
phase slips. We analyze this scenario by computing the coupling between fluxons
as the level is brought into resonance with the superconducting condensate. The
results indicate that the $4\pi$-dominated regime can be observed directly in
the transition spectrum for circuit parameters typical of a fluxonium qubit. We
also show that, if the inductive energy of the loop is much smaller than the
plasma frequency of the junction, the low-energy Hamiltonian of the circuit is
dual to that of a topological superconducting island. These findings can inform
experiments on bifluxon qubits as well as the design of novel types of
protected qubits.

<h3>Universal Hyperuniformity in Active Field Theories</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03107" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03107</a>
<br>
<i>Yuanjian Zheng, Michael A. Klatt, Hartmut Löwen</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that dry scalar-order active field theories (AFTs) are universally
hyperuniform, i.e., density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in the
long-time limit regardless of the integrability or functional form of the
active contributions up to third order in gradient terms. These AFTs include
Active model B, Active model B+, and effective Cahn-Hilliard models. Moreover,
density variances and spectral densities are virtually indistinguishable from
that of passive phase-separated hyperuniform fields. Higher moments of the
density fluctuations, however, reveal activity-dependent higher-order
correlations that are not captured by conventional two-point measures that
characterize hyperuniformity.

<h3>Optical penetration depth and periodic motion of a photomechanical strip</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03134</a>
<br>
<i>Ameneh Maghsoodi, Kaushik Bhattacharya</i>
<br>
<br>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) containing light-sensitive molecules exhibit
large reversible deformation when subjected to illumination. Here, we
investigate the role of optical penetration depth on this photomechanical
response. We present a model of the photomechanical behavior of photoactive LCE
strips under illumination that goes beyond the common assumption of shallow
penetration. This model reveals how the optical penetration depth and the
consequent photomechanically induced deformation can depend on the
concentration of photoactive molecules, their absorption cross-sections, and
the intensity of illumination. Through a series of examples, we show that the
penetration depth can quantitatively and qualitatively affect the
photomechanical response of a strip. Shallow illumination leads to monotone
curvature change while deep penetration can lead to non-monotone response with
illumination duration. Further, the flapping behavior (a cyclic wave-like
motion) of doubly clamped and buckled strips that has been proposed for
locomotion can reverse direction with sufficiently large penetration depth.
This opens the possibility of creating wireless light-driven photomechanical
actuators and swimmers whose direction of motion can be controlled by light
intensity and frequency.

<h3>Collective depinning and sliding of a quantum Wigner solid in a 2D  electron system</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report the observation of two-threshold voltage-current characteristics
accompanied by a peak of broadband current noise between the two threshold
voltages in the insulating state at low densities in the 2D electron system in
ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. The observed results can be
described by a phenomenological theory of the collective depinning of elastic
structures, which naturally generates a peak of a broadband current noise
between the dynamic and static thresholds and changes to sliding of the solid
over a pinning barrier above the static threshold. This gives compelling
evidence for the electron solid formation in this electron system.

<h3>Metadynamics calculations of the effect of thermal spin fluctuations on  skyrmion stability</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03169" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03169</a>
<br>
<i>Ioannis Charalampidis, Joseph Barker</i>
<br>
<br>
The stability of magnetic skyrmions has been investigated in the past, but
mostly in the absence of thermal fluctuations. However, thermal spin
fluctuations modify the magnetic properties (exchange stiffness,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and anisotropy) that define skyrmion
stability. Thermal magnons also excite internal skrymion dynamics, deforming
the skyrmion shape. Entropy has also been shown to modify skyrmion lifetimes in
experiments, but is absent or approximated in previous studies. Here we use
metadynamics to calculate the free energy surface of a magnetic thin film in
terms of the topological charge and magnetization. We identify the free energy
minima corresponding to different spin textures and the lowest energy paths
between the ferromagnetic and single skyrmion states. We show that at low
temperatures the lowest free energy barrier is a skyrmion collapse process.
However, this energy barrier increases with temperature. An alternative path,
where a singularity forms on the skrymion edge, has a larger free energy
barrier at low temperatures but decreases with increasing temperature and
eventually becomes the lowest energy barrier.

<h3>Critical Role of Disorder for Superconductivity in the Series of  Epitaxial Ti(O,N) Films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Experimental manipulation of superconductivity is of paramount importance,
not only for practical applications but also for identifying the key factors
involved in electron pairing. In this work, we have undertaken a meticulous
study of the superconductivity in a series of titanium compounds with a
rocksalt structure, synthesized as epitaxial films. We find that substituting
nitrogen (N) for oxygen (O) in titanium monoxide (TiO) with the stoichiometry
close to TiO$_{0.6}$N$_{0.4}$ leads to superconductivity with a transition
temperature (T$_c$) of ~2.6 K, about five times higher than that of TiO at ~0.5
K and half as high as the T$_c$ of ~6 K in titanium nitride (TiN). However,
Eliashberg theoretical calculations predict similar Tc in TiO, Ti oxynitride
and TiN. The analysis of electron mean free path suggests the presence of
significant disorder in TiO and a remarkable reduction in the impact of
disorder in oxynitrides. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal
that disorder decreases the coherence of electronic states for non-zero
momenta, which would degrade the influence of electron-phonon. Our findings
demonstrate the disorder and superconductivity depend strongly on the N/O
ratio, highlighting the critical role of disorder for superconductivity in this
series of Ti(O,N) materials.

<h3>Exploring Solute-Defect Interactions in Nanosized Palladium Hydrides  across Multiple Time Scales</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03177</a>
<br>
<i>Xingsheng Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
We employ two different atomistic methods to investigate solute-defect
interactions in nanosized palladium-hydrogen (Pd-H) systems across multiple
time scales. The first method, referred to as Diffusive Molecular Dynamics
(DMD), focuses on capturing hydride phase transformation and the evolution of
solute-induced lattice defects over a diffusive time scale. The second method,
Molecular Dynamics (MD), provides more detailed insights into atomic movements
and lattice relaxation over the time scale of thermal vibrations. These two
methods are connected with MD simulations initialized using statistical
measures of microscopic variables obtained from DMD at different H/Pd ratios.
Our study demonstrates that DMD effectively captures the propagation of an
atomistically sharp hydride phase boundary as well as the dynamics of
solute-induced misfit dislocations and stacking faults. While the
H-concentrated phase leads to a reduction in the vibrational energy, the
presence of stacking faults locally increases the vibrational energy of both Pd
and H atoms. Furthermore, the MD simulation results align with DMD in terms of
equilibrium potential energy, the preservation of hydride phase boundary, and
the spatial distribution of stacking faults. We thoroughly characterize the
lattice crystalline structures in four key regions of the particle. We observe
a preference for H atoms to occupy tetrahedral interstitial sites near stacking
faults due to the lower stacking fault energies provided by these sites within
the H-concentrated phase.

<h3>Efficient network exploration by means of resetting self-avoiding random  walkers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03203" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03203</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The self-avoiding random walk (SARW) is a stochastic process whose state
variable avoids returning to previously visited states. This non-Markovian
feature has turned SARWs a powerful tool for modelling a plethora of relevant
aspects in network science, such as network navigability, robustness and
resilience. We analytically characterize self-avoiding random walkers that
evolve on complex networks and whose memory suffers stochastic resetting, that
is, at each step, with a certain probability, they forget their previous
trajectory and start free diffusion anew. Several out-of-equilibrium properties
are addressed, such as the time-dependent position of the walker, the
time-dependent degree distribution of the non-visited network and the
first-passage time distribution, and its moments, to target nodes. We examine
these metrics for different resetting parameters and network topologies, both
synthetic and empirical, and find a good agreement with simulations in all
cases. We also explore the role of resetting on network exploration and report
a non-monotonic behavior of the cover time: frequent memory resets induce a
global minimum in the cover time, significantly outperforming the well-known
case of the pure random walk, while reset events that are too spaced apart
become detrimental for the network discovery. Our results provide new insights
into the profound interplay between topology and dynamics in complex networks,
and shed light on the fundamental properties of SARWs in nontrivial
environments.

<h3>Planar Hall effect in Weyl semimetals induced by pseudoelectromagnetic  fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03209" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03209</a>
<br>
<i>L. Medel Onofre, A. Martín-Ruiz</i>
<br>
<br>
The planar Hall effect (PHE), the appearance of an in-plane transverse
voltage in the presence of coplanar electric and magnetic fields, has been
ascribed to the chiral anomaly and Berry curvature effects in Weyl semimetals.
In the presence of position- and time-dependent perturbations, such as strain,
Weyl semimetals react as if they would be subjected to emergent electromagnetic
fields, kwnon as pseudo-fields. In this paper we investigate the possibility of
inducing nonlinear phenomena, including the PHE, in strained Weyl semimetals.
Using the chiral kinetic theory in the presence of pseudo-fields, we derive
general expressions for the magnetoconductivity tensor by considering the
simultaneous effects of the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of
carriers, which are indeed of the same order of magnitude. Since pseudo-fields
couple to the Weyl fermions of opposite chirality with opposite signs, we study
chirality-dependent phenomena, including the longitudinal magnetoconductivity
and the planar Hall effect. We discuss our results in terms of the chiral
anomaly with pseudo-fields. These may open new possibilities in
chiralitytronics.

<h3>Simulation method for evaporative cooling of trapped Bose gases at  finite temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03250" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03250</a>
<br>
<i>Emiko Arahata, Tetsuro Nikuni</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a simulation method for evaporative cooling of trapped
Bose-Einstein condensate at finite temperatures using Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin
(ZNG) formalism. ZNG formalism includes the generalized GP equation and a
semiclassical kinetic equation for the thermal cloud, which treats the
excitations semiclassically within the Hartree Fock approximation. The
generalized GP equation includes the mean field due to the thermal cloud and
the source term associated with collisions between the condensate and the
thermal cloud. Our method is based on the numerical approach developed by
Jackson and Zaremba, which simulates the kinetic equation using test particles.
A key point of our method is to mimic the evaporative cooling process by
eliminating the test particles with high energy. We show that our method
successfully describes condensate growth during evaporative cooling. We also
numerically simulate vortex lattice formation during evaporative cooling in the
presence of the rotating thermal cloud.

<br>
<i>Stephanie Striegel, Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, Ehsan Khatami</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent proposals have suggested the use of supervised learning with
convolutional neural networks to shed light on some of the less well known
phases of the Fermi-Hubbard model through the classification of snapshots from
the quantum gas microscopy of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. However,
there have been challenges in the interpretability of networks with more than
one convolutional filter coupled to the input images. Here, we expand on
previous work by considering multiple filters in the first convolutional layer
and developing a process for analyzing the physical relevance of patterns
obtained in the trained filters. We benchmark our approach at half-filling,
where strong antiferromagnetic correlations are known to be present, and we
find that upon hole doping, previously unknown patterns arise at temperatures
below the tunneling amplitude. These patterns may be a signature of interesting
arrangements of fermions in the lattice.

<h3>Peltier effect of phonon driven by ac electromagnetic waves</h3>

<br>
<br>
Steady current in metals induces a thermal gradient, a phenomenon known as
the Peltier effect. The Peltier effect is one of the fundamental phenomena in
the thermoelectric properties of materials and is also used in applications
such as refrigerators. In this work, we show that an analogous phenomenon
occurs by phonons in a material subject to linearly-polarized light. Under
light illumination, an energy current of phonons occurs through a nonlinear
optical effect similar to the bulk photovoltaic effect. We formulate the
nonlinear Peltier coefficient of the photogalvanic energy current carried by
phonons using nonlinear response theory. From the general formula, we show that
the photogalvanic energy current occurs only in a non-centrosymmetric system
with two or more optical phonon bands. We demonstrate the generation of the
photogalvanic energy current using a one-dimensional ion chain with three ions
in a unit cell, which predicts the generation of an experimentally observable
energy current using available THz-infrared light sources.

<br>
<br>
We study the current-phase relation (CPR) of an InSb-Al nanowire Josephson
junction in parallel magnetic fields up to $700$\,mT. At high magnetic fields
and in narrow voltage intervals of a gate under the junction, the CPR exhibits
$\pi$-shifts. The supercurrent declines within these gate intervals and shows
asymmetric gate voltage dependence above and below them. We detect these
features sometimes also at zero magnetic field. The observed CPR properties are
reproduced by a theoretical model of supercurrent transport via interference
between direct transmission and a resonant localized state.

<h3>Efficient Creation of Ultracold Ground State  $^{6}\textrm{Li}^{40}\textrm{K}$ Polar Molecules</h3>

<br>
We report the creation of ultracold ground state
$^{6}\textrm{Li}^{40}\textrm{K}$ polar molecules with high efficiency. Starting
from weakly-bound molecules state, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
is adopted to coherently transfer the molecules to their singlet ro-vibrational
ground state $|\textrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0>$. By employing a singlet
STIRAP pathway and low-phase-noise narrow-linewidth lasers, we observed a
one-way transfer efficiency of 96(4)\,\%. Held in an optical dipole trap, the
lifetime of the ground-state molecules is measured to be 5.0(3)\,ms. The large
permanent dipole moment of LiK is confirmed by applying a DC electric field on
the molecules and performing Stark shift spectroscopy of the ground state. With
recent advances in the quantum control of collisions, our work paves the way
for exploring quantum many-body physics with strongly-interacting
$^{6}\textrm{Li}^{40}\textrm{K}$ molecules.

<br>
<br>
In certain conditions a macroscopic quantum-mechanical scattering may occur,
which may lead to a coherent cross-section on a macroscopic scale in a
monocrystal. The conditions are satisfied by neutrinos, but not satisfied by
other projectiles, with a higher cross-section. This may explain Weber-type
experiments of neutrino detection by a perfect, stiff sapphire monocrystal. The
occurrence of coherence domains for quantum-mechanical scattering and classical
diffraction is analyzed, and the force exerted upon a macroscopic target is
estimated. It is concluded that neutrinos exhibit a distinctive feature in this
respect, due precisely to their very small cross-section.

We consider discrete models of kinetic rough interfaces that exhibit
space-time scale-invariance in height-height correlation. A generic scaling
theory implies that the dynamical structure factor of the height profile can
uniquely characterize the underlying dynamics. We provide a finite-time scaling
that systematically allows an estimation of the critical exponents and the
scaling functions, eventually establishing the universality class accurately.
As an illustration, we investigate a class of self-organized interface models
in random media with extremal dynamics. The isotropic version shows a faceted
pattern and belongs to the same universality class (as shown numerically) as
the Sneppen (model A). We also introduce an anisotropic version of the Sneppen
(model A) and suggest that the model belongs to the universality class of the
tensionless one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.

Ultracold atoms provide a form of analog quantum computer capable of
simulating the quantum turbulence that underlies mysterious phenomena like
pulsar glitches in rapidly spinning neutron stars. Unlike other system (e.g.
liquid helium) ultracold atoms have a viable theoretical framework for
dynamics, but simulations push the edge of current classical computers. We
present the largest simulations of fermionic quantum turbulence to date and
explain the computing technology needed, especially improvements in the
Eigenvalue soLvers for Petaflop Applications (elpa) library that enable us to
diagonalize matrices of record size (millions by millions). We quantify how
dissipation and thermalization proceeds in fermionic quantum turbulence, and
provide evidence that the temperature-dependence of quantum vortices alters the
correlation between the turbulent cascades of flow energy and total vortex
length. All simulation data and source codes are made available to facilitate
rapid scientific progress in the field of quantum turbulence.

<h3>An exactly solvable asymmetric $K$-exclusion process</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We study an interacting particle process on a finite ring with $L$ sites with
at most $K$ particles per site, in which particles hop to nearest neighbors
with rates given in terms of $t$-deformed integers and asymmetry parameter $q$,
where $t>0$ and $q \geq 0$ are parameters. This model, which we call the $(q,
t)$ $K$-ASEP, reduces to the usual ASEP on the ring when $K = 1$ and to a model
studied by Sch\"utz and Sandow (Phys. Rev. E, 1994) when $t = q = 1$. We show
that the steady state does not depend on $q$ and is of product form in terms of
$t$-binomial coefficients, generalizing the same phenomena for the ASEP. We
also give exact formulas for the partition function and show that the steady
state weights are palindromic polynomials in $t$. Interestingly, although the
$(q, t)$ $K$-ASEP does not satisfy particle-hole symmetry in general, the
steady state does. We analyze the density and calculate the most probable
number of particles at a site in the steady state in various regimes of $t$.
Lastly, we construct a two-dimensional exclusion process on a discrete cylinder
with height $K$ and circumference $L$ which projects to the $(q, t)$ $K$-ASEP
and whose steady state distribution is also of product form.
Simulations are attached as ancillary files.

<h3>Boosting the Edelstein effect of two-dimensional electron gases by  ferromagnetic exchange</h3>

<br>
<br>
Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$) two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) have
broken spatial inversion symmetry and possess a finite Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. This enables the interconversion of charge and spin currents through
the direct and inverse Edelstein effects, with record efficiencies at low
temperature, but more modest effects at room temperature. Here, we show that
making these 2DEGs ferromagnetic enhances the conversion efficiency by nearly
one order of magnitude. Starting from the experimental band structure of
non-magnetic SrTiO$_3$ 2DEGs, we mimic magnetic exchange coupling by
introducing an out-of-plane Zeeman term in a tight-binding model. We then
calculate the band structure and spin textures for increasing internal magnetic
fields and compute the Edelstein effect using a semiclassical Boltzmann
approach. We find that the conversion efficiency first increases strongly with
increasing magnetic field, then shows a maximum and finally decreases. This
field dependence is caused by the competition of the exchange coupling with the
effective Rashba interaction. While enhancing the splitting of band pairs
amplifies the Edelstein effect, weakening the in-plane Rashba-type spin texture
reduces it.

<h3>Optimized Finite-Time Work Protocols for the Higgs RNA-Model</h3>

<br>
<i>Peter Werner, Alexander K. Hartmann</i>
<br>
<br>
The Higgs RNA-Model is studied in regard to finite-time driving protocols
with minimal-work requirement. In this paper, RNA sequences which at low
temperature exhibits hairpins are considered, which are often cited as typical
template systems in stochastic thermodynamics. The optimized work protocols for
this glassy many-particle system are determined numerically using the parallel
tempering method. The protocols show distinct jumps at the beginning and end,
which have been observed previously already for single-particle systems.
Counter intuitively, optimality seems to be achieved by staying close to the
equilibrium unfolding transition point. The change of work distributions,
compared to those resulting from a naive linear driving protocol, are discussed
generally and in terms of free energy estimation as well as the effect of
optimized protocols on rare work process starting conditions.

<br>
<br>
We suggest a nanoelectromechanical setup and corresponding time-protocol for
controlling parameters in order to demonstrate nanomechanical manipulation of
superconducting charge-qubit quantum network. We illustrate it on an example
reflecting important task for quantum information processing - transmission of
quantum information between two charge-qubits facilitated by nanomechanics. The
setup is based on terminals utilizing the AC Josephson effect between bias
voltage-controlled bulk superconductors and mechanically vibrating mesoscopic
superconducting grain in the regime of the Cooper pair box, controlled by the
gate voltage. The described manipulation of quantum network is achieved by
transduction of quantum information between charge-qubits and intentionally
built nanomechanical coherent states, which facilitate its transmission between
qubits. This performance is achieved using quantum entanglement between
electrical and mechanical states.

<i>Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Irina V. Vodolazskaya, Andrei V. Eserkepov</i>
<br>
<br>
We studied the effective electrical conductivity of dense random resistor
networks (RRNs) produced using a Voronoi tessellation when its seeds are
generated by means a homogeneous Poisson point process in the two-dimensional
Euclidean space. Such RRNs are isotropic and in average homogeneous, however,
local fluctuations of the number of edges per unit area are inevitably. These
RRNs may mimic, e.g., crack-template-based transparent conductive films. The
RRNs were treated within a mean-field approach (MFA). We found an analytical
dependency of the effective electrical conductivity on the number of conductive
edges (resistors) per unit area, $n_\text{E}$. The effective electrical
conductivity is proportional to $\sqrt{n_\text{E}}$ when $n_\text{E} \gg 1$.

Metal halide perovskites have shown great performance as solar energy
materials, but their outstanding optoelectronic properties are paired with
unusually strong anharmonic effects. It has been proposed that this intriguing
combination of properties derives from the "lone pair" electrons of the
octahedral metal cations, but the precise impact of this chemical feature
remains unclear. Here we show that in fact a lone pair of electrons is not a
prerequisite for the strong anharmonicity and low-energy lattice dynamics
encountered in this class of materials. We combine X-ray diffraction, infrared
and Raman spectroscopies, and first-principles molecular dynamics calculations
to directly contrast the lattice dynamics of CsSrBr$_3$ with those of
CsPbBr$_3$, two compounds which bear close structural similarity but with the
former lacking lone pairs on the octahedral metal. We exploit low-frequency
diffusive Raman scattering, nominally symmetry-forbidden in the cubic phase, as
a fingerprint to detect anharmonicity and reveal that low-frequency tilting
occurs irrespective of lone pair presence. This work highlights the key role of
structure in perovskite lattice dynamics, providing important design rules for
the emerging class of soft perovskite semiconductors for optoelectronic and
light-harvesting devices.

<br>
<br>
We report X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging of nanoscale inclusions of
impurities for quantum technology. A very bright diffraction-limited focus of
the X-ray beam produces very high sensitivity and resolution. We investigated
gallium (Ga) dopants in silicon (Si) produced by a focused ion beam (FIB).
These dopants might provide 3/2-spin qubits or p-type electrical contacts and
quantum dots. We find that the ion beam spot is somewhat larger than expected,
and the technique provides a useful calibration for the resolution of FIBs.
Enticingly, we demonstrate that with a single shot detection of 1 second
integration time, the sensitivity of the XRF would be sufficient to find
amongst background a single isolated inclusion of unknown location comprising
only 3000 Ga impurities (a mass of just 350 zg) without any need for
specialized nm-thickness lamellae, and down from >105 atoms in previous reports
of similar work. With increased integration we were able to detect 650
impurities. The results show that planned facility upgrades might achieve
single atom sensitivity with a generally applicable, non-destructive technique
in the near future.

<br>

We investigated the single-particle Anderson localization problem for
non-Hermitian systems on directed graphs. Various undirected standard random
graph models were modified by controlling reciprocity and hopping asymmetry
parameters. We found the emergence of left, biorthogonal and right localized
states depending on both parameters and graph structure properties such as node
degree $d$. For directed random graphs, the occurrence of biorthogonal
localization near exceptional points is described analytically and numerically.
The clustering of localized states near the center of the spectrum and the
corresponding mobility edge for left and right states are shown numerically.
Structural features responsible for localization, such as topologically
invariant nodes or drain and sources, were also described. Considering the
diagonal disorder, we observed the disappearance of localization dependence on
reciprocity around $W \sim 20$ for a random regular graph $d=4$. With a small
diagonal disorder, the average biorthogonal fractal dimension drastically
reduces. Around $W \sim 5$ localization scars occur within the spectrum,
alternating as vertical bands of clustering of left and right localized states.

<h3>Global density equations for a population of actively switching  particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03418</a>
<br>
<i>Paul C. Bressloff</i>
<br>
<br>
There are many processes in cell biology that can be modeled in terms of an
actively switching particle. The continuous degrees of freedom of the particle
evolve according to a hybrid stochastic differential equation (hSDE) whose
drift term depends on a discrete internal or environmental state that switches
according to a continuous time Markov chain. Examples include Brownian motion
in a randomly switching environment, membrane voltage fluctuations in neurons,
protein synthesis in gene networks, bacterial run-and-tumble motion, and
motor-driven intracellular transport. In this paper we consider the many-body
problem arising from a population of actively switching particles, either
independently switching or subject to a common randomly switching environment.
In the case of a random environment, we show that the global particle density
evolves according to a hybrid stochastic partial differential equation (hSPDE).
We use this to explore how the randomly switching environment induces
statistical correlations between the particles, even in the absence of
particle-particle interactions. We also include the effects of pair-wise
interactions, and indicate how these could be approximated using a hybrid
version of dynamical density functional theory. We then develop the analogous
constructions for independently switching particles, where we now have a
discrete set of global densities that evolve according to a non-hybrid SPDE.
One recent example of such an SPDE arises in a model of a one-component soft
colloidal system in which every particle can stochastically switch between two
interaction states. We end by deriving Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis
(MSRJD) functional path integrals for the density equations in the case of
non-interacting particles, and relate this to recent field theoretic studies of
Brownian gases and run-and-tumble particles (RTPs).

<h3>Noise-Induced Phase Separation and Local Entropy Production Rate in  Scalar Field Theories Driven by Persistent Noise</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Within the Landau-Ginzburg picture of phase transitions, scalar field
theories can undergo phase separation because of a spontaneous
symmetry-breaking mechanism that makes homogeneous field configurations
unstable. This picture works in thermodynamics but also in the dynamics of
phase separation. Here we show that scalar non-equilibrium field theories
undergo phase separation just because of non-equilibrium fluctuations driven by
a persistent noise. The mechanism is similar to what happens in
Motility-Induced Phase Separation where persistent motion introduces an
effective attractive force. In this work, we observe that Noise-Induced Phase
Separation occurs in a region of the phase diagram where disordered field
configurations would otherwise be stable at equilibrium. Moreover, looking at
the local entropy production rate, we find that the breaking of time-reversal
symmetry is concentrated on the boundary between the two phases.

Interstitial topological objects, such as skyrmions, within a natural 1-D
helix are predicted to be free from ambiguous 'skyrmion Hall effect'. The
helical ambience precipitate an additional potential that counteract the Magnus
force arising from the gyrotropic motion of skyrmion. Here, we present the
observation of $\pm$ $\frac{1}{2}$ topological charge objects (anti)merons
within the 1-D helical stripes in D$_{2d}$ symmetric
Mn$_{1.4}$Pt$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$ system. With the help of
Lorentz transmission electron microscopy study we demonstrate that the
pair-wise meron and antimeron chains can be spontaneously stabilized for a
critical In concentration in the system. The exchange frustration induced
proportionate fragmentation of the magnetic moment in the in-plane and
easy-axis directions acts as a basic ingredient for the formation of
(anti)merons within the helical stripe. A constrained drift motion of
(anti)merons along the stripe makes this system an ideal platform for the
realization of skyrmion Hall free track motion. Moreover, the observation of
(anti)merons in addition to the skyrmion and antiskyrmion in D$_{2d}$ materials
makes them a suitable horizon for zoo of topology.

<br>
<br>
Symmetry-breaking phase transitions are central to our understanding of
states of matter. When a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, new
excitations appear that are tied to fluctuations of the order parameter. In
superconductors and fermionic superfluids, the phase and amplitude can
fluctuate independently, giving rise to two distinct collective branches.
However amplitude fluctuations are difficult to both generate and measure, as
they do not couple directly to the density of fermions and have only been
observed indirectly to date. Here, we excite amplitude oscillations in an
atomic Fermi gas with resonant interactions by an interaction quench.
Exploiting the sensitivity of Bragg spectroscopy to the amplitude of the order
parameter, we measure the time-resolved response of the atom cloud, directly
revealing amplitude oscillations at twice the frequency of the gap. The
magnitude of the oscillatory response shows a strong temperature dependence,
and the oscillations appear to decay faster than predicted by time-dependent
BCS theory applied to our experimental setup.

Uranium ions in sesquinitride alpha-U2N3 occupy independent acentric and
centrosymmetric sites according to conventional x-ray diffraction patterns [R.
Tro\'c, J. Solid State Chem. 13, 14 (1975)]. We submit that polar uranium
multipoles in acentric sites are revealed in resonant x-ray diffraction data
recently published by Lawrence Bright et al. [Phys. Rev. B 100, 134426 (2019)].
To this end, their diffraction data gathered with a primary x-ray energy in the
vicinity of the uranium M4 absorption edge are compared to symmetry-informed
diffraction amplitudes calculated for the bixbyite alpha-Mn2O3 lattice
structure. Bragg spots forbidden in this lattice diffraction pattern appear to
provide clear-cut evidence for high-order polar uranium multipoles.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the real-space distribution of the supercurrent that
flows under a uniform vector potential in a two-dimensional quasiperiodic
structure. This is done by considering the attractive Hubbard model on the
quasiperiodic Ammann-Beenker structure and studying the superconducting phase
within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field theory. Decomposing the local
supercurrent into the paramagnetic and diamagnetic components, we numerically
investigate their dependencies on average electron density, temperature, and
the angle of the applied vector potential. We find that the diamagnetic current
locally violates the current conservation law, necessitating compensation from
the paramagnetic current, even at zero temperature. The paramagnetic current
shows exotic behaviors in the quasiperiodic structure, such as local currents
which are oriented transversally or reversely to that of the applied vector
potential.

<h3>Spin-orbit torques and spin Hall magnetoresistance generated by  twin-free and amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1 topological insulator films</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Topological insulators have attracted great interest as generators of
spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in spintronic devices.
Bi\textsubscript{1-x}Sb\textsubscript{x} is a prominent topological insulator
that has a high charge-to-spin conversion efficiency. However, the origin and
magnitude of the SOTs induced by current-injection in
Bi\textsubscript{1-x}Sb\textsubscript{x} remain controversial. Here we report
the investigation of the SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance resulting from
charge-to-spin conversion in twin-free epitaxial layers of
Bi\textsubscript{0.9}Sb\textsubscript{0.1}(0001) coupled to FeCo, and compare
it with that of amorphous Bi\textsubscript{0.9}Sb\textsubscript{0.1}. We find a
large charge-to-spin conversion efficiency of 1 in the first case and less than
0.1 in the second, confirming crystalline
Bi\textsubscript{0.9}Sb\textsubscript{0.1} as a strong spin injector material.
The SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance are independent of the direction of
the electric current, indicating that charge-to-spin conversion in
single-crystal Bi\textsubscript{0.9}Sb\textsubscript{0.1}(0001) is isotropic
despite the strong anisotropy of the topological surface states. Further, we
find that the damping-like SOT has a non-monotonic temperature dependence with
a minimum at 20~K. By correlating the SOT with resistivity and weak
antilocalization measurements, we conclude that charge-spin conversion occurs
via thermally-excited holes from the bulk states above 20~K, and conduction
through the isotropic surface states with increasing spin polarization due to
decreasing electron-electron scattering below 20~K.

<h3>Auxetic polymer networks: The role of crosslinking, density and disorder</h3>

<br>
<br>
Low-connectivity polymer networks were recently found to behave auxetically
when subjected to small tensions, that is, their Poisson's ratio $\nu$ becomes
negative. In addition, for specific state points, numerical simulations
revealed that diamond-like networks reach the limit of mechanical stability,
exhibiting values of $\nu = -1$, a condition that we define hyper-auxeticity.
This behavior is interesting per se for its consequences in material science,
but also appealing for fundamental physics because the mechanical instability
is accompanied by evidences of criticality. In this work, we deepen our
understanding of this phenomenon by performing a large set of equilibrium and
stress-strain simulations in combination with a phenomenological elasticity
theory. The two approaches are found to be in good agreement, confirming the
above results. We also extend our investigations to disordered polymer networks
and find that the hyper-auxetic behavior also holds in this case, still
manifesting a similar critical-like behavior as in the diamond one. Finally, we
highlight the role of the number density, that is found to be a relevant
control parameter determining the elastic properties of the disordered system.
The validity of the results in disordered conditions paves the way to an
experimental investigation of this phenomenon in real systems, such as
hydrogels.

<h3>Elastic Stress Field beneath a Sticking Circular Contact under  Tangential Load</h3>

<i>Emanuel Willert</i>
<br>
<br>
Based on a potential theoretical approach, the subsurface stress field is
calculated for an elastic-half space, which is subject to normal and uniaxial
tangential surface tractions that - in the case of elastic decoupling -
correspond to rigid normal and tangential translations of a circular surface
domain. The stress fields are obtained explicitly and in closed form as the
imaginary parts of compact complex-valued expressions. The stress state in the
surface and on the central axis are considered in detail. As, within specific
approximations that have been discussed at length in the literature, any
tangential contact problem with friction can be understood as a certain
incremental series of such rigid translations, the solutions presented here can
serve as the basis of very fast superposition algorithms for the analysis of
subsurface stress fields in general tangential contact problems with friction.

We theoretically study scanning gate microscopy (SGM) of electron and hole
trajectories in a quantum point contact (QPC) embedded in a
normal-superconductor (NS) junction. At zero voltage bias, the electrons and
holes transported through the QPC create a branched flow and are subject to
self-interference, which marks the SGM conductance maps with interference
fringes analogously as in normal systems. We predict that for an NS junction at
non-zero bias a beating pattern is to occur in the conductance probed with the
use of the SGM technique owing to a mismatch of the Fermi wavevectors of
electrons and holes. Moreover, the SGM technique exposes a pronounced
disturbance in the branched conductance pattern due to wave vector difference,
as the retroreflected hole does not retrace the electron path.

We have prepared a series of (FeSe0.5Te0.5 + xGd) bulk samples, with x = 0,
0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1 and 0.2, through the convenient solid-state reaction
method at ambient pressure (CSP). High gas pressure and high-temperature
synthesis methods (HP-HTS) are also applied to grow the parent compound (x = 0)
and 5-wt% of Gd-added bulks. Structural, microstructural, transport and
magnetic characterizations have been performed on these samples in order to
draw the final conclusion. Our analysis results that the HP-HTS applied for the
parent compound enhances the transition temperature (Tc) and the critical
current density (Jc) with the improved sample density and intergrain
connections. The lattice parameter c is increased with Gd additions, suggesting
a small amount of Gd enters the tetragonal lattice of FeSe0.5Te0.5 and the Gd
interstitial sites are along the c-axis. A systematic decrease of the onset
transition temperature Tc is observed with Gd additions, however, the
calculated Jc of these Gd-added samples is almost the same as that of the
parent compound prepared by CSP. It specifies that there is no improvement of
the grain connections or pinning properties due to these rare earth additions.
However, Gd-added FeSe0.5Te0.5 bulks prepared by HP-HTS have revealed a
slightly improved critical current density due to improved grain connections
and sample density but have a lower transition temperature than that of the
parent compounds.

<br>
<br>
The possibility to engineer a Kitaev chain in quantum dots coupled via
superconductors has recently emerged as a promising path toward topological
superconductivity and possibly nonabelian physics. Here, we show that it is
possible to avoid some of the main experimental hurdles on this path by using
only local proximity effect on each quantum dot in a geometry that resembles a
two-dot version of the proposal in New J. Phys. 15 045020 (2013). There is no
need for narrow superconducting couplers, additional Andreev bound states, or
spatially varying magnetic fields; it suffices with spin-orbit interaction and
a constant magnetic field, in combination with control of the superconducting
phase to tune the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling and an effective
crossed-Andreev-reflection-like process generated by higher-order tunneling. We
use a realistic spinful, interacting model and show that high-quality Majorana
bound states can be generated already in a double quantum dot.

Inverse design aims at the development of elementary building blocks that
organize spontaneously into target shapes. In self-assembly, the blocks diffuse
to their target position. Alternatively, recent experiments point to a more
robust process in which the shape is formed from the self-folding of a planar
template. To control the folding of templates with competing folded structures,
we propose the inclusion of bond specificity. We consider a template that can
fold into an octahedron or a boat shell and find the minimal design capable of
targeting either shell or switching between the two through an external
stimulus, adding a new dimension to the design of shape-changing materials.

The progress in materials science has always been associated with the
development of functional materials systems, which enables us to design
proof-of-concept devices. To advance further, theoretical predictions of new
novel materials and their experimental realization is very important. This
chapter reviews the intriguing properties of rare earth-based materials and
their applications in spintronics. Spintronics is an emerging technology, which
exploits spin degree of freedom of an electron along with its charge property.
Discovery of various physical phenomena and their industrial applications in
the field of magnetic sensors, magnetic recording and non-volatile memories
such as magnetic random access memory (MRAM) and spin-transfer torque (STT)
MRAM opens several new directions in this field. Materials with large spin
polarization, strong spin-orbit coupling, and tunable electronic and magnetic
properties offer an excellent platform for the spintronics technology.
Combination of rare earths with other elements such as transition metals show
broad range of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties which make them
excellent candidates for various spintronic applications. This chapter
discusses many such materials ranging from Heusler alloys, topological
insulators to two-dimensional ferromagnets and their potential applications.
The review gives an insight of how rare-earth materials can play a key role in
emerging future technology and have great potential in many new spintronic
related applications.

The flowing, jamming and avalanche behavior of granular materials is
satisfyingly universal and vexingly hard to tune: a granular flow is typically
intermittent and will irremediably jam if too confined. Here, we show that
granular metamaterials made from particles with a negative Poisson's ratio
yield more easily and flow more smoothly than ordinary granular materials. We
first create a collection of auxetic grains based on a re-entrant mechanism and
show that each grain exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio regardless of the
direction of compression. Interestingly, we find that the elastic and yielding
properties are governed by the high compressibility of granular metamaterials:
at a given confinement they exhibit lower shear modulus, lower yield stress and
more frequent, smaller avalanches than materials made from ordinary grains. We
further demonstrate that granular metamaterials promote flow in more complex
confined geometries, such as intruder and hopper geometries, even when the
packing contains only a fraction of auxetic grains. Our findings blur the
boundary between complex fluids and metamaterials and could help in scenarios
that involve process, transport and reconfiguration of granular materials.

We investigate two different types of non-Markovian coarse-grained models
extracted from a linear, non-equilibrium microscopic system, featuring a tagged
particle coupled to underdamped oscillators. The first model is obtained by
analytically ``integrating out'' the oscillators and the second is derived
using projection operator techniques. We observe that these two models behave
very differently when the tagged particle is exposed to external harmonic
potentials or pulling forces. Most importantly, we find that the analytic model
has a well defined friction kernel and can be used to extract work, consistent
with the microscopic system, while the projection model corresponds to an
effective equilibrium model, which cannot be used to extract work. We apply the
analysis to two popular non-equilibrium systems, time-delay feedback control
and the active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Finally, we highlight that our study
could have important consequences for dynamic coarse-graining of
non-equilibrium systems going far beyond the linear systems investigated in
this manuscript.

Nitrogen represents an archetypal example of material exhibiting a pressure
driven transformation from molecular to polymeric state. Detailed
investigations of such transformations are challenging because of a large
kinetic barrier between molecular and polymeric structures, making the
transformation largely dependent on kinetic stimuli. In the case of nitrogen,
additional complications occur due to the rich polymorphism in the vicinity of
the transition. Here, we report the observation of both molecular (\theta) and
polymeric (BP) phases, crystallized upon temperature quenching of fluid
nitrogen to room temperature at 97-114 GPa. Synchrotron single-crystal X-ray
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations
have been used for diagnostics of the phases and determination of their
structure and stability. Molecular \theta-nitrogen is the most stable among
molecular phases bordering the stability field of polymeric phases, partially
settling a previously noted discrepancy between theory and experiment
concerning the thermodynamic stability limit of molecular phases.

Long-range magnetic textures, such as magnetic skyrmion, give rise to rich
transport properties in magnetic metals, such as the anomalous Hall effect
related to spin chirality, a.k.a. topological Hall effect. In addition to the
topological Hall effect, recent studies on non-centrosymmetric magnets find
that the spin-orbit interaction of itinerant electrons gives rise to novel
contributions related to spin chirality, i.e., the chiral Hall effect. In this
work, we discuss that the spin-orbit interaction has a distinct, yet
significant, effect on the anomalous Hall effect related to spin chirality in
centrosymmetric magnets. Using a scattering theory method, we find that the
anomalous Hall effect related to scalar spin chirality in a two-dimensional
Luttinger model is suppressed by more than one order of magnitude compared to
the quadratic dispersion, and the contributions similar to the chiral Hall
effect in Rashba model vanishes. At the same time, a novel term that gives
different Hall conductivity for the Bloch and Neel skyrmions occurs, thereby
enabling the detection of the skyrmion helicity. The striking differences
demonstrate the rich effect of crystal symmetry on the chirality-related
anomalous Hall effect in materials with strong spin-orbit interaction.

<h3>Unconventional superconductivity in Sc$_2$Ir$_{4-x}$Si$_x$ by spin-orbit  coupling driven flat band</h3>

The kagome lattice is very attractive as it can host many novel quantum
states, such as the charge density wave, superconductivity, quantum spin
liquid, etc. Meanwhile, iridates often exhibit a strong spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) effect due to the large atomic mass of 5$d$ elements, which has important
implications for both the energy bands and the pairing symmetry of
superconductors. For the Laves phase superconductor Sc$_2$Ir$_4$ with a kagome
lattice, by doping Si to the Ir sites, we observed a nonmonotonic and two-dome
like doping dependence of the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm
c}$, which is typically found in many unconventional superconducting systems.
Interestingly, for some samples, especially Sc$_2$Ir$_{3.5}$Si$_{0.5}$ with the
optimal $T_{\rm c}$, after the suppression of superconductivity, the
normal-state resistivity exhibits a semiconducting behavior; meanwhile, the
specific heat coefficient shows an upturn which follows the relation
$C/T\propto{\rm ln}(T_0/T)$ at low temperatures. Around the optimal doping, the
resistance measurements exhibit strong superconducting fluctuations. And the
superconductivity related specific heat can be fitted by the model of a
$d$-wave gap after subtracting the normal-state background. These strongly
suggest unconventional superconductivity and correlation effect in the samples,
which is mainly induced by a flat band near the Fermi level when considering
the SOC, as supported by the first-principles calculations. Our results reveal
a new unconventional superconducting system Sc$_2$Ir$_{4-x}$Si$_x$ with strong
correlation effects induced by the flat band in the kagome system with strong
SOC.

High-performance graphical processing units (GPU) are used for the repeated
parallelised propagation of non-linear partial differential equations on large
spatio-temporal grids. The main challenge results as a combination of the
requirement of large grids for exploring scaling over several orders of
magnitude, both in space and time, and the need for high statistics in
averaging over many runs, in computing correlation functions for highly
fluctuating quantum many-body states. With our simulations, we explore the
dynamics of complex quantum systems far from equilibrium, with the aim of
classifying their universal characteristics such as scaling exponents near
non-thermal fixed points. Our results are strongly relevant for the development
of synthetic quantum systems when exploring the respective physics in the
laboratory.

<h3>Huge Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in Re_Co_Pt thin films</h3>

We investigate the magnetization and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
(DMI) in Pt/Co/Re thin films in the case of perfect interfaces and upon the
introduction of intermixing on both Co interfaces. Calculations were
implemented on a series of systems with a varied number of cobalt atomic layers
(ALs). Remarkably, the Re is able to introduce a DMI at the interface with
cobalt and also, increase the DMI at the Pt/Co interface. We demonstrate that
the chiral magnetic multilayer Pt/Co/Re with chiral spin structure can achieve
a huge DMI value which is almost double of that attained in the prototype
system W/Co/Pt. We study also the DMI as a function of the Re thickness finding
the optimal thickness to maximize the DMI. When we include a disorder that
cancels a contribution from all first-neighbor Co atoms in the intermixed
region, we found out that intermixing at the two interfaces affects the
strength of the DMI solely when introduced at the Pt/Co interface where the DMI
loses almost half of its value. On the contrary, the mixing at the Co/Re
interface has very little or no effect as compared to the case with perfect
interfaces. The value of the DMI would be somewhere between the perfect
interface case and the totally intermixed case. The realization of such a
device should focus on the reduction of the Pt/Co intermixing to realize this
huge DMI interaction.

We investigate the quasi-particle and transport properties of a model
describing interacting Dirac and Weyl semimetals in the presence of local
Hubbard repulsion $U$, where we explicitly include a deviation from the
linearity of the energy-momentum dispersion through an intermediate-energy
scale $\Lambda$. Our focus lies on the correlated phase of the semimetal. At
the nodal point, the renormalization of spectral weight at a fixed temperature
$T$ exhibits a weak dependence on $\Lambda$ but is sensitive to the proximity
to the Mott transition. Conversely, the scattering rate of quasi-particles and
the resistivity display high-temperature exponents that crucially rely on
$\Lambda$, leading to a crossover towards a conventional Fermi-liquid behaviour
at finite T. Finally, by employing the Nernst-Einstein relation for
conductivity, we identify a corresponding density crossover as a function of
the chemical potential.

<h3>Prediction of depinning transitions in interface models using Gini and  Kolkata indices</h3>

The dynamics of driven interfaces through disordered media is a common
framework for a myriad of diverse systems starting from mode-I fracture, vortex
lines in superconductors, magnetic domain walls to invading fluid in a porous
medium to name a few. The dynamics, for a slow enough drive, progress through
punctuated equilibria, showing an intermittent, scale free response statistics
that are characterized by only a few parameters. For a strong enough driving,
on the other hand, the interface is depinnind i.e., can move continuously
through the embedded medium. This depinning transition, often characterized as
a critical phenomenon, is a crucial point for the system in question, since it
often represent a drastic change in the system (catastrophic failure in the
case of fracture, magnetisation switching in the case of domain walls,
breakthrough point in the case of fluid invasion etc.). In this work, we
outline a framework that can give a precursory signal of the imminent depinning
transition by monitoring the variations in sizes or the inequality of the
intermittent responses of a system seen prior to the depinning point. In
particular, we use measures traditionally used to quantify economic inequality,
the Gini index and the Kolkata index, for the case of the unequal responses of
pre-critical systems. The crossing point of these two indices serves as a
precursor to imminent depinning. Given a scale free size distributions of the
responses, we calculate the expressions for these indices, evaluate their
crossing points and give a recipe for forecasting depinning transitions. We
compare these with simulation results from the Edwards-Wilkindon, KPZ and fiber
bundle model interface with variable interaction strength. The results are
applicable for any interface dynamics undergoing depinning transition.

<h3>Quaternary borocarbides: a testbed for DFT for superconductors</h3>

Using ab-initio density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), we
systematically study the quaternary borocarbides $RM_2$B$_2$C. Treating the
retarded (frequency-dependent) interaction $W(\omega)$ within the random-phase
approximation (RPA), we find good agreement with experiments for the calculated
superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ in the nonmagnetic Ni- and Pd-based
compounds. We argue that the problem of accurately placing the $f$-bands within
DFT, and possibly the lack of an explicit magnetic pair-breaking mechanism,
explain the difficulties of SCDFT in reproducing $T_c$ in members of the
magnetic $R$Ni$_2$B$_2$C series ($R$ rare-earth with partially filled $4f$).
While the calculated $T_c$ is overestimated, SCDFT qualitatively captures the
experimentally observed trend along the rare-earth series, which indicates that
the electron-phonon couplings and dynamically screened interactions have a
significant effect on $T_c$.

<h3>Characterizing and Mitigating Timing Noise-Induced Decoherence in Single  Electron Sources</h3>

Identifying and controlling decoherence in single electron sources (SES) is
important for their applications in electron quantum optics and quantum
information processing. Here we address a rather generic source of decoherence
inherent to SES generating pico-second wave packets as in a recent experiment
[J. D. Fletcher et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 5298 (2019)], namely, decoherence
caused by timing noise in the source. Regardless of the specific microscopic
mechanism, the source with timing noise generates an ensemble of temporally
shifted wave packet instead of a single wave packet, and the density matrix in
energy basis becomes squeezed along the diagonal. This distinctive feature
allows us to propose a protocol to identify and characterize SES with timing
noise. Using this protocol, we demonstrate that the purity of states decohered
by timing noise can be readily enhanced by using an energy filtering via
potential barriers.

<h3>Role of plasticity in the universal scaling of shear thickening dense  suspensions</h3>

Increase in viscosity under increasing shear stress, known as shear
thickening (ST), is one of the most striking properties of dense particulate
suspensions. Under appropriate conditions, they exhibit discontinuous shear
thickening (DST), where the viscosity increases dramatically and can also
transform into a solid-like state due to shear induced jamming (SJ). The
microscopic mechanism giving rise to such interesting phenomena is still a
topic of intense research. A phenomenological model proposed by Wyart and Cates
shows that the proliferation of stress-activated interparticle frictional
contacts can give rise to such striking flow properties. Building on this
model, a recent work proposes and verifies a universal scaling relation for ST
systems where two different power-law regimes with a well-defined crossover
point is obtained. Nonetheless, the difference in the nature of the flow in
these two scaling regimes remains unexplored. Here, using rheology in
conjugation with high-speed optical imaging, we study the flow and local
deformations in various ST systems. We observe that with increasing applied
stress, the smooth flow changes into a spatio-temporally varying flow across
the scaling-crossover. We show that such fluctuating flow is associated with
intermittent dilatancy, shear band plasticity and fracture induced by system
spanning frictional contacts.

<h3>Topological Density Correlations in a Fermi Gas</h3>

A Fermi gas of non-interacting electrons, or ultra-cold fermionic atoms, has
a quantum ground state defined by a region of occupancy in momentum space known
as the Fermi sea. The Euler characteristic $\chi_F$ of the Fermi sea serves to
topologically classify these gapless fermionic states. The topology of a $D$
dimensional Fermi sea is physically encoded in the $D+1$ point equal time
density correlation function. In this work, we first present a simple proof of
this fact by showing that the evaluation of the correlation function can be
formulated in terms of a triangulation of the Fermi sea with a collection of
points, links and triangles and their higher dimensional analogs. We then make
use of the topological $D+1$ point density correlation to reveal universal
structures of the more general $M$ point density correlation functions in a $D$
dimensional Fermi gas. Two experimental methods are proposed for observing
these correlations in $D=2$. In cold atomic gases imaged by quantum gas
microscopy, our analysis supports the feasibility of measuring the third order
density correlation, from which $\chi_F$ can be reliably extracted in systems
with as few as around 100 atoms. For solid-state electron gases, we propose
measuring correlations in the speckle pattern of intensity fluctuations in
nonlinear X-ray scattering experiments.
