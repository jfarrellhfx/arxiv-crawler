<h3>Charge-pseudospin coupled diffusion in semi-Dirac graphene: pseudospin assisted valley transport</h3>

Modifying the hexagonal lattices of graphene enables the repositioning and
merging of the Dirac cones which proves to be a key element in the use of these
materials for alternative electronic applications such as valleytronics. Here
we study the nonequilibrium transport of carriers within a system containing
two Dirac cones in both standard graphene and semi-Dirac graphene. In the
latter, the lattice modifications cause the relativistic and parabolic
dispersion bands to coexist, furnishing the Fermi surface with a rich
pseudospin texture and a versatile Dirac cones separation. We construct a
kinetic theory to investigate the carrier diffusion and uncover that the
pseudospin index contributes to the particle current and, like the real spin,
can induce a magnetoelectric effect, and argue that the pseudospin-charge
coupling can be utilized to design a pseudospin filter. We explore the charge
dynamics inside a quasi-one-dimensional conductor using the drift-diffusion
model and detect the pseudospin accumulation at the sample boundaries. We find
that, while, for graphene, the accumulation contributes to an extra voltage
drop between the sample interfaces, the semi-Dirac system presents a similar
accumulation that is strikingly equipped with valley polarization, signifying
an essential tool for the control of valley manipulation and chirality
transport using the pseudospin.

<h3>Possible zero sound in layered perovskites with ferromagnetic $s$-$d$ exchange interaction</h3>

We analyze the conditions for observation of zero sound in layered
perovskites with transition metal ion on chalcogenide oxidizer. We conclude
that propagation of zero sound is possible only for anti-ferromagnetic sign of
the $s$-$d$ interaction. If the $s$-$d$ exchange integral $J_{sd}$ has
antiferromagnetic sign, as it is perhaps in the case for layered cuprates, zero
sound is a thermally activated dissipation mode,which generates only "hot
spots" in the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) data along the
Fermi contour. We predict that zero sound will be observable for transition
metal perovskites with 4$s$ and 3$d$ levels close to the $p$-level of the
chalcogenide. The simultaneous lack of superconductivity, the appearance of hot
spots in ARPES data, and the proximity of the three named levels, represents
the significant hint for the choice of material to be investigated.

<h3>Trapping of active Brownian and run-and-tumble particles: a first-passage time approach</h3>

We use a first-passage time approach to study the statistics of the trapping
times induced by persistent motion of active particles colliding with flat
boundaries. The angular first-passage time distribution and mean first-passage
time is calculated exactly for active Brownian and run-and-tumble particles and
the results are compared. Theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement
with Langevin simulations. Our results shed further light onto how active
particles with different dynamics may be equivalent in the bulk, yet behave
differently near boundaries or obstacles.

<h3>Field-theoretic functional renormalization group formalism for non-Fermi liquids and its application to the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00730v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00730v1</a>

To capture the universal low-energy physics of metals within effective field
theories, one has to generalize the usual notion of scale invariance and
renormalizable field theory due to the presence of intrinsic scales (Fermi
momenta). In this paper, we develop a field-theoretic functional
renormalization group formalism for full low-energy effective field theories of
non-Fermi liquids that include all gapless modes around the Fermi surface. The
formalism is applied to the non-Fermi liquid that arises at the
antiferromagnetic quantum critical point in two space dimensions. In the space
of coupling functions, an interacting fixed point arises at a point with
momentum-independent couplings and vanishing nesting angle. In theories
deformed with non-zero nesting angles, coupling functions acquire universal
momentum profiles controlled by the bare nesting angles at low energies before
flowing to superconducting states in the low-energy limit. The superconducting
instability is unavoidable because lukewarm electrons that are coherent enough
to be susceptible to pairing end up being subject to a renormalized attractive
interaction with its minimum strength set by the nesting angle. Despite the
inevitable superconducting instability, theories with small bare nesting angles
and bare four-fermion couplings that are repulsive or weakly attractive must
pass through the region with slow RG flow due to the proximity to the non-Fermi
liquid fixed point. The bottleneck region controls the scaling behaviours of
the normal state and the quasi-universal pathway from the non-Fermi liquid to
superconductivity. In the limit that the nesting angle is small, the non-Fermi
liquid scaling dictates the physics over a large window of energy scale above
the superconducting transition temperature.
