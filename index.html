<p>The hydrodynamics of thin films is typically described using phenomenological
models whose connection to the microscopic particle dynamics is a subject of
ongoing research. Existing methods based on density functional theory provide a
good description of static thin films, but are not sufficient for understanding
nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic derivation of
the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism.
This method allows to directly obtain the correct gradient dynamics structure
along with microscopic expressions for the mobility and the free energy. Our
results are verified against molecular dynamics simulations for both simple

<h3>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the  cutoff</h3>

</p><i>Garry Goldstein</i>
<p>In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study momentum
space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms ofthe cutoff. We show
that already at order 4-d where d is the dimension of the phi^{4} theory there
are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant
coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor phi^{4} model that
symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed by the different flavors
having different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric
fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in
parquet RG (pRG).

<h3>Deformation of power law in the double Pareto distribution using  uniformly distributed observation time</h3>

<p>The double Pareto distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution with a
power-law tail, that is generated via geometric Brownian motion with an
exponentially distributed observation time. In this study, we examine a
modified model wherein the exponential distribution of the observation time is
replaced with a continuous uniform distribution. The probability density,
complementary cumulative distribution, and moments of this model are exactly
calculated. Furthermore, the validity of the analytical calculations is
discussed in comparison with numerical simulations of stochastic processes.

<h3>Fluctuations of thermal variables investigated by cross-correlation  function</h3>

</p><i>Jean-Luc Garden</i>
<p>Fluctuations in conjugate thermodynamic variables are studied using the
cross-correlation function. A new procedure is given enabling the derivation of
fluctuation formulas for a system in equilibrium. Specifically, the
cross-correlation function between heat and temperature is employed for thermal
variables. Additionally, fluctuation-dissipation relations involving the
frequency-dependent specific heat are established. Moreover, a general relation
concerning the average entropy production is also given, which is the
microscopic analogue of the dissipation formula of the linear response theory.
In the case of thermal variables, this formula finds application in various
scenarios describing fluctuating thermal systems in equilibrium.

<h3>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or  perturbation approximation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yunlin Li, Jingguang Chen, Xingchao Qi, Langlang Xiong, Xianjun Wang, Yufu Liu, Fang Guan, Lei Shi, Xunya Jiang</i>
<p>The systems without symmetries, e.g. the internal or spatial symmetry, are
generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional
integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with
multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, we show that the
topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and a new
integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding
number, can properly characterise the topology of such systems. For the first
method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and
its chiral counterpart is constructed, which accounts for the topology
reconstruction at half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space
of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by
perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the
topology reconstruction at fractional-filling gaps. The perturbation-based
topology exhibits extraordinary robustness since it even exists beyond the weak
perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other
asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the
superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we
predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory
and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agree with each other
very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena
in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which
should greatly expand the category of topology study.

<h3>Characterizing the Entanglement of Anyonic Systems using the Anyonic  Partial Transpose</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12121</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nico Kirchner, Wonjune Choi, Frank Pollmann</i>
<p>Entanglement of mixed quantum states can be quantified using the partial
transpose and its corresponding entanglement measure, the logarithmic
negativity. Recently, the notion of partial transpose has been extended to
systems of anyons, which are exotic quasiparticles whose exchange statistics go
beyond the bosonic and fermionic case. Studying the fundamental properties of
this anyonic partial transpose, we first reveal that when applied to the
special case of fermionic systems, it can be reduced to the fermionic partial
transpose or its twisted variant depending on whether or not a boundary
Majorana fermion is present. Focusing on ground state properties, we find that
the anyonic partial transpose captures both the correct entanglement scaling
for gapless systems, as predicted by conformal field theory, and the phase
transition between a topologically trivial and a nontrivial phase. For
non-abelian anyons and the bipartition geometry, we find a rich multiplet
structure in the eigenvalues of the partial transpose, the so-called negativity
spectrum, and reveal the possibility of defining both a charge- and an
imbalance-resolved negativity.

<h3>Non-Abelian and Abelian descendants of vortex spin liquid: fractional  quantum spin Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12126</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ya-Hui Zhang</i>
<p>The recent experimental observation of a potential fractional quantum spin
Hall (FQSH) state in the twisted MoTe$_2$ system has sparked theoretical
explorations at total filling $\nu_T=1$ of a pair of $C=\pm 1$ Chern bands from
the two spins (locked to valley). One intriguing candidate is a vortex spin
liquid (VSL), which can be viewed as an exciton version of composite fermi
liquid (CFL). The VSL insulator is incompressible in the charge channel, while
compressible in the spin channel. Here we investigate fully gapped descendants
of the VSL phase at the total filling
$\nu_T=\nu_{\uparrow}+\nu_{\downarrow}=1$. At zero magnetization, a non-Abelian
state with both FQSH and thermal Hall effect emerges from weak $p+ip$ pairing
of the neutral Fermi surface, hosting 12 anyons (up to addition of physical
electron) including two independent Ising anyons separately carrying charge and
spin. Strong pairing leads to a Z$_4$ topological order with only FQSH effect.
At non-zero magnetization $m=2S_z$, there is a Jain sequence of magnetic
plateaus with $m=\frac{1}{p}, p \in Z$, exhibiting both half FQSH effect and
spin fractional quantum Hall effect (SFQH). Our work highlights the VSL's
potential as a parent state to organize numerous FQSH insulators with
non-trivial inter-valley correlations at $\nu_T=1$. The quantized FQSH behavior
remains robust even in the presence of ferromagnetism, thanks to the
spin-charge separation nature inherent in the parent VSL phase. Future
experimental investigations are crucial to validate or rule out spontaneous
magnetization and time reversal symmetry breaking.

<h3>A modified interferometer to measure anyonic braiding statistics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Steven A. Kivelson, Chaitanya Murthy</i>
<p>Existing quantum Hall interferometers measure twice the braiding phase,
$e^{i2\theta}$, of Abelian anyons, i.e. the phase accrued when one
quasi-particle encircles another clockwise. We propose a modified
Fabry-P\'{e}rot or Mach-Zehnder interferometer that can measure $e^{i\theta}$.

<h3>Fractionalization Signatures in the Dynamics of Quantum Spin Liquids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12141</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kang Wang, Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Runze Chi, Hai-Jun Liao, Tao Xiang</i>
<p>We investigate the signatures of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids by
studying different phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model in the presence of an
out-of-plane magnetic field through which the model becomes non-integrable.
Using the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) ansatz, along with
analytical calculations and exact diagonalization, we calculate dynamical
signatures of fractionalized particles through spin-spin and dimer-dimer
correlations. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of these correlations to
discern distinct fractionalized quantum sectors, namely Majorana fermions and
the emergent $Z_2$ fluxes, in both the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase under
weak field and the emergent intermediate gapless phase (IGP) under moderate
field. Importantly, our calculation reveals the nature of IGP observed at
moderate fields, a region of ongoing debate, indicating that this phase is a
Majorana metal induced by strong flux fluctuations.

<h3>One-shot pair distribution functions of thin films using lab-based x-ray  sources</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12163</a>
<br>
</p><i>Johan Bylin, Vassilios Kapaklis, Gunnar K. Pálsson</i>
<p>We demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining accurate pair distribution
functions of thin amorphous films down to 80 nm, using modern laboratory-based
x-ray sources. The pair distribution functions are obtained using a single
diffraction scan (one-shot) without the requirement of additional scans of the
substrate or of the air. By using a crystalline substrate combined with an
oblique scattering geometry, most of the Bragg scattering of the substrate is
avoided, rendering the substrate Compton scattering the primary contribution.
By utilizing a discriminating energy filter, available in the latest generation
of modern detectors, we demonstrate that the Compton intensity can further be
reduced to negligible levels at higher wavevector values. We minimize
scattering from the sample holder and the air by the systematic selection of
pixels in the detector image based on the projected detection footprint of the
sample and the use of a 3D printed sample holder. Finally, x-ray optical
effects in the absorption factors and the ratios between the Compton intensity
of the substrate and film are taken into account by using a theoretical tool
that simulates the electric field inside the film and the substrate, which aids
in planning both the sample design and measurement protocol.

<h3>Exploring Conformational Landscapes Along Anharmonic Low-Frequency  Vibrations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12174" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12174</a>
<br>
</p><i>Michael A. Sauer, Souvik Mondal, Matthias Heyden</i>
<p>We aim to automatize the identification of collective variables to simplify
and speed up enhanced sampling simulations of conformational dynamics in
biomolecules. We focus on anharmonic low-frequency vibrations that exhibit
fluctuations on timescales faster than conformational transitions but describe
a path of least resistance towards structural change. A key challenge is that
harmonic approximations are ill-suited to characterize these vibrations, which
are observed at far-infrared frequencies and are easily excited by thermal
collisions at room temperature.
Here, we approached this problem with a frequency-selective anharmonic
(FRESEAN) mode analysis that does not rely on harmonic approximations and
successfully isolates anharmonic low-frequency vibrations from short molecular
dynamics simulation trajectories. We applied FRESEAN mode analysis to
simulations of alanine dipeptide, a common test system for enhanced sampling
simulation protocols, and compare the performance of isolated low-frequency
vibrations to conventional user-defined collective variables (here backbone
dihedral angles) in enhanced sampling simulations.
The comparison shows that enhanced sampling along anharmonic low-frequency
vibrations not only reproduces known conformational dynamics but can even
further improve sampling of slow transitions compared to user-defined
collective variables. Notably, free energy surfaces spanned by low-frequency
anharmonic vibrational modes exhibit lower barriers associated with
conformational transitions relative to representations in backbone dihedral
space. We thus conclude that anharmonic low-frequency vibrations provide a
promising path for highly effective and fully automated enhanced sampling
simulations of conformational dynamics in biomolecules.

<h3>Size-dependent ferroelectric-to-paraelectric sliding transformations and  antipolar-to-ferroelectric topological phase transitions in binary  homobilayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12175" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12175</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pacheco-Sanjuan Alejandro, Kumar Pradeep, Barraza-Lopez Salvador</i>
<p>The recent discovery of ferroelectric behavior in few-layer materials,
accompanied by the observation of antipolar domains in hexagonal boron nitride
and transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e bilayers, is paving the way for
revolutionary advancements in the generation and manipulation of intrinsic
electric dipoles through stacking. In addition, these cutting-edge quantum
materials are reshaping our comprehension of phase transitions. Within the
present study, we unveil a hitherto unreported size-dependent sliding behavior
that marks a significant departure from conventional ferroelectrics. We also
shed light on thermally induced spontaneous hyperlubric sliding within moir\'e
bilayers, which can be used as a signal to distinguish topological phase
transitions from an antipolar onto a ferroelectric bilayer. Our findings also
suggest that the (topological) pinning of AA nodes in antipolar moir\'e
homobilayers prevents the occurrence of an antipolar-to-paraelectric
transformation.

<h3>Halperin States of Particles and Holes in Ideal Time Reversal Invariant  Pairs of Chern Bands and The Fractional Quantum Spin Hall Effect in Moiré  MoTe$_2$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12185" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12185</a>
<br>
</p><i>Inti Sodemann Villadiego</i>
<p>An experiment in moir\'e MoTe$_2$ bilayers reported the first observation of
a topologically ordered state with zero Hall conductivity and half of the edge
conductance of a standard time-reversal invariant quantum spin Hall insulator.
This state is believed to emerge at total filling one of a pair of bands with
Chern numbers $C=\pm1$ related by time reversal symmetry. By viewing these
bands as a pair of Landau levels with opposite magnetic fields, and starting
from a parent magnet with one filled band, we demonstrate that a class of
Halperin states constructed by adding particles to the empty Chern band and
holes to the occupied Chern band have all the properties observed in MoTe$_2$.
Remarkably, these states break time-reversal symmetry but have exactly zero
Hall conductivity and helical edge conductance of $e^2/2h$. These states also
feature a spinless composite fermion with the same charge as the electron but
split equally between both valleys. In a standard Halperin 331 state, this
particle would be a neutral Bogoliubov composite fermion. However, in our
context this composite fermion is charged but remains itinerant because it is
split into the two valleys that effectively experience opposite magnetic
fields. The existence of such charged itinerant particles is a key difference
between Landau levels with opposite magnetic fields and standard
multi-components Landau levels, where all the itinerant particles are charge
neutral, such as the magneto-roton of the Laughlin state or the Bogoliubov
composite fermion of the Moore-Read state. When the electron density changes
away from the ideal filling and these itinerant charged particles are added to
the parent state, the disorder potential is less efficient at localizing them
as compared to standard Lanadau levels. This can explain why the state in
MoTe$_2$ did not display a robust Hall plateau upon changing the electron
density.

<h3>The transition and coexistence of quantum droplets and solitons in  quasi-1D dipolar Bose gas</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12209" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12209</a>
<br>
</p><i>Y. Y. Shi</i>
<p>In our study, we investigated bright solitons, dark solitons, and quantum
droplets in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose gases, and further validated the
crossover and coexistence of quantum droplets and solitons using the
Lieb-Liniger energy within the framework of local density approximation.
Increasing the particle number N transforms the bright dipolar soliton state
into a stable self-bound quantum droplet state, with further increases in N
leading to a broader quantum droplet that enables the presence of dark solitons
within it.

<h3>Intervalence Plasmons in Boron-Doped Diamond</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12221" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12221</a>
<br>
</p><i>Souvik Bhattacharya, Jonathan Boyd, Sven Reichardt, Amir Hossein Talebi, Nicolò Maccaferri, Olga Shenderova, Ludger Wirtz, Giuseppe Strangi, R. Mohan Sankaran</i>
<p>Doped semiconductors are capable of exhibiting metallic-like properties
ranging from superconductivity to tunable localized surface plasmon resonances.
Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active
by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the
electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge
carriers and plasmons, which could facilitate optical applications, has never
been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond,
defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands,
opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low energy excitations
is provided by scanning transmission electron microscope-valence electron
energy loss spectroscopy and photoinduced force infrared spectroscopy. The
measured loss and absorbance spectra are subsequently reproduced by
first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band
transitions to the dielectric function. Remarkably, the calculations also
reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a resonance
characteristic of metallicity (narrow-banded negative values of the dielectric
function). The energy of the zero-crossing and the position of the loss peak
are found to coincide, and both increase with the carrier density. Our results
provide insight into a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in
doped semiconductors from intervalence band transitions, and the possibility of
attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for biomedical
and quantum information technologies.

<h3>High-throughput measurement of elastic moduli of microfibers by rope  coiling</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12225" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12225</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yuan Liu, Jack Hau Yung Lo, Janine K. Nunes, Howard A. Stone, Ho Cheung Shum</i>
<p>There are many fields where it is of interest to measure the elastic moduli
of tiny fragile fibers, such as filamentous bacteria, actin filaments, DNA,
carbon nanotubes, and functional microfibers. The elastic modulus is typically
deduced from a sophisticated tensile test under a microscope, but the
throughput is low and limited by the time-consuming and skill-intensive sample
loading/unloading. Here, we demonstrate a simple microfluidic method enabling
the high-throughput measurement of the elastic moduli of microfibers by rope
coiling using a localized compression, where sample loading/unloading are not
needed between consecutive measurements. The rope coiling phenomenon occurs
spontaneously when a microfiber flows from a small channel into a wide channel.
The elastic modulus is determined by measuring either the buckling length or
the coiling radius. The throughput of this method, currently 3,300 fibers per
hour, is a thousand times higher than that of a tensile tester. We demonstrate
the feasibility of the method by testing a nonuniform fiber with axially
varying elastic modulus. We also demonstrate its capability for in situ inline
measurement in a microfluidic production line. We envisage that high-throughput
measurements may facilitate potential applications such as screening or sorting
by mechanical properties and real-time control during production of
microfibers.

<h3>Shape and size measurements of nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates  using image processing</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12238" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12238</a>
<br>
</p><i>J.P.G. Venassi, V.S. Bagnato, G.D. Telles</i>
<p>Bose-Einstein condensates have been the subject of intense research in recent
years due to their potential applications in quantum computing and many other
areas. However, measuring the shape and size of out-of-equilibrium
Bose-Einstein condensates is a challenging task that requires sophisticated
image processing techniques. We propose to study perturbed BEC based on general
concepts of analysis, which are widely used in the image processing community.
The mathematical basis underlying the algorithms is quite general and
independent of the type of image studied. The morphological changes observed in
the perturbed atomic clouds as a result of excitation amplitude were observed
in a consistent manner. And the spatial expansion of the atomic clouds under
free fall shows some symmetry, but it was only observed under certain
conditions

<h3>Role of Helium Bubbles and Voids on the Property of Nanocrystalline  Tungsten</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12255</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yang Zhang, Jason Trelewicz</i>
<p>This manuscript embarks on an inquiry into the influence of helium
implantation on nanocrystalline tungsten, a contender for plasma-facing
components (PFCs) in nuclear fusion reactors. The study underscores the
inevitability of helium retention in tungsten due to the anticipated high flux
of helium atoms from D-T fusion reactions in future reactors such as ITER and
DEMO. This retention, potentially culminating in surface blistering and grain
boundary embrittlement, propels an investigation into the helium's preferential
substitutional configuration over interstitial within tungsten's lattice,
leading to cavity and bubble formation. Atomistic tensile testing simulations,
exploiting a helium-specific interatomic potential, dissect the ramifications
of helium concentration and voids on tungsten's mechanical properties across
grain sizes of 10nm and 15nm. The presence of helium at grain boundaries
instigates detachment, influencing structural behaviors under strain. Notably,
the study reveals a dichotomy in helium's effect: benign at concentrations up
to the critical point, beyond which significant embrittlement and elastic
softening occur, corroborating with theoretical predictions on helium-induced
grain boundary embrittlement. This nuanced exploration delineates the intricate
dance between helium implantation levels, grain size, and the ensuing
mechanical property alterations in nanocrystalline tungsten, casting light on
its viability and endurance as a PFC material under the rigorous conditions
forecasted in fusion reactors.

<h3>Primary Defect Production in Doped Iron Grain Boundaries during Low  Energy Collision Cascades</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12257" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12257</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yang Zhang, Blas P. Uberuaga, Enrique Martinez Saez, Jason R. Trelewicz</i>
<p>This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs)
and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role
of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research
delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies,
influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision
cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show
a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly
modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is
shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect
production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB
characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the
investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a
crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB
configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For
instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry
can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point
to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced
radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By
tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials
can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage,
offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other
radiation-prone environments.

<h3>The Role of Temperature on Irradiation Defect Evolution near Surfaces  and Grain Boundaries in Tungsten</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12259" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12259</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yang Zhang, Jason R. Trelewicz</i>
<p>This study explores the impact of temperature on defect dynamics in tungsten,
emphasizing its application in nuclear fusion reactors as Plasma Facing
Components (PFCs). Through atomistic simulations, the research elucidates the
intricate interplay of defect production, annihilation, and redistribution
under irradiation at room (300K) and elevated temperatures (1000K). It
demonstrates that higher temperatures significantly increase the number and
mobility of defects, leading to a substantial rise in the total number of
surviving Frenkel Pairs (FPs), with a notable preference for surface
distribution. This redistribution is attributed to energy gradient-driven
relocation processes, enhanced by the defects' increased mobility at elevated
temperatures. Moreover, the study reveals that elevated temperatures promote
biased accumulation of interstitial defects in grain boundaries, especially in
configurations that facilitate efficient interstitial migration, indicating a
strategy for minimizing lattice interstitial accumulation under irradiation.
These findings underscore the critical role of temperature in modulating
irradiation-induced defect dynamics in tungsten, providing valuable insights
for designing and selecting materials with optimized irradiation resistance for
use in extreme conditions of nuclear fusion reactors. The research suggests a
material design approach that accounts for temperature effects to enhance the
durability and performance of nuclear fusion materials.

<h3>Grain Boundary Defect Production during Successive Displacement Cascades  on a Tungsten Surface</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yang Zhang, Predrag Krstic, Jason R. Trelewicz</i>
<p>This study delves into the complex mechanisms of defect production and
accumulation in nanocrystalline tungsten under irradiation, with a particular
focus on the interplay between grain boundaries and free surfaces. Through
molecular dynamics simulations, the research explores how grain boundaries act
as sinks for irradiation-induced defects, a critical aspect in designing
nanomaterials with enhanced radiation tolerance. The investigation leverages a
novel Modified Wigner-Seitz Analysis to accurately quantify defect trends
amidst dynamic surface reconstruction, providing a nuanced understanding of
defect distribution in response to irradiation. This methodology underscores
the intricate relationship between defect dynamics and the nano-scale structure
of materials, specifically highlighting the role of interfaces in mediating
these dynamics. The findings reveal a complex balance between defect
production, surface interactions, and the influence of pre-existing defects and
temperature on the primary defect production process. Surfaces are shown to
amplify defect production due to biased accumulation of interstitials,
alongside suppressed defect recombination, emphasizing the nuanced nature of

<h3>Wigner-molecule supercrystal in transition-metal dichalcogenide moiré  superlattices: Lessons from the bottom-up approach</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12262</a>

</p><i>Constantine Yannouleas, Uzi Landman</i>
<p>The few-body problem for $N=4$ fermionic charge carriers in a double-well
moir\'{e} quantum dot (MQD), representing the first step in a bottom-up
strategy to investigate formation of molecular supercrystals in transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e superlattices with integral fillings, $\nu >
1$, is solved exactly by employing large-scale exact-diagonalization via full
configuration interaction (FCI) computations. A comparative analysis with the
mean-field solutions of the often used spin-and-space unrestricted Hartree Fock
(sS-UHF) demonstrates the limitations of the UHF method (by itself) to provide
a proper description of the influence of the interdot Coulomb interaction. In
particular, it is explicitly shown for $\nu=2$ that the exact charge densities
(CDs) within each MQD retain the ring-like shape characteristic (for a wide
range of relevant parameters) of a fully isolated MQD, as was found for sliding
Wigner molecules (WMs). This deeply quantum-mechanical behavior contrasts
sharply with the UHF CDs that portray solely orientationally pinned and well
localized dumbbell dimers. An improved CD, which agrees with the FCI-calculated
one, derived from the restoration of the sS-UHF broken parity symmetries is
further introduced, suggesting a beyond-mean-field methodological roadmap for
correcting the sS-UHF results. It is conjectured that the conclusions for the
$\nu=2$ moir\'e TMD superlattice case extend to all cases with integral
fillings that are associated with sliding WMs in isolated MQDs. The case of
$\nu=3$, associated with a pinned WM in isolated MQDs, is an exception.

<p>GaSe is an important member of the post-transition metal chalcogenide family
and is an emerging two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material. Because it is a
van der Waals (vdW) material, it can be fabricated into atomic-scale ultrathin
films, making it suitable for the preparation of compact, heterostructure
devices. In addition, GaSe possesses unusual optical and electronic properties,
such as a shift from an indirect-bandgap single-layer film to a direct-bandgap
bulk material, rare intrinsic p-type conduction, and nonlinear optical
behaviors. These properties make GaSe an appealing candidate for the
fabrication of field-effect transistors, photodetectors, and photovoltaics.
However, the wafer-scale production of pure GaSe single crystal thin films
remains challenging. This study develops an approach for the direct growth of
GaSe thin films on GaAs substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. It yields
smooth thin GaSe films with a {\gamma}'-configuration, a recently-proposed
novel polymorph. We analyze the formation mechanism of {\gamma}'-GaSe using
density functional theory, finding that this polymorph is stabilized by Ga
vacancies. Finally, we investigate the growth conditions of GaSe, providing
valuable insights for exploring 2D/3D quasi-vdW epitaxial growth.

<p>Meeting of non-trivial topology with magnetism results in novel phases of
matter, such as Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) or axion insulator phases. Even
more exotic states with high and tunable Chern numbers are expected at the
contact of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators (IMTIs) and 2D topological
insulators (TIs).Here we synthesize a heterostructures composed of 2D TI and 3D
IMTIs, specifically of bismuth bilayer on top of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family of
compounds and study their electronic properties by means of angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The
epitaxial interface is characterized by hybridized Bi and IMTI electronic
states. The Bi bilayer-derived states on different members of
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-family of materials are similar, except in the region of mixing
with the topological surface states of the substrate. In that region, the new,
substrate dependent interface Dirac state is observed. Our \emph{ab initio}
calculations show rich interface phases with emergence of exchange split 1D
edge states, making the Bi/IMTI heterostructures promising playground for
observation of novel members in the family of quantum Hall effects.

<p>Modern detector technology and highly brilliant fourth-generation
synchrotrons allow to improve the temporal resolution in time-resolved
diffraction studies. Profiting from this, we applied temperature scanning X-ray
photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a Pt-based
metallic glass former in the glass, glass transition region, and supercooled
liquid, covering up to six orders of magnitude in time scales. Our data
demonstrates that the structural alpha-relaxation process is still observable
in the glass, although it is partially masked by a faster source of
decorrelation observed at atomic scale. We present an approach that interprets
these findings as the superposition of heterogeneous liquid-like and
stress-driven ballistic-like atomic motions. This work not only extends the
dynamical range probed by standard isothermal XPCS, but also clarifies the fate
of the alpha-relaxation across the glass transition and provides a new
perception on the anomalous, compressed temporal decay of the density-density
correlation functions observed in metallic glasses and many out-of-equilibrium
soft materials.

<h3>Quantifying the efficiency of principal signal transmission modes in  proteins</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Anil Kumar Sahoo, Richard Schwarzl, Markus S. Miettinen, Roland R. Netz</i>
<p>On the microscopic level, biological signal transmission relies on
coordinated structural changes in allosteric proteins that involve sensor and
effector modules. The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission
in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on
signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical
framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit
functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit
functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one
site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at
a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from
simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our
all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric
coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a
blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems
extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal
transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation
modes. Based on the results of mutation experiments, we infer that the most
relevant mode for the biological function of the histidine kinase protein is
the splay deformation.

<h3>Exact thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains at infinite  temperature</h3>

</p><i>Yuuya Chiba, Yasushi Yoneta</i>
<p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in
explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there
has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the
theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems.
Here, we write down analytically, for the first time, thermal eigenstates of
nonintegrable spin chains. We introduce a class of theoretically tractable
volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These
states are thermal, in the most strict sense that they are indistinguishable
from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite
temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an
eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are
nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is
obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a
potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.

<h3>Denoising of Imaginary Time Response Functions with Hankel projections</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yang Yu, Alexander F. Kemper, Chao Yang, Emanuel Gull</i>
<p>Imaginary-time response functions of finite-temperature quantum systems are
often obtained with methods that exhibit stochastic or systematic errors.
Reducing these errors comes at a large computational cost -- in quantum Monte
Carlo simulations, the reduction of noise by a factor of two incurs a
simulation cost of a factor of four. In this paper, we relate certain
imaginary-time response functions to an inner product on the space of linear
operators on Fock space. We then show that data with noise typically does not
respect the positive definiteness of its associated Gramian. The Gramian has
the structure of a Hankel matrix. As a method for denoising noisy data, we
introduce an alternating projection algorithm that finds the closest positive
definite Hankel matrix consistent with noisy data. We test our methodology at
the example of fermion Green's functions for continuous-time quantum Monte
Carlo data and show remarkable improvements of the error, reducing noise by a
factor of up to 20 in practical examples. We argue that Hankel projections
should be used whenever finite-temperature imaginary-time data of response
functions with errors is analyzed, be it in the context of quantum Monte Carlo,
quantum computing, or in approximate semianalytic methodologies.

<p>The growth in data generation necessitates efficient data processing
technologies to address the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional computer
architecture. Memory-driven computing, which integrates non-volatile memory
(NVM) devices in a 3D stack, is gaining attention, with CMOS back-end-of-line
(BEOL) compatible ferroelectric (FE) diodes being ideal due to their
two-terminal design and inherently selector-free nature, facilitating
high-density crossbar arrays. Here, we demonstrate BEOL-compatible,
high-performance FE-diodes scaled to 5, 10, and 20 nm FE
Al0.72Sc0.28N/Al0.64Sc0.36N films. Through interlayer (IL) engineering, we show
substantial improvements in the ON/OFF ratios (>166 times) and rectification
ratios (>176 times) in these scaled devices. The superlative characteristics
also enables 5-bit multi-state operation with a stable retention. We also
experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the counterintuitive result that
the inclusion of an IL can lead to a decrease in the ferroelectric switching
voltage of the device. An in-depth analysis into the device transport
mechanisms is performed, and our compact model aligns seamlessly with the
experimental results. Our results suggest the possibility of using scaled
AlxSc1-xN FE-diodes for high performance, low-power, embedded NVM.

<h3>Unveiling the Dirac feature in the Metallated Carbyne as a Potential  Platform for Exploring Widely Separated Majorana Fermions</h3>

<p>The realization of next-generation quantum computing devices is hindered by
the formidable challenge of detecting and manipulating Majorana Fermion in
nanomaterials. In this study, we explore a new approach of detecting Majorana
Fermion in a metallated carbyne nanowire array. Through comprehensive
optimizations, we successfully achieved a local magnetic moment exceeding
3{\mu}B, with the average magnetic moment of the entire metallated carbyne
surpassing 1{\mu}B. Surprisingly, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the
ferromagnetic Ru metallated carbyne, when coupled with a superconducting Ru
substrate, is already able to demonstrate the symmetric opening of a Dirac gap
at the gamma point. We discovered that the kink structure of the metallated
carbyne plays a crucial role in modulating its topological properties.
Moreover, we identified the origin of magnetic hybridization which is
intricately linked to the distinctive features found in one-dimensional carbon
structures. Our findings not only uncover the unconventional ferromagnetism
observed in metallated carbyne but also present an exciting opportunity to
realize carbon-based materials capable of hosting Majorana Zero Modes (MZM).
This discovery has the potential to further stabilize MZM by decoupling the
orbital perturbation from the MZM itself.

<h3>Electrical transport crossover and large magnetoresistance in selenium  deficient van der Waals HfSe2-x</h3>

<p>Transition metal dichalcogenides have received much attention in the past
decade not only due to the new fundamental physics, but also due to the
emergent applications in these materials. Currently chalcogenide deficiencies
in TMDs are commonly believed either during the high temperature growth
procedure or in the nanofabrication process resulting significant changes of
their reported physical properties in the literature. Here we perform a
systematic study involving pristine stochiometric HfSe2, Se deficient HfSe1.9
and HfSe1.8. Stochiometric HfSe2 transport results show semiconducting behavior
with a gap of 1.1eV. Annealing HfSe2 under high vacuum at room temperature
causes the Se loss resulting in HfSe1.9, which shows unconventionally large
magnetoresistivity following the extended Kohler's rule at low temperatures
below 50 K. Moreover, a clear electrical resistivity crossover, mimicking the
metal-insulator transition, is observed in the HfSe1.9 single crystal. Further
increasing the degree of deficiency in HfSe1.8 results in complete metallic
electrical transport at all temperatures down to 2K. Such a drastic difference
in the transport behaviors of stoichiometric and Se-deficient HfSe2 further
emphasizes that defect control and engineering could be an effective method
that could be used to tailor the electronic structure of 2D materials,
potentially unlock new states of matter, or even discover new materials.

<p>The process of environmental oxidation is pivotal in determining the physical
and chemical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Its impact holds
great significance for the practical application of these materials in
nanoscale devices functioning under ambient conditions. This study delves into
the influence of O2 and O3 exposure on the structural and electronic
characteristics of the C2N monolayer, focusing on the kinetics of adsorption
and dissociation reactions. Employing first-principles density functional
theory calculations alongside climbing image nudged elastic band calculations,
we observe that the C2N monolayer exhibits resistance to oxidation and
ozonation, evidenced by energy barriers of 0.05 eV and 0.56 eV, respectively.
These processes are accompanied by the formation of epoxide (C-O-C) groups.
Furthermore, the dissociation mechanism involves charge transfers from the
monolayer to the molecules. Notably, the dissociated configurations demonstrate
higher bandgaps compared to the pristine C2N monolayer, attributed to robust
C-O hybridization. These findings suggest the robustness of C2N monolayers
against oxygen/ozone exposures, ensuring stability for devices incorporating
these materials.

</p><i>Yu-Hao Shen, Jun-Ding Zheng, Wen-Yi Tong, Xian-Gang Wan, Chun-Gang Duan</i>
<p>Twisted van der Waals bilayers provide ideal two-dimensional (2D) platforms
to study the interplay between spin and charge degree of freedom of electron.
An exotic dielectric response behavior in such system is what we find here
through the investigation of twisted bilayer MoS2 with two different stackings
but same size of the commensurate supercell, which forms H-type like and R-type
like stacked bilayer system. Our first-principles calculations show that
applying an out-of-plane electric field gives rise to different response of the
electric polarization, whose susceptibility is suppressed in H-type like case
compared with that of R-type like one. Further analysis shows the dielectric
response to perpendicular electric field is linked to the moire ferroelectric
dipole texture. Their underlying link comes from that, through Rashba
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, the external electric field tends to change
the internal pseudo-spin texture, which further depends on the twist induced
dipole texture. Consequently, the suppression of dielectric response can be
attributed to the topology protection of such ferroelectric dipole structure.

efficiently generating crystals based on target properties. This paper proposes
the Con-CDVAE model, an extension of the Crystal Diffusion Variational

innovative components, design a two-step training method, and develop three
unique generation strategies to enhance model performance. The effectiveness of
Con-CDVAE is demonstrated through extensive testing under various conditions,
including both single and combined property targets. Ablation studies further
underscore the critical role of the new components in achieving our model's
performance. Additionally, we validate the physical credibility of the

confirming Con-CDVAE's potential in material science research.

<p>Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple
areas of physics, yet they remain un-studied in systems with nonlinear
interactions that are beyond Kerr-type. Here, we establish these two

interactions. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of
nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear
dynamics. We show edge modes that serve as topologically protected fixed points
of chiral-symmetric nonlinear dynamics. Our theoretical framework paves the way
towards the topological classification of general nonlinear dynamics.

<h3>Thermoelectric properties of marcasite-type compounds MSb$_2$ (M = Ta,  Nb): A combined experimental and computational study</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shamim Sk, Naoki Sato, Takao Mori</i>
<p>Here, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the marcasite-type
compounds MSb$_2$ (M = Ta, Nb) in the temperature range of 310-730 K. These
compounds were synthesized by a solid-state reaction followed by the spark
plasma sintering process. The Rietveld refinement method confirms the
monoclinic phase with space group C2/m for both compounds. The observed values
of Seebeck coefficients exhibit non-monotonic behaviour in the studied
temperature range, with the maximum magnitude of -14.4 and -22.7 $\mu$V
K$^{-1}$ for TaSb$_2$ and NbSb$_2$, respectively at ~444 K. The negative sign
of S in the full temperature window signifies the n-type behaviour of these
compounds. Both electrical and thermal conductivities show an increasing trend
with temperature. The experimentally observed thermoelectric properties are
understood through the first-principles DFT and Boltzmann transport equation. A
pseudogap in the density of states around the Fermi level characterizes the
semimetallic behaviour of these compounds. The multi-band electron and hole
pockets were found to be mainly responsible for the temperature dependence of
transport properties. The experimental power factors are found to be ~0.09 and
~0.42 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ at 310 K for TaSb2 and NbSb2, respectively. From the
DFT-based calculations, the maximum possible power factors for p-type
conduction are predicted as ~1.14 and ~1.74 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$, while these
values are found to be ~1.16 and ~1.80 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ for n-type TaSb$_2$
and NbSb$_2$, respectively at 300 K with the corresponding doping
concentrations. The present study suggests that the combined DFT and Boltzmann
transport theory are found to be reasonably good at explaining the experimental
transport properties, and moderate power factors are predicted.

<p>The design and discovery of new materials is fundamental to advancing
scientific and technological innovation. The recent emergence of the materials
genome concept holds great promise in revolutionising materials science by
enabling the systematic utilisation of data for efficient prediction and
optimisation of superior materials. However, the materials genome approach can
be stymied by the vast complexity of design spaces, which often demand
substantial computational resources and sophisticated data processing
capabilities. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel
generative design framework called the non-dominant sorting optimisation-based
generative adversarial networks (NSGAN). Capitalising on the synergies of
genetic algorithms (GA) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), NSGAN
provides a robust and efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional
multi-objective optimisation design problems. To validate the efficacy of the
proposed framework, we applied the model to a comprehensive dataset of
aluminium alloys. Additionally, an online tool was created as a supplementary
resource, offering a brief introduction to this innovative method for the wider
scientific community. This study explores the potential of a predictive and
data-driven approach in material design, indicating a promising pathway for
widespread applications in the field of materials science.

<p>The influence of temperature on the deformation behaviour of the C15 CaAl$_2$
Laves phase, a key constituent for enhancing the mechanical properties of Mg
alloys up to service temperatures of 200 {\deg}C, remains largely unexplored.
This study presents, for the first time, the nanoscale brittle-to-ductile
transition (BDT) of this intermetallic phase through in situ testing including
nanoindentation, scratch testing, and micropillar splitting conducted at
elevated temperatures. By correlating observations from these techniques,
changes in deformation of CaAl$_2$ were identified in relation to temperature.
High-temperature nanoindentation quantitatively determined the temperature
range for the BDT, and revealed that CaAl$_2$ undergoes a BDT at ~0.55T$_m$,
exhibiting an intermediate region of microplasticity. A noticeable decrease in
nanoindentation hardness was observed at ~450-500 {\deg}C, accompanied by an
increase in residual indent size, while indentation cracking was not observed
above 300 {\deg}C. Results from high-temperature micropillar splitting revealed
cracking and brittle pillar splitting up to 300 {\deg}C, with an increase in
apparent fracture toughness from 0.9 $\pm$ 0.1 MPa$\cdot\sqrt m$ to 2.8 $\pm$
0.3 MPa$\cdot\sqrt m$, and subsequent crack-free plastic deformation from 400
{\deg}C. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the deformed material
from nanoindentation revealed that the BDT of CaAl$_2$ may be attributed to
enhanced dislocation plasticity with increasing temperature.

<br>
</p><i>Amar Bharti, Gopal Dixit</i>
<p>To add to the rapidly progressing field of ultrafast photocurrent, we propose
a universal method to generate photocurrent in normal and topological materials
using a pair of multicycle linearly polarized laser pulses. The interplay of
the fundamental and its second harmonic pulses is studied for the generation of
photocurrent in Weyl semimetals by varying the angle between the polarization
direction, relative intensity, and relative phase delay. It has been found that
the presence of a comparatively weaker second harmonic pulse is sufficient to
generate substantial photocurrent. Moreover, significant photocurrent is
generated even when polarization directions are orthogonal for certain ratios
of the lasers' intensities. In addition, the photocurrent is found to be
susceptible to the delay between the two pulses. We have illustrated that all
our findings are extendable to non-topological and two-dimensional materials,
such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide.

<p>The BCS-BEC crossover realized experimentally with ultra-cold Fermi gases may
be considered as one of the important scientific achievements occurred during
the last several years. The flexibility for operating on these systems on the
experimental side and the full control of the relevant system degrees of
freedom on the theoretical side make quite stringent at a fundamental level the
comparison between the experimental data and the corresponding theoretical
calculations. Here, we briefly survey recent theoretical advances resting on a
diagrammatic approach at equilibrium that improves in a systematic way on the
widely used t-matrix approach, yielding a quite good comparison between theory
and experiments for several physical quantities of interest. It is proposed
that the physical phenomena underlying this theoretical approach may also be
relevant to the superconducting phase of condensed-matter materials which
cannot be described by the standard BCS theory.

skin effect (the localization of all eigenvectors at one edge) and add an
on-site defect in the center. Using a two-scale asymptotic method, we
characterize the long-scale growth and decay of the eigenvectors and derive a
simple and intuitive effective model for the transition that occurs when the
defect is sufficiently large that one of the modes is localized at the defect
site, rather than at the edge of the system.

</p><i>O.S. Awolude, E. Cator, H. Don</i>
<p>The SIS process on a graph poses many challenges. An important problem is to
identify characteristics of the metastable behaviour. Existing mean-field
methods (such as Heterogeneous Mean Field and the N-intertwined Mean Field
Approximation) overestimate the metastable infected fraction, because they
ignore correlations. Especially in sparse graphs, this leads to serious
inaccuracies. We propose quenched and annealed methods incorporating
correlations and giving significantly more accurate approximations. We use the
Erd\"os-R\'enyi graph as a test case, but the methods can be generalized
easily. Our methods are computationally very friendly and can be applied to
fairly large graphs, in contrast with some other second-order mean field
approximations.

<h3>Discrepancies in dynamic yield stress measurements of cement pastes</h3>

<p>The dynamic yield stress associated with the flow cessation of cement pastes
is measured using a rheometer equipped with various shear geometries such as
vane, helical, sandblasted co-axial cylinders, and serrated parallel plates, as
well as with the mini-cone spread test. Discrepancies in yield stress values
are observed for cement pastes at various volume fractions, with one to two
orders of magnitude difference between vane, helical and mini-cone spread
measurements on the one hand, and co-axial cylinder and parallel plate
measurements on the other hand. To understand this discrepancy, the flow
profile of a cement paste in the parallel-plate geometry is investigated with a
high-speed camera, revealing the rapid formation of an un-sheared band near the
static bottom plate. The width of this band depends upon the rotational
velocity of the top plate, and upon the shear time. Recalculation of shear
stress shows that the reduced sheared gap alone cannot explain the low measured
yield stress. Further exploration suggests the formation of zones with lower
particle content, possibly linked to cement particle sedimentation. Here, we
argue that the complex nature of cement pastes, composed of negatively buoyant
non-Brownian particles with attractive interactions due to highly charged
nano-size hydration products, accounts for their complex rheological behavior.

<h3>Effects of forward disorder on quasi-1D superconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12597</a>
<br>
</p><i>Giacomo Morpurgo, Thierry Giamarchi</i>
<p>We study the competition between disorder and singlet superconductivity in a
quasi-1d system. We investigate the applicability of the Anderson theorem,
namely that time-reversal conserving (non-magnetic) disorder does not impact
the critical temperature, by opposition to time-reversal breaking disorder
(magnetic). To do so we examine a quasi-1d system of spin 1/2 fermions with
attractive interactions and forward scattering disorder using field theory
(bosonization). By computing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$),
we find that for non-magnetic disorder the Anderson theorem also holds in the
quasi-1D geometry. On the contrary, magnetic disorder has an impact on the
critical temperature, that we investigate by deriving renormalization group
(RG) equations describing the competition between the disorder and the
interactions. Computing the critical temperature as a function of disorder
strength, we see that different regimes arise depending on the strength of
interactions. We discuss possible platforms where to observe this in cold atoms
and condensed matter.

<h3>Large Rashba spin-orbit coupling in metallic SrTaO$_3$ thin films</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12612" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12612</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hikaru Okuma, Yumiko Katayama, Fukunobu Kadowaki, Yuki Tokumoto, Kazunori Ueno</i>
<p>Epitaxial thin films of SrTaO$_3$ with thickness ($t$) smaller than 74 nm
were successfully fabricated on an insulator
(LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$AlTaO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrate. Films with $t$ above
8.6 nm showed metallic conduction. Both conductivity and a mobility showed a
decrease with increasing $t$ above 42 nm, suggesting the instability of thick
SrTaO$_3$ films. This instability was also supported by TEM image and XRD
intensity. For the metallic films with $t$ below 25 nm, energy band splitting
due to spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta$$_{so}$) and Rashba parameter
($\alpha$$_R$) were deduced from an analysis of a magnetoresistance using
two-dimensional weak antilocalization theory. The values of $\Delta$$_{so}$
ranged from 26 to 120 meV, which were the largest among other metallic oxide
films, such as SrNbO$_3$, SrIrO$_3$, and La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ thin
films, indicating that spin-orbit coupling in SrTaO$_3$ was the largest among
the metallic perovskite oxides reported so far. The values of $\alpha$$_R$ for
our SrTaO$_3$ films ranged from $8.8 \times$10$^{-13}$ to $1.7
\times$10$^{-12}$ eV m, which were much larger than those reported for other
metallic oxide thin films.

<p>The low-temperature properties of one and two layers of parahydrogen adsorbed
on graphite are investigated theoretically through Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. We adopt a microscopic model that explicitly includes the
corrugation of the substrate. We study the phase diagram of a monolayer up to
second layer promotion, and the possible occurrence of superfluidity in the
second layer. We obtain results down to a temperature as low as 8 mK. We find
second-layer promotion to occur at a considerably greater coverage than
obtained in previous calculations and estimated experimentally; moreover, we
find no evidence of a possible finite superfluid response in the second layer,
disproving recent theoretical predictions.

<h3>PH-NODE: A DFPT and finite displacement supercell based python code for  searching nodes in topological phononic materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12643</a>
<br>
</p><i>Prakash Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</i>
<p>Exploring the topological physics of phonons is fundamentally important for
understanding various practical applications. Here, we present a
density-functional perturbation theory and finite displacement supercell based
Python 3 software package called PH-NODE for efficiently computing phonon nodes
present in real material through a first-principle approach. The present
version of the code is interfaced with the WIEN2k, Elk, and ABINIT packages. In
order to benchmark the code, four different types of materials are considered,
which include (i) FeSi, a well-known double-Weyl point; (ii) LiCaAs, a
half-Heusler single-type-I Weyl topological phonon (TP); and (iii) ScZn,
coexisting nodal-line and nodal-ring TPs; (iv) TiS, six pairs of bulk Weyl
nodes. In FeSi, the node points are found at ${\Gamma}$(0, 0, 0) and R(0.5,
0.5, 0.5) high symmetric points. Also, there are 21 energy values at which the
node points are situated, corresponding to the full Brillouin Zone. For LiCaAs,
the previously reported literature claims that there is a node point along the
W-X high symmetry direction between the highest longitudinal acoustic and the
lowest transverse optical branch, while in our DFT calculations, a gap of 0.17
meV is found. Furthermore, ScZn hosts six nodal-ring TPs phonons at the
boundary planes of the Brillouin Zone in the vicinity of the M high-symmetric
point. In addition to this, straight-line TPs are also found along the
${\Gamma}$-X and ${\Gamma}$-R high symmetric directions. Moreover, for TiS, six
weyl node points (WP1, WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5 and WP6) are found along H-K
high-symmetric direction. The results obtained from the PH-NODE code are in
good agreement with the experimentally and theoretically reported data for each
material.

<h3>ac Hall Effect and Photon Drag of Superconducting Condensate</h3>

<br>
</p><i>S. V. Mironov, A. S. Mel'nikov, A. I. Buzdin</i>
<p>We suggest a theoretical description of the photogalvanic phenomena arising
in superconducting condensates in the field of electromagnetic wave. The ac
Hall effect and photon drag are shown to originate from the second-order
nonlinear response of superconducting carriers caused by the suppression of
their concentration due to the combined influence of the electron - hole
asymmetry and charge imbalance generated by the incident electromagnetic wave.
Starting from the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory with the complex
relaxation constant we develop a phenomenological description of these
phenomena and investigate the resulting behavior of the dc supercurrent and
second harmonic induced by microwave radiation incident on a superconductor
surface.

<h3>Zeolite Adsorption Property Prediction using Deep Learning</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Marko Petković, José Manuel Vicent-Luna, Vlado Menkovski, Sofía Calero</i>
<p>The ability to efficiently predict adsorption properties of zeolites can be
of large benefit in accelerating the design process of novel materials. The
existing configuration space for these materials is wide, while existing
molecular simulation methods are computationally expensive. In this work, we
propose a model which is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster at adsorption
properties compared to molecular simulations. To validate the model, we
generated datasets containing various aluminium configurations for the MOR,
MFI, RHO and ITW zeolites along with their heat of adsorptions and Henry
coefficients for CO$_2$, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The predictions
obtained from the Machine Learning model are in agreement with the values
obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, confirming that the model can be
used for property prediction. Furthermore, we show that the model can be used
for identifying adsorption sites. Finally, we evaluate the capability of our
model for generating novel zeolite configurations by using it in combination
with a genetic algorithm.

<h3>Diffusion, viscosity and linear rheology of valence-limited disordered  fluids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12665</a>
<br>
</p><i>Samuel S. Gomez, Lorenzo Rovigatti</i>
<p>We numerically investigate the dynamics and linear rheology of disordered
systems made of patchy particles, focussing on the role of valence, temperature
and bonding mechanism. We demonstrate that the dynamics is enslaved to bonding,
giving rise to an activated behaviour at low temperature. By independently
computing the diffusion constant and the viscosity from the simulations, we
also confirm the validity of the Stokes-Einstein relation in valence-limited
systems, with two caveats: (i) the diffusion constant requires a finite-size
correction, at least at the intermediate density we investigate, and (ii) there
is the onset of a breakdown that appears at the lowest temperatures considered.
Finally, our results show that the storage and loss moduli of mixtures of
divalent and $M$-valent particles exhibit an apparent power-law dependence on
frequency, hinting at the possibility of using the composition to finely tune
the rheological response of these materials. Our results compare well with
literature experimental data on valence-limited DNA nanostars. In addition, the
wealth of data we present and analyse here will help to develop and test
theoretical frameworks aimed at describing the dynamics of flexible
limited-valence particles that self-assemble into disordered networks.

<h3>Unraveling the dynamics of magnetization in topological  insulator-ferromagnet heterostructures via spin-orbit torque</h3>

</p><i>Taekoo Oh, Naoto Nagaosa</i>
<p>Spin-orbit coupling stands as a pivotal determinant in the realm of condensed
matter physics. In recent, its profound influence on spin dynamics opens up a
captivating arena with promising applications. Notably, the topological
insulator-ferromagnet heterostructure has been recognized for inducing spin
dynamics through applied current, driven by spin-orbit torque. Building upon
recent observations revealing spin flip signals within this heterostructure,
our study elucidates the conditions governing spin flips by studying the
magnetization dynamics. We establish that the interplay between spin-anisotropy
and spin-orbit torque plays a crucial role in shaping the physics of
magnetization dynamics within the heterostructure. Furthermore, we categorize
various modes of magnetization dynamics, constructing a comprehensive phase
diagram across distinct energy scales, damping constants, and applied
frequencies. This research not only offers insights into controlling spin
direction but also charts a new pathway to the practical application of
spin-orbit coupled systems.

<h3>Optimizing Leapover Lengths of Lévy Flights with Resetting</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12727" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12727</a>
<br>
</p><i>Mattia Radice, Giampaolo Cristadoro</i>
<p>We consider a one-dimensional search process under stochastic resetting
conditions. A target is located at $b\geq0$ and a searcher, starting from the
origin, performs a discrete-time random walk with independent jumps drawn from
a heavy-tailed distribution. Before each jump, there is a given probability $r$
of restarting the walk from the initial position. The efficiency of a "myopic
search" - in which the search stops upon crossing the target for the first time
- is usually characterized in terms of the first-passage time $\tau$. On the
other hand, great relevance is encapsulated by the leapover length $l =
x_{\tau} - b$, which measures how far from the target the search ends. For
symmetric heavy-tailed jump distributions, in the absence of resetting the
average leapover is always infinite. Here we show instead that resetting
induces a finite average leapover $\ell_b(r)$ if the mean jump length is
finite. We compute exactly $\ell_b(r)$ and determine the condition under which
resetting allows for nontrivial optimization, i.e., for the existence of $r^*$
such that $\ell_b(r^*)$ is minimal and smaller than the average leapover of the
single jump.

<h3>Two-level systems and harmonic excitations in a mean-field anharmonic  quantum glass</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12740" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12740</a>
<br>
</p><i>Thibaud Maimbourg</i>
<p>Structural glasses display at low temperature a set of anomalies in
thermodynamic observables. The prominent example is the linear-in-temperature
scaling of the specific heat, at odds with the Debye cubic scaling found in
crystals, due to acoustic phonons. Such an excess of specific heat in amorphous
solids is thought of arising from phenomenological soft excitations dubbed
tunneling two-level systems (TTLS). Their nature as well as their statistical
properties remain elusive from a first-principle viewpoint. In this work we
investigate the canonically quantized version of the KHGPS model, a mean-field
glass model of coupled anharmonic oscillators, across its phase diagram, with
an emphasis on the specific heat. The thermodynamics is solved in a
semiclassical expansion. We show that in the replica-symmetric region of the
model, up to the marginal glass transition line where replica symmetry gets
continuously broken, a disordered version of the Debye approximation holds: the
specific heat is dominated by harmonic vibrational excitations inducing a
power-law scaling at the transition, ruled by random matrix theory. This
mechanism generalizes a previous semiclassical argument in the literature. We
then study the marginal glass phase where the semiclassical expansion becomes
non-perturbative due to the emergence of instantons that overcome disordered
Debye behavior. Inside the glass phase, a variational solution to the instanton
approach provides the prevailing excitations as TTLS, which generate a linear
specific heat. This phase thus hosts a mix of TTLS and harmonic excitations
generated by interactions. We finally suggest to go beyond the variational
approximation through an analogy with the spin-boson model.

<h3>Acoustoelectric non-local spin wave power detector for studying  magnon-phonon coupling</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Hiroki Matsumoto, Yasuhiro Todaka, Takuya Kawada, Masashi Kawaguchi, Masamitsu Hayashi</i>
<p>We have developed a simple detection scheme to study spin waves excited by
surface acoustic wave (SAW) in ferromagnetic thin films. Metallic antennas made
of Ta and a ferromagnetic element are placed along the SAW propagation path.
The SAW excites spin waves in the ferromagnetic element and induces
acoustoelectric current in the antennas, which are detected as a DC voltage.
The DC voltage takes an extremum at the spin wave resonance condition, which
demonstrates that the antenna acts as a non-local spin wave detector. The
antennas placed before and after the ferromagnetic element along the SAW
propagation path can probe spin wave excitation from reflected and transmitted
SAWs, respectively. Interestingly, we find characteristics of spin wave
excitations that are different for the reflected and transmitted SAWs: the
former excites spin waves with larger frequency with broader linewidth compared
to the latter. The results show that the antennas act as a non-local spin wave
power detector and can be used to map out the spin wave spectra in a unique
way, providing insights into the magnon-phonon coupling in magnetic
nanostructures fabricated on phononic SAW devices.

<br>
</p><i>Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg</i>
<p>Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating
particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a
very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo
(EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703
(2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In
addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the
system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles
interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential.
In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order
of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite
time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation
speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness
of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low
temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the
Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously
reported.

<h3>Strong-coupling critical behavior in three-dimensional lattice Abelian  gauge models with charged $N$-component scalar fields and $SO(N)$ symmetry</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</i>
<p>We consider a three-dimensional lattice Abelian Higgs gauge model for a
charged $N$-component scalar field ${\phi}$, which is invariant under $SO(N)$
global transformations for generic values of the parameters. We focus on the
strong-coupling regime, in which the kinetic Hamiltonian term for the gauge
field is a small perturbation, which is irrelevant for the critical behavior.
The Hamiltonian depends on a parameter $v$ which determines the global symmetry
of the model and the symmetry of the low-temperature phases. We present
renormalization-group predictions, based on a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective
description that relies on the identification of the appropriate order
parameter and on the symmetry-breaking patterns that occur at the
strong-coupling phase transitions. For $v=0$, the global symmetry group of the
model is $SU(N)$; the corresponding model may undergo continuous transitions
only for $N=2$. For $v\not=0$, i.e., in the $SO(N)$ symmetric case, continuous
transitions (in the Heisenberg universality class) are possible also for $N=3$
and 4. We perform Monte Carlo simulations for $N=2,3,4,6$, to verify the
renormalization-group predictions. Finite-size scaling analyses of the
numerical data are in full agreement.

<p>We present dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) incorporating general
inhomogeneous, incompressible, time dependent background flows and inertia,
describing externally driven passive colloidal systems out of equilibrium. We
start by considering the underlying nonequilibrium Langevin dynamics, including
the effect of the local velocity of the surrounding liquid bath, to obtain the
nonlinear, nonlocal partial differential equations governing the evolution of
the (coarse--grained) density and velocity fields describing the dynamics of
colloids. Additionally, we show both with heuristic arguments, and by numerical
solution, that our equations and solutions agree with existing DDFTs in the
overdamped (high friction) limit. We provide numerical solutions that model the
flow of hard spheres, in both unbounded and confined domains, and compare to
previously--derived DDFTs with and without the background flow.

<p>A strange metal is an exotic state of correlated quantum matter; intensive
efforts are ongoing to decipher its nature. Here we explore whether the quantum
Fisher information (QFI), a concept from quantum metrology, can provide new
insight. We use inelastic neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo
simulations to study a Kondo destruction quantum critical point, where strange
metallicity is associated with fluctuations beyond a Landau order parameter. We
find that the QFI probed away from magnetic Bragg peaks, where the effect of
magnetic ordering is minimized, increases strongly and without a characteristic
scale as the strange metal forms with decreasing temperature, evidencing its
unusual entanglement properties. Our work opens a new direction for studies
across strange metal platforms.

bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a
newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases
display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an
electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at
ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313
electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering
especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer
selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those
of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects
in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital

<h3>Giant electrode effect on tunneling magnetoresistance and  electroresistance in van der Waals intrinsic multiferroic tunnel junctions</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Zhi Yan, Ruixia Yang, Cheng Fang, Wentian Lu, Xiaohong Xu</i>
<p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) with multiple
nonvolatile resistive states are highly suitable for new physics and
next-generation storage electronics. However, currently reported vdW-MFTJs are
based on two types of materials, i.e., vdW ferromagnetic and ferroelectric
materials, forming a multiferroic system. This undoubtedly introduces
additional interfaces, increasing the complexity of experimental preparation.
Herein, we engineer vdW intrinsic MFTJs utilizing bilayer VS$_2$. By employing
the nonequilibrium Green's function combined with density functional theory, we
systematically investigate the influence of three types of electrodes
(including non-vdW pure metal Ag/Au, vdW metallic 1T-MoS$_2$/2H-PtTe$_2$, and
vdW ferromagnetic metallic Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$) on the electronic
transport properties of VS$_2$-based intrinsic MFTJs. We demonstrate that these
MFTJs manifest a giant electrode-dependent electronic transport characteristic
effect. Comprehensively comparing these electrode pairs, the
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ electrode combination exhibits optimal transport
properties, the maximum TMR (TER) can reach 10949\% (69\%) and the minimum
resistance-area product (RA) is 0.45 $\Omega$$\mu$m$^{2}$, as well as the
perfect spin filtering and negative differential resistance effects. More
intriguingly, TMR (TER) can be further enhanced to 34000\% (380\%) by applying
an external bias voltage (0.1 V), while RA can be reduced to 0.16
$\Omega$$\mu$m$^{2}$ under the influence of biaxial stress (-3\%). Our proposed
concept of designing vdW-MFTJs using intrinsic multiferroic materials points
towards new avenues in experimental exploration.

</p><i>Felix-Ekkehard von Horstig, Lorenzo Peri, Sylvain Barraud, Jason A. W. Robinson, Monica Benito, Frederico Martins, M. Fernando Gonzalez-Zalba</i>
<p>In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable
mechanism for electrical spin readout requiring only two bound spins for its
implementation which, in conjunction with charge sensing techniques, has led to
high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors.
However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin
readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a
method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy
detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are
dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect different spin
measurement outcomes selectively and positively. We demonstrate the method
using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a
silicon p-type transistor and show spin selective and positive readout of
different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii)
low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the
detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1-8~$\mu$s. Our method should help
perform high-fidelity projective spin measurements in systems subject to strong
SOC and may facilitate quantum tomography and state leakage studies.

<h3>P-wave pairing near a spin-split Josephson junction</h3>

</p><i>Rubén Seoane Souto, Dushko Kuzmanovski, Ignacio Sardinero, Pablo Burset, Alexander V. Balatsky</i>
<p>Superconductivity and magnetism are competing effects that can coexist in
certain regimes. Their co-existence leads to unexpected new behaviors that
include the onset of exotic electron pair mechanisms and topological phases. In
this work, we study the properties of a Josephson junction between two
spin-split superconductors. The spin-splitting in the superconductors can arise
from either the coupling to a ferromagnetic material or an external magnetic
field. The properties of the junction are dominated by the Andreev bound states
that are also split. One of these states can cross the superconductor's Fermi
level, leading to a ground state transition characterized by a suppressed
supercurrent. We interpret the supercurrent blockade as coming from a dominance
of p-wave pairing close to the junction, where electrons at both sides of the
junction pair. To support this interpretation, we analyze the different pairing
channels and show that p-wave pairing is favored in the case where the
magnetization of the two superconductors is parallel and suppressed in the
anti-parallel case. We also analyze the noise spectrum that shows signatures of
the ground state transition in the form of an elevated zero-frequency noise.

<p>The discovery of graphene, one of the most-studied materials in condensed
matter physics due to its singular mechanical, optical, and electronic
properties, was enabled by manual ``Scotch Tape'' exfoliation. Nearly two
decades later, this method is still widely used to obtain chemically-pristine
flakes of graphene and other 2D van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, the
yield of large, pristine flakes with uniform thickness is inconsistent. Thus,
significant time and effort are required to exfoliate and locate flakes
suitable for fabricating multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we
describe a relatively affordable tabletop device (the ''eXfoliator'') that can
reproducibly control key parameters and largely automate the exfoliation
process. In a typical exfoliation run, the eXfoliator produces 3 or more large
($\ge400\ \mu$m$^2$) high-quality monolayers, allowing new users to produce
large pristine graphene monolayers at a rate comparable to manual exfoliation
by an experienced user. We use an automated mapping system and computer vision
algorithm to locate candidate flakes.

<p>We report a detailed investigation of the Fermi surface in the layered Dirac
semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, which hosts quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) topological
electronic properties. We have investigated the magnetoresistance and magnetic
behaviour in high-quality TaNiTe$_5$ single crystals. Pronounced Shubnikov-de
Haas (SdH) and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are observed in magnetic
fields above 3T and at temperatures of up to 22K. Five fundamental frequencies
and light effective quasiparticle masses are obtained by fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) and Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula fits. The high
resolution of the low-temperature FFT spectra allows us to investigate
individual peaks in detail for the magnetic fields applied along all three
crystallographic axes and in the a-c plane. The extracted values for the Berry
phase of the obtained Fermi pockets approach $\pi$, demonstrating the
nontrivial topological electronic properties of layered TaNiTe$_5$. The
observed quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance and magnetization data
are consistent with ultra-high mobility Dirac carriers in the conduction band.

<p>The anomalous Nernst effect generates transverse voltage to the applied
thermal gradient in magnetically ordered systems. The effect was previously
considered excluded in compensated magnetic materials with collinear ordering.
However, in the recently identified class of compensated magnetic materials,
dubbed altermagnets, time-reversal symmetry breaking in the electronic band
structure makes the presence of the anomalous Nernst effect possible despite
the collinear spin arrangement. In this work, we investigate epitaxial Mn5Si3
thin films known to be an altermagnetic candidate. We show that the material
manifests a sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient despite the small net
magnetization of the films. The measured magnitudes of the anomalous Nernst
coefficient reach a scale of microVolts per Kelvin. We support our
magneto-thermoelectric measurements by density-functional theory calculations
of the material's spin-split electronic structure, which allows for the finite
Berry curvature in the reciprocal space. Furthermore, we present our
calculations of the intrinsic Berry-curvature Nernst conductivity, which agree
with our experimental observations.
