<h3>Density Mediated Spin Correlations Drive Edge to Bulk Flow Transition in  Active Chiral Matter</h3>

We demonstrate that edge currents develop in active chiral matter -- composed
of spinning disk-shaped grains with chirally arranged tilted legs confined in a
circular vibrating chamber -- due to boundary shielding over a wide range of
densities corresponding to a gas, fluid, and crystal. The edge currents are
then shown to increasingly drive circulating bulk flows with area fraction
$\phi$ due to increasing spin-coupling between neighbors mediated by frictional
contacts, as percolating clusters develop. Edge currents are observed even in
the dilute limit. While, at low $\phi$, the average flux vanishes except within
a distance of a single particle diameter of the boundary, the penetration depth
grows with increasing $\phi$ till a solid body rotation is achieved
corresponding to the highest packing, where the particles are fully caged with
hexagonal order and spin in phase with the entire packing. A coarse-grained
model, based on the increased collisional interlocking of the particles with
$\phi$ and the emergence of order, captures the observed flow fields.

<h3>Significant CO$_2$ photoreduction on a high-entropy oxynitride</h3>

CO$_2$ photoreduction on photocatalysts is a nature-friendly solution to
decrease the CO$_2$ amount, but the method still has low efficiency because of
difficult separation and easy recombination of charge carriers in available
catalysts. In this study, a high-entropy oxynitride was introduced as an active
photocatalyst for photoreduction. The material had a chemical composition of
TiZrNbHfTaO$_6$N$_3$ and was produced by a high-pressure torsion method
followed by oxidation and nitriding. It showed higher photocatalytic CO$_2$ to
CO conversion compared to corresponding high-entropy oxide, benchmark
photocatalyst P25 TiO$_2$, and almost all catalysts introduced in the
literature. The high activity of this oxynitride, which also showed good
chemical stability, was attributed to the large absorbance of light and easy
separation of electrons and holes, the low recombination of charge carriers,
and the high CO$_2$ adsorption on the surface. These findings introduce
high-entropy oxynitrides as promising photocatalysts for CO$_2$ photoreduction.

<h3>Visible-light photocatalytic oxygen production on a high-entropy oxide  by multiple-heterojunction introduction</h3>

High-entropy oxides (HEOs), as multi-component ceramics with high
configurational entropy, have been of recent interest due to their attractive
properties including photocatalytic activity for H2 production and CO2
conversion. However, the photocatalytic activity of HEOs is still limited to
ultraviolet light. In this study, to achieve visible-light-driven
photocatalysis, 10 different heterojunctions were simultaneously introduced in
the Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta-W-O system. The oxide, which was synthesized by a high-pressure
torsion method and oxidation, successfully produced oxygen from water under
visible light without co-catalyst addition. The photocatalytic performance was
attributed to high visible-light absorption, narrow bandgap, appropriate band
structure, presence of multiple heterojunctions and accordingly easy
electron-hole separation and slow recombination. These results not only show
the potential of high-entropy oxides as new visible-light-active
photocatalysts, but also introduce the multiple-heterojunction introduction as
a strategy to achieve photocatalysis under visible light.

<h3>Bandgaps of bent and buckled carbon nanotubes</h3>

Carbon nanotube's large electro-mechanical coupling and robustness makes them
attractive for applications where bending and buckling is present. But the
nature of this coupling is not well understood. Existing theory treats only
weak and homogeneous deformations. We generalize it and derive close-form
expressions for bandgaps under non-homogeneous deformation. The theory is first
compared with a number of published DFT simulations, and then applied to the
specific case of bending and buckling -- where a kink is present. In the
pre-buckling regime, bandgaps change $\propto\pm \kappa^4$ where $\kappa$ is
the bending curvature; inside the kink at post-buckling, while near
criticality, the kink is shallow and the gap is $\propto \pm\kappa^{1/2}$,
where the sign depends on the chiral integers. For a deeper kink but still with
an open cross-section, both the bandgap and local Fermi energy strongly
downshift.

<h3>Electron cooling in graphene enhanced by plasmon-hydron resonance</h3>

Evidence is accumulating for the crucial role of a solid's free electrons in
the dynamics of solid-liquid interfaces. Liquids induce electronic polarization
and drive electric currents as they flow; electronic excitations, in turn,
participate in hydrodynamic friction. Yet, the underlying solid-liquid
interactions have been lacking a direct experimental probe. Here, we study the
energy transfer across liquid-graphene interfaces using ultrafast spectroscopy.
The graphene electrons are heated up quasi-instantaneously by a visible
excitation pulse, and the time evolution of the electronic temperature is then
monitored with a terahertz pulse. We observe that water accelerates the cooling
of the graphene electrons, whereas other polar liquids leave the cooling
dynamics largely unaffected. A quantum theory of solid-liquid heat transfer
accounts for the water-specific cooling enhancement through a resonance between
the graphene surface plasmon mode and the so-called hydrons -- water charge
fluctuations --, particularly the water libration modes, that allows for
efficient energy transfer. Our results provide direct experimental evidence of
a solid-liquid interaction mediated by collective modes and support the
theoretically proposed mechanism for quantum friction. They further reveal a
particularly large thermal boundary conductance for the water-graphene
interface and suggest strategies for enhancing the thermal conductivity in
graphene-based nanostructures.

<h3>Comment on "Validity of path thermodynamic description of reactive  systems: Microscopic simulations''</h3>

<br>
The claims by Baras, Garcia, and Malek Mansour [Phys. Rev. E 107, 014106
(2023)] on the validity of path thermodynamics are ill founded and contradict
well known results. Following up on a previous comment, I show that, for both
models of chemical reaction networks considered in the aforementioned paper,
path thermodynamics yields values of the entropy production rates fully
consistent with those expected from standard chemical thermodynamics in the
large-system limit.

<h3>Quantum spin ice in three-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04657" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04657</a>

Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter whose low-energy physics is
described as the deconfined phase of an emergent gauge theory. With recent
theory proposals and an experiment showing preliminary signs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological order [G. Semeghini et al., Science 374, 1242 (2021)], Rydberg atom
arrays have emerged as a promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid.
In this work, we propose a way to realize a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid in three
spatial dimensions, described by the deconfined phase of $U(1)$ gauge theory in
a pyrochlore lattice Rydberg atom array. We study the ground state phase
diagram of the proposed Rydberg system as a function of experimentally relevant
parameters. Within our calculation, we find that by tuning the Rabi frequency,
one can access both the confinement-deconfinement transition driven by a
proliferation of "magnetic" monopoles and the Higgs transition driven by a
proliferation of "electric" charges of the emergent gauge theory. We suggest
experimental probes for distinguishing the deconfined phase from ordered
phases. This work serves as a proposal to access a confinement-deconfinement
transition in three spatial dimensions on a Rydberg-based quantum simulator.

<h3>Many-body resonances in the avalanche instability of many-body  localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04658" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04658</a>
<br>

<br>
Many-body localized (MBL) systems fail to reach thermal equilibrium under
their own dynamics, even though they are interacting, nonintegrable, and in an
extensively excited state. One instability towards thermalization of MBL
systems is the so-called ``avalanche'', where a locally thermalizing rare
region is able to spread thermalization through the full system. The spreading
of the avalanche may be modeled and numerically studied in finite
one-dimensional MBL systems by weakly coupling an infinite-temperature bath to
one end of the system. We find that the avalanche spreads primarily via strong
many-body resonances between rare near-resonant eigenstates of the closed
system. Thus we find and explore a detailed connection between many-body
resonances and avalanches in MBL systems.

<h3>Kondo Resonance, Pomeranchuk Effect, and Heavy Fermi Liquid in Twisted  Bilayer Graphene -- A Numerical Renormalization Group Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04661</a>
<br>

Low energy electron Hamiltonian in the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
can be equivalently reformulated as a topological heavy fermion model. In this
work, we applied systematic analytical and numerical renormalization group
analyses to a single-impurity version of this model. We obtained a phase
diagram consisting of a Fermi liquid phase in the Kondo regime, a Fermi liquid
phase in the frozen impurity regime, and various local moment phases with
different spin momenta. Remarkably, this single-impurity phase diagram explains
a series of experimental discoveries reported recently: (i) the zero-energy
peak at fillings $1\lesssim |\nu|<2$ observed in STM at low temperatures
($T<1$K), (ii) the cascade of transitions observed in STM at higher
temperatures, (iii) the Pomeranchuk effect at $\nu\approx \pm1$ observed in
transport and compressibility measurements, which show that the Fermi liquid
ground state develops local moments upon heating, and (iv) various transport
experiments showing resistance peaks but no gaps around $\nu\approx \pm1$. For
the first time, we point out that all these phenomena result from a simple
unified mechanism - the Kondo effect. The Fermi liquid state at $\nu\approx
\pm1$ exhibiting the zero-energy peak is stabilized by the Kondo screening with
a Kondo temperature $T_K \approx 1.5$K. A higher temperature will suppress the
Kondo screening and favor a local moment phase that obeys Curie's law and
contributes to an entropy of the order of Boltzmann's constant (per moir\'e
cell). We computed the spectral densities, entropies, and spin susceptibilities
at various fillings and temperatures and obtained results quantitatively
comparable to experiments. We also predict the heavy Fermi liquid as the ground
state in a wide range of fractional fillings and conjecture that it is the
parent state for the observed unconventional superconductivity.

<h3>Kondo Lattice Model of Magic-Angle Twisted-Bilayer Graphene: Hund's  Rule, Local-Moment Fluctuations, and Low-Energy Effective Theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04669</a>
<br>
<i>Haoyu Hu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Alexei M. Tsvelik</i>

We apply a generalized Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to the extended
Anderson-like topological heavy fermion (THF) model for the magic-angle
$(\theta=1.05^{\circ})$ twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) (Phys. Rev. Lett.
129, 047601 (2022)), to obtain its Kondo Lattice limit. In this limit localized
$f$-electrons on a triangular lattice interact with topological conduction
$c$-electrons. By solving the exact limit of the THF model, we show that the
integer fillings $\nu=0, \pm 1, \pm 2$ are controlled by the heavy
$f$-electrons, while $\nu = \pm 3$ is at the border of a phase transition
between two $f$-electron fillings. For $\nu=0, \pm 1, \pm 2$, we then calculate
the RKKY interactions between the $f$-moments in the full model and
analytically prove the SU(4) Hund's rule for the ground state which maintains
that two $f$-electrons fill the same valley-spin flavor. Our (ferromagnetic
interactions in the) spin model dramatically differ from the usual Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic interactions expected at strong coupling. We show the ground
state in some limits can be found exactly by employing a positive semidefinite
"bond-operators" method. We then compute the excitation spectrum of the
$f$-moments in the ordered ground state, prove the stability of the ground
state favored by RKKY interactions, and discuss the properties of the Goldstone
modes, the (reason for the accidental) degeneracy of (some of) the excitation
modes, and the physics of their phase stiffness. We develop a low-energy
effective theory for the $f$-moments and obtain analytic expressions for the
dispersion of the collective modes. We discuss the relevance of our results to
the spin-entropy experiments in twisted bilayer graphene.

<h3>Symmetric Kondo Lattice States in Doped Strained Twisted Bilayer  Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04673" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04673</a>

<br>
<br>
We use the topological heavy fermion (THF) model and its Kondo Lattice (KL)
formulation to study the symmetric Kondo state in twisted bilayer graphene. Via
a large-N approximation, we find a symmetric Kondo (SK) state in KL mode at
fillings $\nu=0,\pm 1,\pm 2$. In the SK state, all symmetries are preserved and
the local moments are Kondo screened by the conduction electrons. At the
mean-field level of the THF model at $\nu=0,\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we also find
a similar symmetric state. We study the stability of the symmetric state by
comparing its energy with the ordered states and find the ordered states to
have lower energy. However, moving away from integer fillings by doping holes
to the light bands, we find the energy difference is reduced, which suggests
the loss of ordering and a tendency towards Kondo screening. In order to
include many-body effects beyond the mean-field approximation, we perform
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations on the THF model. We find the
spin susceptibility follows a Curie behavior at $\nu=0, \pm 1,\pm 2$ down to
$\sim 2\text{K}$ where the onset of screening of the local moment becomes
visible. This hints to very low Kondo temperatures at these fillings, in
agreement with the outcome of our mean-field calculations. At non-integer
filling $\nu=\pm 0.5,\pm 0.8,\pm 1.2$ DMFT shows deviations from a
$1/T$-susceptibility at much higher temperatures, suggesting a more effective
screening of local moments with doping. Finally, we study the effect of a
$C_{3z}$-rotational-symmetry-breaking strain via mean-field approaches and find
that a symmetric phase (that only breaks $C_{3z}$ symmetry) can be stabilized
at sufficiently large strain at $\nu=0,\pm 1, \pm 2$. Our results suggest that
a symmetric Kondo phase is strongly suppressed at integer fillings, but could
be stabilized either at non-integer fillings or by applying strain.

<h3>Anomalous flux state in higher-order topological superconductors</h3>

We investigate the anomalous flux state of interacting higher-order
topological superconductors (HOTSC) protected by rotation symmetries. By
introducing a $\pi$ superconducting flux in 2D HOTSC, we demonstrate the
existence of a robust zero mode trapped at the flux center. Remarkably, the
rotation symmetry and fermion parity display projective representation inside
the $\pi$ flux with $N=2$ supersymmetry algebra. A similar gapless flux pattern
also exists in 3D HOTSCs, the flux lines of which carry anomalous helical modes
that cannot be realized on purely one-dimensional lattice models. Notably,
these exotic phenomena can be manifested in a 2D frustrated quantum magnet
whose low energy excitation characterizes emergent Majoranas with HOTSC band
structure and the $Z_2$ flux exhibiting supersymmetries.

<h3>Aspects of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ rank-2 gauge theory in $(2+1)D$: construction  schemes, holonomies, and sublattice one-form symmetries</h3>

Rank-2 toric code (R2TC), a prototypical archetype of the discrete rank-2
symmetric gauge theory, has properties that differ from those of the standard
toric code. Specifically, it features a blending of UV and IR in its ground
state, restricted mobility of its quasiparticles, and variations in the
braiding statistics of its quasiparticles based on their position. In this
paper, we investigate various aspects of $\Z_N$ rank-2 gauge theory in
${(2+1)}$-dimensional spacetime. Firstly, we demonstrate that $U(1)$ rank-2
gauge theory can arise from ${U(1)\times U(1)}$ rank-1 gauge theory after
condensing the gauge charges in a specific way. This construction scheme of
$U(1)$ rank-2 gauge theory carries over to the $\Z_N$ case simply by Higgsing
$U(1)$ to $\Z_N$, after which the resulting rank-2 gauge theory can be tuned to
the R2TC. The holonomy operators of R2TC are readily identified using this
scheme and are given clear physical interpretation as the pair
creation/annihilation of various monopoles and dipoles. Explicit tensor network
construction of the ground states of R2TC are given as two copies of the ground
states of Kitaev's toric code that are `sewn together' according to the
condensation scheme. In addition, through a similar anyon condensation
protocol, we present a double semion version of rank-2 toric code whose flux
excitations exhibit restricted mobility and semionic statistics. Finally, we
identify the generalized discrete symmetries of the R2TC, which are much more
complex than typical 1-form symmetries. They include conventional and
unconventional 1-form symmetries, such as framed 1-form symmetries and what we
call sublattice 1-form symmetries. Using these, we interpret the R2TC's unique
properties (UV/IR mixing, position-dependent braiding, etc.) from the modern
perspective of generalized spontaneous symmetry breaking and 't Hooft
anomalies.

<h3>Decoding Structure-Spectrum Relationships with Physically Organized  Latent Spaces</h3>

<br>
<br>
A new semi-supervised machine learning method for the discovery of
structure-spectrum relationships is developed and demonstrated using the
specific example of interpreting X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
spectra. This method constructs a one-to-one mapping between individual
structure descriptors and spectral trends. Specifically, an adversarial
autoencoder is augmented with a novel rank constraint (RankAAE). The RankAAE
methodology produces a continuous and interpretable latent space, where each
dimension can track an individual structure descriptor. As a part of this
process, the model provides a robust and quantitative measure of the
structure-spectrum relationship by decoupling intertwined spectral
contributions from multiple structural characteristics. This makes it ideal for
spectral interpretation and the discovery of new descriptors. The capability of
this procedure is showcased by considering five local structure descriptors and
a database of over fifty thousand simulated XANES spectra across eight
first-row transition metal oxide families. The resulting structure-spectrum
relationships not only reproduce known trends in the literature, but also
reveal unintuitive ones that are visually indiscernible in large data sets. The
results suggest that the RankAAE methodology has great potential to assist
researchers to interpret complex scientific data, test physical hypotheses, and
reveal new patterns that extend scientific insight.

When the first four spectral moments are considered, spectral features
missing in standard Kohn-Sham (KS) density-functional theory (DFT), such as
upper and lower Hubbard bands, as well as spectral satellite peaks, can be
described, and the bandwidths can be corrected. Therefore, we have devised a
\textit{moment-functional based spectral density functional theory} (MFbSDFT)
recently. However, many computational tools in theoretical solid state physics,
such as the construction of maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs), have
been developed for KS-DFT and require modifications if they are supposed to be
used in MFbSDFT. Here, we show how generalized Wannier functions may be
constructed from the first four spectral moment matrices. We call these
functions \textit{maximally localized spectral moment Wannier functions}
(MLSMWFs). We demonstrate how MLSMWFs may be used to compute the anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) in fcc Ni by Wannier interpolation. More generally, MLSMWFs may be
computed from the first $2P$ moments ($P=1,2,3,\dots$). Using more than 4
moments opens the perspective of reproducing all spectral features accurately
in MFbSDFT.

<h3>Charge transfer due to defects in hexagonal boron nitride/graphene  heterostructures: an ab initio study</h3>

<i>Madhava Krishna Prasad, Oras A. Al-Ani, Jonathan P. Goss, Jonathan D. Mar</i>
<br>
<br>
Using density functional theory (DFT), we study charge transfer between
hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) point defects and graphene in h-BN/graphene
heterostructures for a range of intrinsic defects -- nitrogen vacancy, boron
vacancy, nitrogen antisite and boron antisite. We show that traditional methods
that calculate charge transfer by spatial discrimination of charge to different
atoms suffer from the misallocation of charge and introduce an alternative
method that relies on the integration of the density of states. We also show
that DFT calculations of charge transfer have cell size dependencies due to a
change in the density of states in the vicinity of the defect levels. Our
results indicate that the nitrogen and boron anitsites do not participate in
charge transfer, whereas the nitrogen and boron vacancies experience the
transfer of a whole electron. Additionally, we show that a change in the
geometry of a defect corresponds to a change in the charge state of the defect.
The results of our study will be invaluable for a wide variety of device
applications that involve charge transfer between h-BN defects and graphene in
h-BN/graphene heterostructures, while our methodology can be feasibly extended
to a wide range of point defects and heterostructures.

Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity through thermally
driven charge transport in solids, or vice versa for cooling. To be competitive
with conventional energy-generation technologies, a thermoelectric material
must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal
insulator. However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of
the interconnection of the scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and
phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub-device scales have revealed
that silicon membranes covered by nanopillars exhibit a multitude of local
phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the
heat-carrying phonons in the membrane and collectively cause a reduction in the
in-plane thermal conductivity$-$while, in principle, not affecting the
electrical properties because the nanopillars are external to the pathway of
voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated
experimentally for the first time by investigating device-scale suspended
silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars
cause up to 21 % reduction in the thermal conductivity while the electrical
conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient remain unaffected, thus demonstrating
an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.
The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and
corresponding lattice-dynamics calculations provide further evidence that the
reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding
breaks a longstanding trade-off between competing properties in
thermoelectricity and paves the way for engineered high-efficiency solid-state
energy recovery and cooling.

<h3>Quantum critical phase of FeO spans conditions of Earth's lower mantle</h3>

Earth's interior consists primarily of an insulating rocky mantle and a
metallic iron-dominant core. Recent work has shown that mountain-scale
structures at the core-mantle boundary may be highly enriched in FeO reported
to exhibit high conductivity and metallic behavior at extreme
pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions. However, the underlying electronic
processes in FeO remain poorly understood and controversial. Here we
systematically explore the electronic structure of B1-FeO at extreme conditions
with large-scale theoretical modeling using state-of-the-art embedded dynamical
mean field theory (eDMFT). Fine sampling of the phase diagram at more than 350
volume-temperature conditions reveals that, instead of sharp metallization,
compression of FeO at high temperatures induces a gradual orbitally selective
insulator-metal transition. Specifically, at P-T conditions of the lower
mantle, FeO exists in an intermediate "quantum critical" state, characteristic
of strongly correlated electronic matter. Transport in this regime, distinct
from insulating or metallic behavior, is marked by incoherent diffusion of
electrons in the conducting t_{2g} orbital and a band gap in the e_g orbital,
resulting in moderate electrical conductivity (~ 10^5 S/m) with modest P -T
dependence as observed in experiments. FeO-rich regions in Earth's lowermost
mantle could thus influence electromagnetic interactions between the mantle and
the core, producing several features observed in Earth's rotation and magnetic
field evolution.

The paramagnetic spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ has attracted
significant attention because of its exotic superconducting properties
including an extremely high upper critical field and possible chiral
superconducting states. Recently, ultraclean single crystals of UTe$_2$ have
become available, and thus measurements on these crystals are crucial to
elucidate the intrinsic superconducting properties. Here, we report the
thermodynamic critical field $H_{\rm c}$, the lower critical field $H_{\rm
c1}$, and the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ at low fields of these
high-quality single crystals. From the comparison of the anisotropies in
$H_{\rm c1}$ and $H_{\rm c2}$, we find that the experimental $H_{\rm c1}$
values with the magnetic field along $b$- and $c$-axes are anomalously
enhanced, showing unusual low-temperature upturns. We propose an effect of the
strong Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations on the vortex line energy as the
origin of the anisotropic enhancement of $H_{\rm c1}$.

Primary crystallization in high Al-content metallic glasses is driven by
nanometer-diameter regions with internal structure similar to fcc Al.
Comparison of fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) data to FEM simulations of
fcc Al clusters dispersed in a dense-random packed matrix is used to extract
the diameter and volume fraction of the ordered regions in a Al88Y7Fe5 base
glass and in glasses with 1 at.% Cu substituted for Y or Al. The size and
density of nanocrystals were measured as a function of isothermal annealing
time for the same alloys. The volume fraction of crystalline material grows
under isothermal annealing, so the phase transformation is not purely grain
coarsening, but the crystalline volume fraction is lower than the volume
fraction of ordered regions in the as-quenched samples, so not all of the
ordered regions act as nuclei. Changes in diameter and volume fraction of the
ordered regions with alloying are correlated with changes in the
crystallization temperature, nucleation rate, and nanocrystal density. No
evidence for phase separation is observed, and FEM simulations from a molecular
dynamics quenched structural model of similar composition do not show the
features observed in experiment.

<h3>On the Application of Non-Gaussian Noise in Stochastic Langevin  Simulations</h3>

<br>
<br>
In light of recent advances in time step independent stochastic integrators
for Langevin equations, we revisit the considerations for using non-Gaussian
distributions for the thermal noise term in discrete-time thermostats. We find
that the desirable time step invariance of the modern methods is rooted in the
Gaussian noise, and that deviations from this distribution will distort the
Boltzmann statistics arising from the fluctuation-dissipation balance of the
integrators. We use the GJ methods as the focus of our investigation since
these methods are the ones that contain the most accurate thermodynamic
measures of existing methods. Within this set of methods we find that any
distribution of applied noise which satisfies the two first moments given by
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, will result in correct, time step
independent results that are generated by the first two moments of the system
coordinates. However, if non-Gaussian noise is applied, undesired deviations in
higher moments of the system coordinates will appear to the detriment of
several important thermodynamic measures that depend especially on the fourth
moments. The deviations, induced by non-Gaussian noise, become significant with
the one time step attenuation, thereby inhibiting the benefits of the methods.
Thus, we conclude that the application of Gaussian noise is necessary for
reliable thermodynamic results when using modern stochastic thermostats with
large time steps.

<br>
<br>
We developed a cryogenic temperature deposition process for high-performance
CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) on 300 mm thermally oxidized
silicon wafers. The effect of the deposition temperature of the CoFeB layers on
the nanostructure, magnetic and magneto-transport properties of the MTJs were
investigated in detail. When CoFeB was deposited at 100 K, the MTJs exhibited a
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of 214 uJ/m2 and a voltage-controlled
magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) coefficient of -45 fJ/Vm, corresponding to 1.4- and
1.7-fold enhancements in PMA and VCMA, respectively, compared to the case of
room-temperature deposition of CoFeB. The improvement in the MTJ properties was
not simply due to the morphology of the MTJ films. The interface-sensitive
magneto-transport properties indicated that interfacial qualities such as
intermixing and oxidation states at the MgO/CoFeB interfaces were improved by
the cryogenic temperature deposition. Cryogenic-temperature sputtering
deposition is expected to be a standard manufacturing process for
next-generation magnetoresistive random-access memory.

The thermal equation of states for fcc iridium (Ir) is obtained from
first-principles molecular dynamics up to 3000 K and 540 GPa. The equation of
state (EoS) is globally fitted to a simplified free energy model and various
parameters are derived. The theoretical principal Hugoniot is compared with
shockwave experiments, where discrepancy suggests formation of new Ir phases. A
few representative EoS parameters, such as bulk modulus $K_T$, thermal

<h3>Optical response of Higgs mode in superconductors at clean limit:  formulation through Eilenberger equation and Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04832" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04832</a>
<br>
<i>F. Yang, M. W. Wu</i>
<br>
<br>
Both macroscopic Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian and microscopic gauge-invariant
kinetic equation suggest a finite Higgs-mode generation in the second-order
optical response of superconductors at clean limit, whereas the previous
derivations through the path-integral approach and Eilenberger equation within
the Matsubara formalism failed to give such generation. The crucial treatment
leading to this controversy lies at an artificial scheme that whether the
external optical frequency is taken as continuous variable or bosonic Matsubara
frequency to handle the gap dynamics within the Matsubara formalism. To resolve
this issue, we derive the effective action of the superconducting gap near
$T_c$ in the presence of the vector potential through the path-integral
approach, to fill the long missing blank of the microscopic derivation of the
Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian in superconductors. It is shown that only by taking
optical frequency as continuous variable within the Matsubara formalism, can
one achieve the fundamental Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian, and in particular, the
finite Ginzburg-Landau kinetic term leads to a finite Higgs-mode generation at
clean limit. To further eliminate the confusion of the Matsubara frequency
through a separate framework, we apply the Eilenberger equation within the
Keldysh formalism, which is totally irrelevant to the Matsubara space. By
calculating the gap dynamics in the second-order response, it is analytically
proved that the involved optical frequency is a continuous variable rather than
bosonic Matsubara frequency, causing a finite Higgs-mode generation at clean
limit.

<br>
<br>
In order to provide the best possible performance, modern infrared
photodetector designs necessitate extremely precise modeling of the
superlattice absorber region. We advance the Rode's method for the Boltzmann
transport equation in conjunction with the $\bf k.p$ band structure and the
envelope function approximation for a detailed computation of the carrier
mobility and conductivity of layered type-II superlattice structures, using
which, we unravel two crucial insights. First, the significance of both elastic
and inelastic scattering mechanisms, particularly the influence of the
interface roughness and polar optical phonon scattering mechanisms in
technologically relevant superlattice structures. Second, that the
structure-specific Hall mobility and Hall scattering factor reveals that
temperature and carrier concentrations significantly affect the Hall scattering
factor, which deviates significantly from unity even for small magnetic fields.
This reinforces the caution that should be exercised when employing the Hall
scattering factor in experimental estimations of drift mobilities and carrier
concentrations. Our research hence offers a comprehensive microscopic
understanding of carrier dynamics in such technologically relevant
superlattices. Our models also provide highly accurate and precise transport
parameters beyond the relaxation time approximation and thereby paving the way
to develop physics-based device modules for mid-wavelength infrared
photodetectors.

<br>
<br>
We report the magnetic and electronic transport properties of the inversion
and time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl semimetal NdAlGe. This material is
analogous to NdAlSi, whose helical magnetism presents a rare example of a
Weyl-mediated collective phenomenon, but with a larger spin-orbit coupling. Our
neutron diffraction experiments revealed that NdAlGe, similar to NdAlSi,
supports an incommensurate Ising spin density wave ($T_{\text{inc}}=6.8$ K)
with a small helical spin canting of 3$^\circ$ and a long-wavelength of $\sim$
35 nm, which transitions to a commensurate ferrimagnetic state below
$T_{\text{com}}=5.1$ K. Using small-angle neutron scattering, we showed that
the zero-field cooled ferrimagnetic domains form stripes in real space with
characteristic length scales of 18 nm and 72 nm parallel and perpendicular to
the [110] direction, respectively. Interestingly, for the transport properties,
NdAlSi does not exhibit an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that is commonly
observed in magnetic Weyl semimetals. In contrast to NdAlSi, we identify two
different AHE regimes in NdAlGe that are respectively governed by intrinsic
Berry curvature and extrinsic disorders/spin fluctuations. Our study suggests
that Weyl-mediated magnetism prevails in this group of noncentrosymmetric
magnetic Weyl semimetals NdAl$X$, but transport properties including AHE are
affected by material-specific extrinsic effects such as disorders, despite the
presence of prominent Berry curvature.

We report a broadband study of the charge dynamics in the van der Waals (vdW)
magnetic materials 2H-$M_x$TaS$_2$ ($M$ = Mn and Co), which span the onset of
both long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) order, depending
on the intercalation $M$ and its concentration $x$. We discover a spectral
weight ($SW$) shift from high to low energy scales for FM compositions, while
reversely $SW$ is removed from low towards high spectral energies for AFM
compounds. This maps the related reconstruction of the electronic band
structure along the crossover from the FM to AFM order, which restores an
occupation balance in the density of states between spin majority and minority
bands of the intercalated 3$d$ elements.

<h3>Universality of neural dynamics on complex networks</h3>

This paper discusses the capacity of graph neural networks to learn the
functional form of ordinary differential equations that govern dynamics on
complex networks. We propose necessary elements for such a problem, namely,
inductive biases, a neural network architecture and a learning task.
Statistical learning theory suggests that generalisation power of neural
networks relies on independence and identical distribution (i.i.d.)\ of
training and testing data. Although this assumption together with an
appropriate neural architecture and a learning mechanism is sufficient for
accurate out-of-sample predictions of dynamics such as, e.g.\ mass-action
kinetics, by studying the out-of-distribution generalisation in the case of
diffusion dynamics, we find that the neural network model: (i) has a
generalisation capacity that depends on the first moment of the initial value
data distribution; (ii) learns the non-dissipative nature of dynamics
implicitly; and (iii) the model's accuracy resolution limit is of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ for a system of size $n$.

<h3>Dynamics of Fluctuating Thin Sheets Under Random Forcing</h3>

We study the dynamic structure factor of fluctuating elastic thin sheets
subject to conservative (athermal) random forcing. In Steinbock, Katzav &
Boudaoud, Phys. Rev. Research 4, 033096 (2022), the static structure factor of
a such a sheet was studied. In this paper, we recap the model developed there
and investigate its dynamic properties. Using the self-consistent expansion
(SCE), the time dependent two-point function of the height profile is
determined and found to decay exponentially in time. Despite strong nonlinear
coupling, the decay rate of the dynamic structure factor is found to coincide
with the effective coupling constant for the static properties which suggests
that the model under investigation exhibits certain quasi-linear behaviour.
Confirmation of these results by numerical simulations is also presented.

Coulomb correlations between the electrons imprint characteristic signatures
to the spectral properties of materials. Among others, they are at the origin
of a rich phenomenology of satellite features, either stemming from atomic-like
multiplets or from interactions with particle-hole excitations or plasmons.
While in many cases the latter lie at considerably higher energies than the
former, suggesting clear distinction criteria, this picture has recently become
blurred by indications that satellites of different types can coexist in the
same energy range. It is now generally accepted that the identification of the
nature of spectral features is a highly non-trivial task. In this article we
propose a general procedure for tracing the origin of satellites of different
types within modern ab initio calculations. As an illustration, we analyze the
ternary transition metal oxides SrVO$_3$ and SrMoO$_3$, which are drosophila
compounds for the coexistence of Hubbard and plasmonic satellites, reconciling
previous seemingly contradictory findings in an unexpected manner.

The phase field crystal (PFC) model describes crystal lattices at diffusive
timescales. In its amplitude expansion (APFC), it can be applied to the
investigation of relatively large systems under some approximations. However,
crystal symmetries accessible within this method are limited to basic ones,
namely triangular and square in two dimensions, and body-centered cubic and
face-centered cubic in three dimensions. In this work, we propose a general
description of virtually any lattice symmetry within the APFC model. To fully
exploit the advantages of this model, featuring slowly-varying quantities in
bulk and localized significant variations at dislocations and interfaces, we
consider formulations suitable for real-space numerical methods. We explore
approaches originally proposed for the PFC model which allow for symmetries
beyond basic ones through extended parametrizations. Moreover, we tackle the
modeling of non-Bravais lattices by introducing an amplitude expansion for
lattices with a basis and further generalizations. We study and discuss the
stability of selected, prototypical lattice symmetries. As pivotal examples, we
show that the proposed approach allows for a coarse-grained description of the
kagome lattice, exotic square arrangements, and the diamond lattice, as bulk
crystals and, importantly, hosting dislocations.

Spin-waves (magnons) are among the prime candidates for building fast yet
energy-efficient platforms for information transport and computing. We here
demonstrate theoretically and in state-of-the-art micromagnetic simulation the
effects that strategically-injected spin-polarized current can have on
controlling magnonic transport. We reveal analytically that the Zhang-Li
spin-transfer-torque induced by applied current is analogous to the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for scattering the magnons in the linear
regime, to then provide a generalized Snell's law that describes the spin-wave
propagation across regions with different current densities. We validate the
latter in numerical simulations of realistic systems, and exemplify how these
findings may help advance the design of spin-wave logic and neuromorphic
computing devices.

We investigate the synchronization transition of the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model
on networks of the fruit-fly and two large human connectomes. This model
contains a force term, thus is capable of describing critical behavior in the
presence of external excitation. By numerical solution we determine the
crackling noise durations with and without thermal noise and show extended
non-universal scaling tails characterized by $2< \tau_t < 2.8$, in contrast
with the Hopf transition of the Kuramoto model, without the force
$\tau_t=3.1(1)$. Comparing the phase and frequency order parameters we find
different transition points and fluctuations peaks as in case of the Kuramoto
model. Using the local order parameter values we also determine the Hurst
(phase) and $\beta$ (frequency) exponents and compare them with recent
experimental results obtained by fMRI. We show that these exponents,
characterizing the auto-correlations are smaller in the excited system than in
the resting state and exhibit module dependence.

Ferromagnetic (Fe or Fe20Ni80) and antiferromagnetic (NiO) phases were
deformed by high pressure torsion, a severe plastic deformation technique, to
manufacture bulk sized nanocomposites and demonstrate an exchange bias, which
has been reported predominantly for bilayer thin films. High pressure torsion
deformation at elevated temperatures proved to be the key to obtain homogeneous
bulk nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction investigations detected
nanocrystallinity of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases.
Furthermore, an additional phase was identified by X-ray diffraction, which
formed during deformation at elevated temperatures through the reduction of NiO
by Fe. Depending on the initial powder composition of Fe50NiO50 or
Fe10Ni40NiO50 the new phase was magnetite or maghemite, respectively.
Magnetometry measurements demonstrated an exchange bias in the high pressure
torsion processed bulk nanocomposites. Additionally, a tailoring of magnetic
parameters was demonstrated by the application of different strains or
post-process annealing. A correlation between the amount of applied strain and
exchange bias was found. The increase of exchange bias through applied strain
was related to the microstructural refinement of the nanocomposite. The
nanocrystalline maghemite was considered to have a crucial impact on the
observed changes of exchange bias through applied strain.

We systematically consider the KMgX family (X = P, As, and Sb) of materials
and investigate the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on thermal and
electrical transport properties using a combined first-principles and Boltzmann
transport equation approach. It is found that so far unexplored ternary
quasi-two-dimensional KMgSb is particularly promising with SOC having a strong
effect, shifting its behaviour from a p-type to n-type thermoelectric material.
The transport properties of KMgSb were studied under the application of
hydrostatic pressure. Our calculations show that Bi doping in KMgSb may prove
to be a game changer as the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) becomes
ultra-low, thereby increasing the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) by
$>280~\%$ with SOC and by $>345~\%$ without SOC. Through our computational
investigation, we explain that the SOC plays a critical role and establish that
alloy engineering may improve thermoelectric performance dramatically.

Here we report the first investigation on correlation between the transport
properties and the corresponding stability of the lattice structure for
CaK(Fe1-xNix)4As4 (x=0.04 and 0), a new type of putative topological
superconductors, with and without a spin-vortex crystal (SVC) state in a wide
pressure range involving superconducting to non-superconducting transition and
the half- to full-collapse of tetragonal (h-cT and f-cT) phases, by the
complementary measurements of high-pressure resistance, Hall coefficient and
synchrotron X-ray diffraction. We identify the three critical pressures, P1
that is the turn-on critical pressure of the h-cT phase transition and it
coincides with the critical pressure for the sign change of Hall coefficient
from positive to negative, a manifestation of the Fermi surface reconstruction,
P2 that is the turn-off pressures of the h-cT phase transition, and P3 that is
the critical pressure of the f-cT phase transition. By comparing the
high-pressure results measured from the two kinds of samples, we find a
distinct left-shift of the P1 for the doped sample, at the pressure of which
its SVC state is fully suppressed, however the P2 and the P3 remain the same as
that of the undoped one. Our results not only provide a consistent
understanding on the results reported before, but also demonstrate the
importance of the Fe-As bonding in stabilizing the superconductivity of the
iron pnictide superconductors through the pressure window.

High-entropy oxides (HEOs), as a new family of materials with five or more
principal cations, have shown promising properties for various applications. In
this work and inspired by inherent defective and strained structure of HEOs,
photocatalytic CO2 conversion is examined on a dual-phase TiZrNbHfTaO11
synthesized by a two-step high-pressure torsion mechanical alloying and
high-temperature oxidation. The HEO, which had various structural defects,
showed simultaneous photocatalytic activity for CO2 to CO and H2O to H2
conversion without the addition of a co-catalyst. The photocatalytic activity
of this HEO for CO2 conversion was better than conventional photocatalysts such
as anatase TiO2 and BiVO4 and similar to P25 TiO2. The high activity of HEO was
discussed in terms of lattice defects, lattice strain, light absorbance, band
structure, photocurrent generation and charge carrier mobility to activation
centers. The current study confirms the high potential of HEOs as a new family
of photocatalysts for CO2 conversion.

Magnesium and its alloys are the most investigated materials for solid-state
hydrogen storage in the form of metal hydrides, but there are still unresolved
problems with the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation of this group of materials. Severe plastic deformation (SPD)
methods, such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP), high-pressure torsion
(HPT), intensive rolling and fast forging, have been widely used to enhance the
activation, air resistance, and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics of
Mg-based hydrogen storage materials by introducing ultrafine/nanoscale grains
and crystal lattice defects. These severely deformed materials, particularly in
the presence of alloying additives or second-phase nanoparticles, can show not
only fast hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics but also good cycling
stability. It was shown that some materials that are apparently inert to
hydrogen can absorb hydrogen after SPD processing. Moreover, the SPD methods
were effectively used for hydrogen binding-energy engineering and synthesizing
new magnesium alloys with low thermodynamic stability for reversible
low/room-temperature hydrogen storage, such as nanoglasses, high-entropy
alloys, and metastable phases including the high-pressure {\gamma}-MgH2
polymorph. This article reviews recent advances in the development of Mg-based
hydrogen storage materials by SPD processing and discusses their potential in

<h3>Self-Assembly of Soot Nanoparticles on the Surface of Resistively Heated  Carbon Microtubes in Near-Hexagonal Arrays of Micropyramids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Almost regular hexagonal arrays of a few micrometers tall and wide
micropyramids consisting of soot nano-particles are formed on the surface of
graphitized hollow filaments, which are resistively heated to
~1800$^\circ$C-2400$^\circ$C in an Ar atmosphere containing trace amounts of
oxygen (~300 p.p.m.). At the higher temperatures (T>2300$^\circ$C,
approximately) the soot particles are represented mainly by multi-shell carbon
nano-onions. The height and the width of the pyramids is strongly dependent on
the temperature of the resistive heating, diminishing from 5-10mkm at
T=1800$^\circ$C to 1mkm at 2300-2400$^\circ$C. Quasi-hexagonal arrays of the
micropyramids are organized in the convex ``craters'' on the surface of the
microtubes, which grow with the time of the thermal treatment. The pyramids are
pointing always normally to the surface of the craters, except at the
boundaries between the craters, where the normal direction is not well defined.
The pyramids are soft and can be easy destroyed by touching them, but can be
hardened by heating them in the oxygen-free atmosphere. The pyramids are
observed only on the exterior surface of the microtubes, but not on their inner
surface. This suggests that the thermophoretic force generated by a strong
temperature gradient near the external surface of the tubes may be the cause of
the micropyramids formation. Electrostatic charging of the soot nanoparticles
due to thermionic emission may also be relevant to this phenomenon. The
micropyramids can function as field emission point sources, as demonstrated
with the use of a micro-nanoprobing station, mounted in a scanning electron
microscope.

<h3>Exchange interaction for Mn acceptor in GaAs: revealing its strong  deformation dependence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05038" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05038</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In this paper we calculate exchange interaction constant between manganese
ion inner electronic $d$-shell and GaAs valence band bounded hole using their
microscopic multiparticle wave functions. We reveal its parametric dependence
on crystal lattice deformations and find out that it could be about and even
more than dozens percent when the strain tensor reaches values of $10^{-3} \div
10^{-2}$. This fact is in accordance with the previous hypothesis of
deformation dependence of Mn acceptors in GaAs fine energy structure obtained
from Raman spectroscopy, and we show that this dependence has the same
magnitude. Also, we resolve here the problem of a substantial high temperature
mismatch between well-developed theory and experimental data for the static
magnetic susceptibility of Mn ions in GaAs. We show by numerical estimates and
calculations that quite a strong parametric dependence of the exchange coupling
value on GaAs lattice expansion determines the high temperature (above $50~$K)
magnetic susceptibility reduction as well.

<h3>Pattern Description of Quantum Phase Transitions in the Transverse  Antiferromagnetic Ising Model with a Longitudinal Field</h3>

<br>
<br>
Despite of simplicity of the transverse antiferromagnetic Ising model with a
uniform longitudinal field, its phases and involved quntum phase transitions
(QPTs) are nontrivial in comparison to its ferromagnetic counterpart. For
example, what is the nature of the mixed-order in such a model and does there
exist a disorder phase? Here we use a pattern picture to explore the
competitions between the antiferromagnetic Ising interaction, the transverse
and longitudinal fields and uncover what kind of pattern takes responsibility
of these three competing energy scales, thus determine the possible phases and
their QPTs or crossovers. Our results not only unveil rich physics of this
paradigmatic model, but also further stimulate quantum simulation by using
current available experimental platforms.

<h3>Spin-tensor Meissner currents of ultracold bosonic gas in an optical  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05054" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05054</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaofan Zhou, Xi-Wang Luo, Suotang Jia</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the Meissner currents of interacting bosons subjected to a
staggered artificial gauge field in a three-leg ribbon geometry, realized by
spin-tensor--momentum coupled spin-1 atoms in an 1D optical lattice. By
calculating the current distributions using the state-of-art density-matrix
renormalization-group method, we find a rich phase diagram containing
interesting Meissner and vortex phases, where the currents are mirror symmetric
with respect to the mid leg (i.e., they flow in the same direction on the two
boundary legs opposite to that on the mid leg), leading to the spin-tensor type
Meissner currents, which is very different from previously observed chiral edge
currents under uniform gauge field. The currents are uniform along each leg in
the Meissner phase and form vortex-antivortex pairs in the vortex phase.
Besides, the system also support a polarized phase that spontaneously breaks
the mirror symmetry, whose ground states are degenerate with currents either
uniform or forming vortex-antivortex pairs. We also discuss the experimental
schemes for probing these phases. Our work provides useful guidance to ongoing
experimental research on synthetic flux ribbons and paves the way for exploring
novel many-body phenomena therein.

<h3>Finite-size excess-entropy scaling for simple liquids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05063" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05063</a>
<br>
<i>Mauricio Sevilla, Atreyee Banerjee, Robinson Cortes-Huerto</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce and validate a finite-size two-body excess entropy integral
equation. By using analytical arguments and computer simulations of
prototypical simple liquids, we show that the excess entropy $s_2$ exhibits a
finite-size scaling with the inverse of the linear size of the simulation box.
Since the self-diffusivity coefficient $D^*$ displays a similar finite-size
effect, we show that the scaling entropy relation $D^*=A\exp(\alpha s_2)$ also
depends on the simulation box size. By extrapolating to the thermodynamic
limit, we report values for the coefficients $A$ and $\alpha$ that agree well
with values available in the literature. Finally, we find a power law relation
between the scaling coefficients for $D^*$ and $s_2$, suggesting a constant
viscosity to entropy ratio.

<h3>Inelastic Neutron Scattering Study of the Spin Dynamics in the Breathing  Pyrochlore System LiGa0.95In0.05Cr4O8</h3>

<br>
<br>
The A-site ordered chromate spinels LiGa1-xInxCr4O8 host a network of
size-alternating spin-3/2 Cr3+ tetrahedra known as a 'breathing' pyrochlore
lattice. For the x=0.05 composition, the complex magneto-structural ordering
observed in the parent x=0 material is replaced by a single transition at Tf=11
K, ascribed to the collinear nematic order caused by strong spin-lattice
coupling. We present here an inelastic neutron scattering study of the spin
dynamics in this composition. Above Tf , the dynamical scattering function
S(Q,E) is ungapped and quasi-elastic, similar to undoped LiGaCr4O8. Below Tf ,
the spectral weight splits between a broad inelastic feature at 5.8 meV and
toward the elastic line. The former feature can be ascribed to spin precessions
within antiferromagnetic loops, lifted to finite energy by the effective
biquadratic spin-lattice term in the spin Hamiltonian.

<br>
<i>Chiara Pezzotti, Massimiliano Giona</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a general stochastic formalism for describing the evolution of
chemical reactions involving a finite number of molecules. This approach is
consistent with the statistical analysis based on the Chemical Master Equation,
and provides the formal setting for the existing algorithmic approaches
(Gillespie algorithm). Some practical advantages of this formulation are
addressed, and several examples are discussed pointing out the connection with
quantum transitions (radiative interactions).

<br>
<br>
The superconducting diode effect (SDE) has attracted growing interest in
recent years as it potentially enables dissipationless and directional charge
transport for applications in superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we
demonstrate a materials-agnostic and magnetic-field-free approach based on
four-terminal Josephson junctions (JJs) to engineer a superconducting diode
with a record-high efficiency (~ 100%). We show that the SDE is reconfigurable
by applying control currents to different terminals. We attribute the observed
SDE to the asymmetry of the effective current-phase relation (CPR), which we
derive from a circuit-network model. Our findings demonstrate the emergence of
a new form of the CPR in multi-terminal JJs that can emulate macroscopic
transport signatures of superconducting systems with broken inversion and
time-reversal symmetries.

<i>Stefan Ernst, Patrick J. Scheidegger, Simon Diesch, Luca Lorenzelli, Christian L. Degen</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on measurements of the photoluminescence (PL) properties of single
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond at temperatures between 4-300 K. We
observe a strong reduction of the PL intensity and spin contrast between ca.
10-100 K that recovers to high levels below and above. Further, we find a rich
dependence on magnetic bias field and crystal strain. We develop a
comprehensive model based on spin mixing and orbital hopping in the electronic
excited state that quantitatively explains the observations. Beyond a more
complete understanding of the excited-state dynamics, our work provides a novel
approach for probing electron-phonon interactions and a predictive tool for
optimizing experimental conditions for quantum applications.

<br>
<br>
Using wide-band (0.5-6.5 eV) spectroscopic ellipsometry we study ultrathin
[Bi(0.6-2.5 nm)-FeNi(0.8,1.2 nm)]N multilayer films grown by rf sputtering
deposition, where the FeNi layer has a nanoisland structure and its morphology
and magnetic properties change with decreasing the nominal layer thickness.
From the multilayer model simulations of the ellipsometric angles, Psi(omega)
and Delta(omega), the complex (pseudo)dielectric function spectra of the Bi
layer were extracted. The obtained results demonstrate that the Bi layer can
possess the surface metallic conductivity, which is strongly affected by the
morphology and magnetic properties of the nanoisland FeNi layer in the GMR-type
Bi-FeNi multilayer structures.

<h3>Type II multiferroic order in two-dimensional transition metal halides  from first principles spin-spiral calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05107" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05107</a>
<br>
<i>Joachim Sødequist, Thomas Olsen</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a computational search for spin spiral ground states in
two-dimensional transition metal halides that are experimentally known as van
der Waals bonded bulk materials. Such spin spirals break the rotational
symmetry of the lattice and lead to polar ground states where the axis of
polarization is strongly coupled to the magnetic order (type II multiferroics).
We apply the generalized Bloch theorem in conjunction with non-collinear
density functional theory calculations to find the spiralling vector that
minimizes the energy and then include spin-orbit coupling to calculate the
preferred orientation of the spin plane with respect to the spiral vector. We
find a wide variety of magnetic orders ranging from ferromagnetic, stripy
anti-ferromagnetic, 120$^\circ$ non-collinear structures and incommensurate
spin spirals. The latter two introduce polar axes and are found in the majority
of materials considered here. The spontaneous polarization is calculated for
the incommensurate spin spirals by performing full supercell relaxation
including spinorbit coupling and the induced polarization is shown to be
strongly dependent on the orientation of the spiral planes. We also test the
effect of Hubbard corrections on the results and find that for most materials
LDA+U results agree qualitatively with LDA. An exception is the Mn halides,
which are found to exhibit incommensurate spin spiral ground states if Hubbard
corrections are included whereas bare LDA yields a 120$^\circ$ non-collinear
ground state.

<h3>Phonon-assisted optical absorption of SiC polytypes from first  principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05110" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05110</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao Zhang, Emmanouil Kioupakis</i>
<br>
<br>
Silicon carbide (SiC) is an indirect-gap semiconductor material widely used
in electronic and optoelectronic applications. While experimental measurements
of the phonon-assisted absorption coefficient of SiC across its indirect gap
have existed for more than fifty years, theoretical investigations of
phonon-assisted absorption have been hampered by their excessive computational
cost. In this work, we calculate the phonon-assisted temperature-dependent
optical absorption spectra of the commonly occurring SiC polytypes (3C, 2H, 4H
and 6H), using first-principles approaches based on density functional theory
and related techniques. We show that our results agree with experimentally
determined absorption coefficients in the spectral region between the direct
and indirect band gaps. The temperature dependence of the spectra can be
well-predicted with taking the temperature-dependence of the band gaps into
account. Lastly, we compare the spectra obtained with second-order perturbation
theory to those determined by the special displacement method, and we show that
the full consideration of the electronic energy renormalization due to
temperature is important to further improve the prediction of the
phonon-assisted absorption in SiC. Our insights can be applied to predict the
optical spectra of the less common SiC polytypes and other indirect-gap
semiconductors in general.

<h3>Spin-orbital order and excitons in magnetoresistive HoBi</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetism of the rock-salt $fcc$ rare-earth monopnictide HoBi, a
candidate topological material with extreme magnetoresistance, is investigated.
From the Ho$^{3+}$ non-Kramers $J$=8 spin-orbital multiplet, the cubic crystal
electric field yields six nearly degenerate low-energy levels. These constitute
an anisotropic magnetic moment with a Jahn-Teller-like coupling to the lattice.
In the cubic phase for $T>T_N~=~5.72(1)~K$, the paramagnetic neutron scattering
is centered at $\mathbf{k}=(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ and was fit to
dominant antiferromagnetic interactions between Ho spins separated by $\{100\}$
and ferromagnetic interactions between spins displaced by
$\{\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. For $T<T_N$, a type-II AFM long-range order with
$\mathbf{k}=(\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2})$ develops along with a
tetragonal lattice distortion. While neutron diffraction from a multi-domain
sample cannot unambiguously determine the spin orientation within a domain, the
bulk magnetization, structural distortion, and our measurements of the magnetic
excitations all show the easy axis coincides with the tetragonal axis. The
weakly dispersive excitons for $T<T_N$ can be accounted for by a spin
Hamiltonian that includes the crystal electric field and exchange interactions
within the Random Phase Approximation.

<h3>Debye temperature, electron-phonon coupling constant, and moderate  nonadiabaticity in highly-compressed I-43d-TaH3 superconductor</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recently, He et al (arXiv2212.13739 (2022)) reported on the discovery of
high-temperature superconductivity in highly-compressed polyhydride of
tantalum. At pressure ${\it P}=197 GPa$, the polyhydride I-43d-phase of $TaH_3$
exhibits zero-resistance transition temperature $T_{c,zero}=25.6 K$.
Measurements of the low-temperature magnetoresistance showed that this
superconductor has the ground state upper critical field (defined by the zero
resistance criterion) $B_{c2}(0) = 11 Tesla$. Here, we performed detailed
analysis of the reported experimental data by He et al (arXiv2212.13739 (2022))
and deduced several parameters of the I-43d-phase of $TaH_3$: (a) the Debye
temperature, $T_{\theta}=263 K$, (b) the electron-phonon coupling constant,
${\lambda}_{e-ph}=1.53$; (c) the Fermi temperature $T_{F}=1324 K$; (d) the
strength of nonadiabaticity, $T_{\theta}/T_F =0.19$; (e) and the ratio of
$T_{c}/T_{F} =0.0185 $ which implies that I-43d-phase of $TaH_3$ falls in
unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot. Deduced parameters
indicate that the I-43d-phase of $TaH_3$ (${\it P}=197 GPa$) can be classified
as typical unconventional high-temperature superconductor.

<h3>Electronic Kapitza resistance and related kinetic coefficients at an  interface between n-type semiconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>A. P. Meilakhs</i>
<br>
<br>
We calculate the Kapitza conductance, which is the proportionality
coefficient between heat flux and temperature jump at the interface, for two
electronic subsystems separated by the interface. We observe that for
electronic subsystems in a non-equilibrium state, there should also arise the
electrochemical potential jump at the interface. Hence to describe linear
transport at the interface we need three kinetic coefficients: interfacial
analogs of electric and heat conductances and interfacial analog of the Seebeck
coefficient. We calculate these coefficients for the interface between n-type
semiconductors. We have found out that the interfacial analog of the Seebeck
coefficient for some range of parameters of the considered semiconductors, has
a high value of about $10^{-3} $ V/K. Thus this effect has the potential to be
used for the synthesis of effective thermoelectric materials.

<br>
A complete framework for exciting and detecting thermally-induced, stabilized
sine-Gordon breathers in ac-driven long Josephson junctions is developed. The
formation of long-time stable breathers locked to the ac source occurs for a
sufficiently high temperature. The latter emerges as a powerful control
parameter, allowing for the remarkably stable localized modes to appear.
Nonmonotonic behaviors of both the breather generation probability and the
energy spatial correlations versus the thermal noise strength are found. The
junction's resistive switching characteristics provides a clear experimental
signature of the breather.

<h3>Energetics of point defects in yttrium aluminum garnet doped with Mg and  Si</h3>

<i>L. Yu. Kravchenko, D. V. Fil</i>
<br>
<br>
An influence of Mg and Si dopants on the formation energies and the
concentration of point defects in yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) is studied
using the density functional approach. The formation energies of Mg and Si
substitutional and interstitial defects, native point defects and defect
complexes versus the oxygen chemical potential are obtained. It is shown that
in YAG doped with Mg, negatively charged Mg substitutional defects are
compensated by free carriers (holes) and positively charged oxygen vacancies,
whereas interstitial Mg ions play a minor role. The concentration of oxygen
vacancies increases under an increase in the concentration of Mg ions. In YAG
doped with Si, positively charged Si substitutional defects are compensated by
negatively changed isolated cation vacancies and complexes of Si ions and
cation vacancies. Under an increase in the concentration of Si ions most of Al
and Y vacancies bind in complexes with Si ions. As a result, the concentration
of isolated cation vacancies depends nonmonotonically on the concentration of
Si ions. The maximum of the concentration of isolated cation vacancies is
reached at $0.02 - 0.04$ at. \% of Si, depending on sintering conditions. Mg -
Si complexes have very low formation energies. Due to formation of such
complexes, Si and Mg increases the solubility of each other in YAG. At the same
time Mg - Si complexes do not influence the concentration of anion and cation
vacancies. The overall concentration of vacancies in YAG codoped with Mg and Si
in equal atomic concentrations is low. At an excess concentration of Si or Mg
the concentration of vacancies increases by orders of magnitude.

<br>
<br>
As a highly frustrated model Hamiltonian with an exact dimer ground state,
the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple leaf lattice is of high theoretical
interest, and a material realization is intensely sought after. We determine
the magnetic Hamiltonian of the copper mineral bluebellite using density
functional theory based energy mapping. As a consequence of the significant
distortion of the spin $S=1/2$ maple leaf lattice, we find two of the five
distinct nearest neighbor couplings to be ferromagnetic. Solution of this
Hamiltonian with density matrix renormalization group calculations points us to
the surprising insight that this particular imperfect maple leaf lattice, due
to the strongly ferromagnetic Cu$^{2+}$ dimer, realizes an effective $S=1$
breathing kagome Hamiltonian. In fact, this is another highly interesting
Hamiltonian which has rarely been realized in materials. Analysis of the
effective model within a bond-operator formalism allows us to identify a
valence bond solid ground state and to extract thermodynamic quantities using a
low-energy bosonic mean-field theory. We resolve the puzzle of the apparent
one-dimensional character of bluebellite as our calculated specific heat has a
Bonner-Fisher-like shape, in good agreement with experiment.

<br>
Using two-frequency driving in two dimensions opens up new possibilites for
Floquet engineering, which range from controlling specific symmetries to tuning
the properties of resonant gaps. In this work, we study two-band lattice models
subject to two-tone Floquet driving and analyse the resulting effective Floquet
bandstructures both numerically and analytically. On the one hand, we extend
the methodology of Sandholzer et al. [10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.013056] from
one to two dimensions and find competing topological phases in a simple Bravais
lattice when the two resonant drives at $1\omega$ and $2\omega$ interfere. On
the other hand, we explore driving-induced symmetry breaking in the hexagonal
lattice, in which the breaking of either inversion or time-reversal symmetry
can be tuned independently via the Floquet modulation. Possible applications of
our work include a simpler generation of topological bands for ultracold atoms,
and the realisation of non-linear Hall effects as well as Haldane's parity
anomaly in inversion-symmetric parent lattices.
