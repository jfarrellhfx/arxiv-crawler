<h3>Active learning strategies for atomic cluster expansion models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08716" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08716</a>

The atomic cluster expansion (ACE) was proposed recently as a new class of
data-driven interatomic potentials with a formally complete basis set. Since
the development of any interatomic potential requires a careful selection of
training data and thorough validation, an automation of the construction of the
training dataset as well as an indication of a model's uncertainty are highly
desirable. In this work, we compare the performance of two approaches for
uncertainty indication of ACE models based on the D-optimality criterion and
ensemble learning. While both approaches show comparable predictions, the
extrapolation grade based on the D-optimality (MaxVol algorithm) is more
computationally efficient. In addition, the extrapolation grade indicator
enables an active exploration of new structures, opening the way to the
automated discovery of rare-event configurations. We demonstrate that active
learning is also applicable to explore local atomic environments from
large-scale MD simulations.

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) are a
large family of materials actively studied for various applications, especially
in the field of energy storage. MXenes are commonly synthesized by etching the
layered ternary compounds, MAX phases. We demonstrate a direct synthetic route
for scalable and atom-economic synthesis of MXenes, including phases that have
not been synthesized from MAX phases, by the reactions of metals and metal
halides with graphite, methane, or nitrogen. The direct synthesis enables
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of MXene carpets and complex
spherulite-like morphologies that form through buckling and release of MXene
carpet to expose fresh surface for further reaction. The directly synthesized
MXenes showed excellent energy storage capacity for Li-ion intercalation.

<h3>Configurational temperature in active matter. II. Quantifying the  deviation from thermal equilibrium</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09041" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09041</a>
<br>
<i>Shibu Saw, Lorenzo Costigliola, Jeppe C. Dyre</i>

This paper suggests using the configurational temperature $\Tc$ for
quantifying how far a given active-matter system is from thermal equilibrium.
We measure this ``distance'' by the ratio of the systemic temperature $\Ts$ to
$\Tc$, where $\Ts$ is the canonical-ensemble temperature leading to the same
average potential energy as that of the active-matter system. $\Tc$ is
determined by the local variation of the potential-energy function, while $\Ts$
is a global quantity. The quantity $\Ts/\Tc$ is easy to evaluate in a computer
simulation; equilibrium simulations in conjunction with a single steady-state
active-matter configuration are enough to determine $\Ts/\Tc$. We validate the
suggestion that $\Ts/\Tc$ quantifies the deviation from equilibrium by data for
the radial distribution function of 3d Kob-Andersen and 2d Yukawa active-matter
models with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and active Brownian Particle dynamics.
The ratio $\Ts/\Tc$, structure, and dynamics of the homogeneous phase, are all
approximately constant along the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS)
boundary in the phase diagram of the 2d Yukawa model. This confirms that
$\Ts/\Tc$ measures the degree of deviation from thermal equilibrium, which is
expected to be constant along the MIPS phase boundary. The proposed measure is
not limited to active matter and can be used for quantifying how far any system
involving a potential-energy function, e.g., a driven Hamiltonian system, is
from thermal equilibrium.

<h3>Narrow escape in composite domains forming heterogeneous networks</h3>

Cellular networks are often composed of thin tubules connecting much larger
node compartments. These structures serve for active or diffusion transport of
proteins. Examples are glial networks in the brain, the endoplasmic reticulum
in cells or dendritic spines located on dendrites. In this latter case, a large
ball forming the head is connected by a narrow passage. In all cases, how the
transport of molecules, ions or proteins is regulated determines the time scale
of chemical reactions or signal transduction. In the present study, based on
modeling diffusion in three dimensions, we compute the mean time for a Brownian
particle to reach a narrow target inside such a composite network made of
tubules connected to spherical nodes. We derive asymptotic formulas by solving
a mixed Neumann-Dirichlet boundary value problem with small Dirichlet part. We
first consider the case of a network domain organized in a 2-D lattice
structure that consists of spherical ball compartments connected via narrow
cylindrical passages. When there is a single target we derive a matrix equation
for each Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) averaged over each spherical
compartment. We then consider a composite domain consisting of a spherical
head-like domain connected to a large cylinder via a narrow cylindrical neck.
For Brownian particles starting within the narrow neck, we derive formulas for
the MFPT to reach a target on the spherical head. When diffusing particles can
be absorbed upon hitting additional absorbing boundaries of the large cylinder,
we compute the probability and conditional MFPT to reach a target. We compare
these formulas with numerical solutions of the mixed boundary value problem and
with Brownian simulations. To conclude, the present analysis reveals that the
mean arrival time, driven by diffusion in heterogeneous networks, is controlled
by the target and narrow passage sizes.

<h3>Unraveling on Kinesin Acceleration in Intracellular Environments: A  Theory for Active Bath</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09430" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09430</a>
<br>
<i>Mengkai Feng, Zhonghuai Hou</i>
<br>
<br>
Single molecular motor kinesin harnesses thermal and non-thermal fluctuations
to transport various cargoes along microtubules, converting chemical energy to
directed movements. To describe the non-thermal fluctuations generated by the
complex environment in living cells, we establish a bottom-up model to mimic
the intracellular environment, by introducing an active bath consisting of
active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) particles. Simulations of the model system show
that kinesin and the probe attached to it are accelerated by such active bath.
Further, we provide a theoretical insight into the simulation result by
deriving a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the probe with a mean-field
method, wherein an effective friction kernel and fluctuating noise terms are
obtained explicitly. Numerical solutions of the GLE show very good agreement
with simulation results. We sample such noises, calculate their variances and
non-Gaussian parameters, and reveal that the dominant contribution to probe
acceleration is attributed to noise variance.

<h3>Drying of Bio-colloidal Sessile Droplets: Advances, Applications, and  Perspectives</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09610" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09610</a>

Drying of biologically-relevant sessile droplets, including passive systems
(like DNA and proteins), as well as active microbial systems comprising
bacteria and algae, have garnered considerable attention over the last decades.
Distinct morphological patterns emerge when bio-colloids undergo drying, with
significant potential in a range of biomedical applications, spanning
bio-sensing, medical diagnostics, drug delivery, and antimicrobial resistance.
This review presents a comprehensive overview of bio-colloidal droplets drying
on solid substrates, focusing on the experimental progress during the last ten
years. We provide a summary of the relevant properties of bio-colloids and link
their composition (constituent particles, solvent, and concentrations) to the
patterns emerging due to drying. We examined the drying patterns generated by
passive bio-colloids (DNA, globular, fibrous, and composite proteins, plasma,
serum, blood, urine, tears, saliva). This article highlights how morphological
patterns are influenced by the nature of the biological entities and the
solvent, micro- and global environmental conditions. Correlations between
emergent patterns and the initial droplet compositions enable the detection of
potential clinical abnormalities when compared with the patterns of drying
droplets of healthy control samples, offering a diagnostic blueprint. Recent
experimental investigations of pattern formation in the bio-mimetic and
salivary drying droplets, relevant to COVID-19 are also presented. Finally, we
summarize the role of biologically active agents in drying process, including
bacteria and algae during the drying process. The review concludes with a
perspective on the next generation of research and applications based on drying
droplets, enabling potential innovations and tools to study this exciting
interface of physics, biology, data sciences, and machine learning.

<h3>Noncommutative Field Theory of the Tkachenko Mode: Symmetries and Decay  Rate</h3>

We construct an effective field theory describing the collective Tkachenko
oscillation mode of a vortex lattice in a two-dimensional rotating
Bose-Einstein condensate in the long-wavelength regime. The theory has the form
of a noncommutative field theory of a Nambu-Goldstone boson, which exhibits a
noncommutative version of dipole symmetry. From the effective field theory, we
show that, at zero temperature, the decay width $\Gamma$ of the Tkachenko mode
scales with its energy $E$ as $\Gamma\sim E^3$ in the low-energy limit. We also
discuss the width of the Tkachenko mode at a small temperature.

<h3>Torsional Instabilities in the Delamination of Soft Adhesives</h3>

Soft adhesive contacts are ubiquitous in nature and are increasingly used in
synthetic systems, such as flexible electronics and soft robots, due to their
advantages over traditional joining techniques. While methods to study the
failure of adhesives typically apply tensile loads to the adhesive joint, less
is known about the performance of soft adhesives under shear and torsion, which
may become important in engineering applications. A major challenge that has
hindered the characterization of shear/torsion-induced delamination is imposed
by the fact that, even after delamination, contact with the substrate is
maintained, thus allowing for frictional sliding and re-adhesion. In this work,
we address this gap by studying the controlled delamination of soft cylinders
under combined compression and torsion. Our experimental observations expose
the nucleation of delamination at an imperfection and its propagation along the
circumference of the cylinder. The observed sequence of `stick-slip' events and
the sensitivity of the delamination process to material parameters are
explained by a theoretical model that captures axisymmetric delamination
patterns, along with the subsequent frictional sliding and re-adhesion. By
opening up an avenue for improved characterization of adhesive failure, our
experimental approach and theoretical framework can guide the design of
adhesives in future applications.

<h3>Evaluating Stage Motion for Automated Electron Microscopy</h3>

Precise control is an essential and elusive quality of emerging self-driving
microscopes. It is widely understood these instruments must be capable of
performing rapid, high-volume, and arbitrary movements for practical
self-driving operation. However, stage movements are difficult to automate at
scale, owing to mechanical instability, hysteresis, and thermal drift. Such
difficulties pose major barriers to intelligent microscope designs that require
repeatable, precise movements. To guide design of emerging instruments, it is
necessary to understand the behavior of existing designs to identify rate
limiting steps for full autonomy. Here we describe a general framework to
evaluate stage motion in any electron microscope. We define metrics to evaluate
stage degrees of freedom, propose solutions to improve performance, and comment
on fundamental limits to automated experimentation using present hardware.

<h3>Drude weights in one-dimensional systems with a single defect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08711</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Ballistic transport of a quantum system can be characterized by Drude weight,
which quantifies the response of the system to a uniform electric field in the
infinitely long timescale. The Drude weight is often discussed in terms of the
Kohn formula, which gives the Drude weight by the derivative of the energy
eigenvalue of a finite-size system with the periodic boundary condition in
terms of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. Recently, the Kohn formula is generalized to
nonlinear responses. However, the nonlinear Drude weight determined by the Kohn
formula often diverges in the thermodynamic limit. In order to elucidate the
issue, in this work we examine a simple example of a one-dimensional
tight-binding model in the presence of a single defect at zero temperature. We
find that its linear and non-linear Drude weights given by the Kohn formula (i)
depend on the Aharonov-Bohm flux and (ii) diverge proportionally to a power of
the system size. We argue that the problem can be attributed to different order
of limits. The Drude weight according to the Kohn formula (``Kohn--Drude
weight'') indicates the response of a finite-size system to an adiabatic
insertion of the Aharonov-Bohm flux. While it is a well-defined physical
quantity for a finite-size system, its thermodynamic limit does not always
describe the ballistic transport of the bulk. The latter should be rather
characterized by a ``bulk Drude weight'' defined by taking the thermodynamic
limit first before the zero-frequency limit. While the potential issue of the
order of limits has been sometimes discussed within the linear response, the
discrepancy between the two limits is amplified in nonlinear Drude weights. We
demonstrate the importance of the low-energy excitations of $O(1/L)$, which are
excluded from the Kohn--Drude weight, in regularizing the bulk Drude weight.

<h3>Electronic Density of States of a $U\left(1\right)$ Quantum Spin Liquid  with Spinon Fermi Surface. I. Orbital Magnetic Field Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08767</a>
<br>
<i>Wen-Yu He, Patrick. A. Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
Quantum spin liquid (QSL) with spinon Fermi surface is an exotic insulator
that hosts neutral Fermi surfaces inside the gap. In an external magnetic
field, it has been pointed out that the neutral Fermi surfaces are Landau
quantized to form Landau levels (LLs) due to the induced emergent gauge
magnetic field. In this work, we calculate the electronic density of states
(DOS) of the QSL in an orbital magnetic field. We find that the LLs from the
neutral Fermi surfaces give rise to a set of steps emerging at the upper and
lower Hubbard band edges. Each of the Hubbard band edge steps further develop
into a band edge resonance peak when a weak gauge binding from the gauge field
fluctuations is taken into account. Importantly, each Hubbard band edge step
and its resulting resonance peak in the weak gauge binding are found to have a
correspondence LL from the neutral Fermi surfaces, so the Hubbard band edge
steps and the band edge resonance peaks are the unique features that
characterize the Landau quantization of the in-gap neutral Fermi surfaces. We
further consider the strong gauge binding regime where the band edge resonance
peaks move into the Mott gap and develop into true in-gap bound states. In the
strong gauge binding regime, we solve the bound state LL spectrum. For the
bound state with a Mexican hat like band dispersion, we find that the envelop
energy to have a state excited from the bound state LL decreases quadratically
with the magnetic field. The quadratic decrease behavior of the envelop energy
is consistent with the intuition that applying magnetic field localizes the
states and energetically promotes the in-gap bound states formation. Finally,
we connect our results to the electronic DOS spectra measured in the layered
1T-TaS$_2$. We point out that a QSL with a quasi-bound state in the upper
Hubbard band can give the DOS spectra similar to the one measured in the
experiment.

<h3>Electronic Density of States of a $U\left(1\right)$ Quantum Spin Liquid  with Spinon Fermi Surface. II. Zeeman Magnetic Field Effects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08768" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08768</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The Zeeman effect lowers the energy of electrons with spin states which are
anti-parallel to the applied magnetic field but lifts that of spin parallel
states. In quantum spin liquids where the spin and charge degrees of freedom
are fractionalized, anomalous Zeeman response may be expected. In the case of
spin liquids with spinon Fermi surface, the threshold energy to excite an
electronic state is found to exhibit no Zeeman shift. This is specific to the
spinon Fermi surface case. In contrast, other gapped spin liquids are expected
to exhibit the standard Zeeman shift at the band edge even though they also
exhibit spin-charge fractionalization. When gauge field fluctuations are
included, we find that the Zeeman shift of the electronic states gets affected
by the gauge field induced binding. In the electronic density of states
spectra, weak gauge binding induces band edge resonance peaks which exhibit the
Zeeman shift in the same direction as that in the standard Zeeman effect, but
the shift is reduced as the binding potential increases. With further increase
in the binding potential the resonance becomes true in-gap bound states and
eventually the shift direction reverses so it is opposite to the standard
Zeeman effect. We propose that one can perform spin polarized scanning
tunneling microscope measurements as a test of the spinon Fermi sea ground
state in quantum spin liquid candidate materials.

<h3>Spin and electronic excitations in 4f atomic chains on Au(111)  substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08772</a>
<br>
<i>David W. Facemyer, Naveen K. Dandu, Vijay R. Singh, Anh T. Ngo, Sergio E. Ulloa</i>
<br>
<br>
High spin systems, like those that incorporate rare earth 4f elements (REEs),
are increasingly relevant in many fields. Although research in such systems is
sparse, the large Hilbert spaces they occupy are promising for many
applications. In this work, we examine a one-dimensional linear array of
europium (Eu) atoms on a Au(111) surface and study their electronic and
magnetic excitations. Ab initio calculations using VASP with PBE+U, spin-orbit
coupling, and the HSE hybrid functional are employed to study the structure. We
find Eu atoms to have a net charge when on gold, consistent with a net magnetic
momemt of $\simeq 3.5 \mu_B$. Examining various spin-projection configurations,
we can evaluate first and second neighbor exchange energies in an isotropic
Heisenberg model between spin-$\frac{7}{2}$ moments to obtain $J_1 \approx -0.9
\, \mathrm{K}$ and $J_2 \approx 4.3 \, \mathrm{K}$ for the relaxed-chain atomic
separation of $a \approx 5 \;\r{A}$. These parameters are used to obtain the
full spin excitation spectrum of a physically realizable four-atom chain. The
large $J_2/|J_1|\simeq 4.8$ ratio results in a singlet ground state with
dimer-like antiferromagnetic correlations between second neighbors. The
seemingly small $J_1$ values significantly affect the spectra, underscoring the
important role that nearest-neighbor coupling plays in this system, including
possible Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Spin-flip excitations are
calculated to extract differential conductance profiles as those obtained by
scanning tunneling microscopy techniques. We uncover interesting behavior for
local higher spin excitations, especially as we track their dispersion with
applied magnetic fields.

<h3>Coarse-grained dynamics of transiently-bound fast linkers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08777" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08777</a>
<br>
<i>Sophie Marbach, Christopher E. Miles</i>
<br>
<br>
Transient bonds between fast linkers and slower particles are widespread in
physical and biological systems. In spite of their diverse structure and
function, a commonality is that the linkers diffuse on timescales much faster
compared to the overall motion of the particles they bind to. This limits
numerical and theoretical approaches that need to resolve these diverse
timescales with high accuracy. Many models, therefore, resort to effective, yet
ad-hoc, dynamics, where linker motion is only accounted for when bound. This
paper provides a mathematical justification for such coarse-grained dynamics
that preserves detailed balance at equilibrium. Our derivation is based on
multiscale averaging techniques and is broadly applicable. We verify our
results with simulations on a minimal model of fast linker binding to a slow
particle. We show how our framework can be applied to various systems,
including those with multiple linkers, stiffening linkers upon binding, or slip
bonds with force-dependent unbinding. Importantly, the preservation of detailed
balance only sets the ratio of the binding to the unbinding rates, but it does
not constrain the detailed expression of binding kinetics. We conclude by
discussing how various choices of binding kinetics may affect macroscopic
dynamics.

<h3>Zero-field miniature skyrmion crystal and chiral domain state in  breathing-kagome antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08778" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08778</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The stability of a miniature skyrmion crystal (SkX) with only a small number
of spins in the magnetic unit cell has been theoretically investigated in
$J_1$-$J_3$ antiferromagnets on the breathing kagome lattice with a single-ion
anisotropy $D$ at zero field. It is found by means of Monte Carlo simulations
that due to the breathing bond-alternation, a zero-field triple-${\bf Q}$
miniature SkX can be stabilized not only in the specific case of $D=0$ [K.
Aoyama and H. Kawamura, Phys. Rev. B 105, L100407 (2022)] but also in more
realistic situations with easy-axis ($D<0$) and easy-plane ($D>0$) anisotropies
which favor triple-${\bf Q}$ collinear and noncoplanar states, respectively.
Since the SkX and anti-SkX each having positive or negative chirality are
energetically degenerate, the topological Hall effect of alternative sign is
possible at zero field. It is also found that reflecting the chiral degeneracy,
the collinear and coplanar phases preempting the SkX phase possess random
domain structures consisting of positive- and negative-chirality clusters.

A Rossby-Haurwitz (RH) wave is an excitation mode of a fluid on a rotating
spherical surface, which propagates westward in the rotating frame of
reference. Motivated by the recent realization of the shell-shaped
Bose-Einstein condensate in microgravity, we investigate the RH wave in a
superfluid rotating on a spherical-surface geometry. We employ the point-vortex
model and the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and numerically
demonstrate that RH waves can be observed in the system of a superfluid with
quantized vortices.

The study of the charge excitations in cuprates is presently an interesting
topic because of the development of new and precise x-ray experiments. Based on
a large-$N$ formulation of the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, which allows us
to consider all possible charge excitations on an equal footing, we investigate
the charge spectrum for both electron- and hole-doped cases. In both cases, the
instability toward phase separation, which has momentum modulation ${\bf
q}=(0,0)$, is found to be robust in a large region of the doping-temperature
phase diagram. If a short-range Coulomb repulsion is included the phase
separation region shrinks, but the instability remains at ${\bf q}=(0,0)$. If
on the other hand a two-dimensional long-range Coulomb interaction is included
the instability sets in at ${\bf q}$ momenta forming a ring around ${\bf
q}=(0,0)$. The computed charge spectrum in the translation-invariant phase
shows well-formed rings. We discuss our results in the light of recent x-ray
experiments in electron- and hole-doped cuprates, where ring-like shaped charge
modulations have been reported.

<h3>A unified state diagram for the yielding transition of soft colloids</h3>

Concentrated colloidal suspensions and emulsions are amorphous soft solids,
widespread in technological and industrial applications and studied as model
systems in physics and material sciences. They are easily fluidized by applying
a mechanical stress, undergoing a yielding transition that still lacks a
unified description. Here, we investigate yielding in three classes of
repulsive soft solids, using analytical and numerical modelling and experiments
probing the microscopic dynamics and mechanical response under oscillatory
shear. We find that at the microscopic level yielding consists in a transition
between two distinct dynamical states, which we rationalize by proposing a
lattice model with dynamical coupling between neighboring sites, leading to a
unified state diagram for yielding. Leveraging the analogy with Wan der Waals's
phase diagram for real gases, we show that distance from a critical point plays
a major role in the emergence of first-order-like vs second-order-like features
in yielding, thereby reconciling previously contrasting observations on the
nature of the transition.

<h3>A Thermodynamic Treatment\\ of Partially Saturated Soils \\ Revealing  the Structure of Effective Stress</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08868" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08868</a>

<i>Yimin Jiang, Itai Einav, Mario Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
A rigorous thermodynamic treatment of partially saturated soils is developed
using a minimal number of assumptions. The derivation is carried out in a way
that does not require to explicitly track the complex shapes of interfaces
between the solid, fluid and gas domains. Instead, suction is the property
being recovered explicitly through the minimisation of energy around an ideal
`suctionless limit', while considering the different compressibilities of the
three domains. In interpreting experimental data the derivation ensures the
thermodynamic equilibrium between the chemical potentials of the soil and
measurement cells, while carefully distinguishing intrinsic from measured
pressures and suctions. A most general expression for the effective stress of
partially saturated soils is then derived that is strictly linked to the
soil-water retention curve (SWRC). The structure of the effective stress
broadly depends on the three thermodynamic densities characterising the solid,
fluid and gas domains. Special cases of SWRC are explored, which reveals
conditions for which the structure of the effective stress may agree with
previously proposed empirical relationships.

We demonstrate that the topological hinge state can possess a nontrivial
optical Berry curvature in the nonAbelian formulation of the Berry curvature.
It can be readily probed by the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), with the
light illuminating a specific hinge, and we refer to it as the hinge CPGE. As a
concrete example, we calculate the hinge CPGE in ferromagnetic MnBi2nTe3n+1,
and find that the hinge CPGE peak structure well reflects the optical Berry
curvature of hinge states and the optical sum rule captures the optical Berry
curvature between the hinge state and the ground state. Thus, the hinge CPGE
provides a promising route towards the optical detection of the hinge state
geometrical structure.

KAgF$_3$ is a quasi one-dimensional quantum antiferromagnet hosting a series
of intriguing structural and magnetic transitions. Here we use powder neutron
diffraction, $\mu$SR spectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory calculations
to elucidate the low temperature magnetic phases. Below $T_{N1}=29$K we find
that the material orders as an A-type antiferromagnet with an ordered moment of
0.47$\mu_{\rm B}$. Both neutrons and muons provide evidence for an intermediate
phase at temperatures $T_{N1}<T<T_{N2}$ with $T_{N2}\approx 66$ K from a
previous magnetometry study. However, the evidence is at the limit of detection
and its nature remains an open problem.

We present a class of exactly solvable tri-junctions of one- and
two-dimensional spin systems. Based on the geometric criterion for solvability,
we clarify the sufficient condition for the junctions so that the spin
Hamiltonian becomes equivalent to Majorana quadratic forms. Then we examine
spin tri-junctions using the obtained solvable models. We consider the
transverse magnetic field Ising spin chains and reveal how Majorana zero modes
appear at the tri-junctions of the chains. Local terms of the tri-junction
crucially affect the appearance of Majorna zero modes, and the tri-junction may
support Majorana zero mode even if the bulk spin chains do not have Majorana
end states. We also examine tri-junctions of two-dimensional SO(5)-spin
lattices and discuss Majorana fermions along the junctions.

<br>
<br>
For layered materials, the interlayer stacking is a critical degree of
freedom tuning electronic properties, while its microscopic characterization
faces great challenges. The transition-metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$
represents a novel example, in which the stacking pattern is not only enriched
by the spontaneous occurrence of the intralayer charge density wave, but also
recognized as a key to understand the nature of the low-temperature insulating
phase. We exploit the $^{33}\rm{S}$ nuclei in a 1T-TaS$_2$ single crystal as
sensitive probes of the local stacking pattern via quadrupolar coupling to the
electron density distribution nearby, by combining nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) measurements with the state-of-the-art first-principles electric-field
gradient calculations. The applicability of our proposal is analyzed through
temperature, magnetic-field, and angle dependent NMR spectra. Systematic
simulations of a single 1T-TaS$_2$ layer, bilayers with different stacking
patterns, and typical stacking orders in three-dimensional (3D) structures
unravel distinct NMR characteristics. Particularly, one 3D structure achieves a
quantitative agreement with the experimental spectrum, which clearly
rationalizes the coexistence of two types of interfacial environments. Our
method may find general applications in the studies of layered materials.

<br>
<br>
The role of carbon in the formation of alpha boron at high pressure and high
temperature (HPHT) has been investigated by combining HPHT experiments and
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Starting from beta rhombohedral
or amorphous boron and amorphous carbon at 5 GPa, the alpha boron phase has
been repeatedly observed between 1473 K and 2273 K, at temperatures that are
much higher than those reported in the phase diagram of boron. The DFT
investigation of the effect of carbon insertion into the alpha rhombohedral
boron atomic structure on the formation enthalpy, volume and optical properties
shows that only the (B11C) substituted icosahedron defect accounts for the
slight volume contraction observed in {\alpha} boron. It is also compatible
with the observed red colour of {\alpha} boron crystals, and consistently has a
very low formation energy. Our calculations also provide a calibration tool to
evaluate the carbon concentration in the samples. Finally, the synthesis
temperature is found to be an easy means to tune the carbon concentration on
demand.

A Muon Spin Rotation ($\mu$+SR) study was conducted to investigate the
magnetic properties of SrCu2(BO3)2 (SCBO) as a function of
temperature/pressure. Measurements in zero field and transverse field confirm
the absence of long range magnetic order at high pressures and low
temperatures. These measurements suggest changes in the Cu spin fluctuations
characteristics above 21 kbar, consistent with the formation of a plaquette
phase as previously suggested by inelastic neutron scattering measurements.
SCBO is the only known realisation of the Shatry-Sutherland model, thus the
ground state mediating the dimer and antiferromagnetic phase is likekly to be a
plaquette state.

Room-temperature stabilization of skyrmions in magnetic multilayered systems
is the result of a fine balance between different magnetic interactions namely
symmetric and antisymmetric exchange, dipolar, perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy as well as, in most cases, Zeeman through an applied external field.
Such field-driven stabilization approach is not compatible with most of the
anticipated skyrmion based applications, e.g. skyrmion memories, logic or
neuromorphic computing which motivates a reduction or a cancellation of field
requirements. Here we present a method to stabilize at room-temperature and
zero-field, a densely packed skyrmion phase in ferromagnetic multilayers with
moderate number of repetitions. To this aim, we finely tune the multilayer
parameters to stabilize a dense skyrmion phase. Then, relying on the interlayer
electronic coupling to an adjacent bias magnetic layer with strong
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and uniform magnetization, we demonstrate the
stabilization of sub-60 nm diameter skyrmion at zero-field with adjustable
skyrmion density.

The exact thermodynamical solution for the equilibrium properties of the
single-file hard-disk fluid is used to study the limiting low- and
high-pressure behaviors analytically. In the low-pressure regime, exact third
and fourth virial coefficients are obtained, while the asymptotic equation of
state in the high-pressure regime is derived. In addition, two different
approximations to the equation of state, with different complexity levels, are
proposed, and an extensive assessment of their validity and practical
convenience versus the exact solution is carried out.

Massive Dirac fermions are low-energy electronic excitations characterized by
a hyperbolic band dispersion. They play a central role in several emerging
physical phenomena such as topological phase transitions, anomalous Hall
effects and superconductivity. This work demonstrates that massive Dirac
fermions can be controllably induced by lithographically patterning
superstructures of nanoscale holes in a graphene device. Their band dispersion
is systematically visualized using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
with nanoscale spatial resolution. A linear scaling of effective mass with
feature sizes is discovered, underlining the Dirac nature of the
superstructures. In situ electrostatic doping dramatically enhances the
effective hole mass and leads to the direct observation of an electronic band
gap that results in a peak-to-peak band separation of (0.64 $\pm$ 0.03) eV,
which is shown via first-principles calculations to be strongly renormalized by
carrier-induced screening. The presented methodology outlines a new approach
for band structure engineering guided by directly viewing structurally- and
electrically-tunable massive Dirac quasiparticles in lithographic
superstructures at the nanoscale.

<br>
The interplay between dimensionality and topology manifests in magnetism via
both exotic texture morphology and novel dynamics. A free magnetic skyrmion
exhibits the skyrmion Hall effect under electric currents. Once it is confined
in one-dimensional (1D) channels, the skyrmion Hall effect would be suppressed,
and the current-driven skyrmion speed should be boosted by the non-adiabatic
spin transfer torque \b{eta}. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that stripes
of a spatially modulated spin helix serve as natural 1D channels to restrict
skyrmion. Using FeGe as a benchmark, an interstitial skyrmion is created by
geometry notch and further moves steadily without the skyrmion Hall effect. The
slope of the current-velocity curve for 1D skyrmion is enhanced almost by an
order of magnitude owing to a large \b{eta} in FeGe. This feature is also
observed in other topological defects. Utilizing the 1D skyrmion dynamics would
be a highly promising route to implement topological spintronic devices.

<br>
<br>
Structural and compositional inhomogeneity is common in zeolites and
considerably affects their properties. Conventional transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) cannot provide sufficient information on local structures in
zeolites due to the thickness-limited lateral resolution, lack of depth
resolution, and electron dose-constrained focusing. We demonstrate that a
multislice ptychography method based on four-dimensional scanning TEM (4D-STEM)
data can overcome these limitations. The 4D-STEM ptychography image obtained
from a ~40-nm thick MFI zeolite exhibits an ultrahigh lateral resolution of
~0.85 {\AA}, enabling the unambiguous identification of individual framework
oxygen (O) atoms and the precise determination of the orientations of adsorbed
molecules. Furthermore, a depth resolution of ~6.6 nm is achieved, allowing the
three-dimensional probing of O vacancies and phase boundaries in zeolites. The
results of the 4D-STEM ptychography provide an unprecedented complete
understanding of the intergrowth of MFI and MEL zeolites in three dimensions.
The 4D-STEM ptychography can be generally applied to various zeolites and other
materials with similar electron beam sensitivity.

<h3>Electronic transport and thermoelectric properties of phosphorene  nanodisk under an electric field</h3>

<i>M. Amir Bazrafshan, Farhad Khoeini</i>
<br>
<br>
The Seebeck coefficient is an important quantity in determining the
thermoelectric efficiency of a material. Phosphorene is a two-dimensional
material with a puckered structure, which makes its properties anisotropic. In
this work, a phosphorene nanodisk (PDisk) with a radius of 3.1 nm connected to
two zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons is studied, numerically, by the
tight-binding (TB) and non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) methods in the
presence of transverse and perpendicular electric fields. Our results show that
the change of the structure from a zigzag ribbon form to a disk one creates an
energy gap in the structure, so that for a typical nanodisk with a radius of
3.1 nm, the size of the energy gap is 3.88 eV. Besides, with this change, the
maximum Seebeck coefficient increases from 1.54 to 2.03 mV/K. Furthermore, we
can control the electron transmission and Seebeck coefficients with the help of
the electric fields. The numerical results show that with the increase of the
electric field, the transmission coefficient decreases, and the Seebeck
coefficient changes. The effect of a perpendicular electric field on the
Seebeck coefficient is weaker than a transverse electric field. For an applied
transverse electric field of 0.3 V/nm, the maximum Seebeck coefficient enhances
to 2.09 mV/K.

Magnon eigenmodes in easy-plane antiferromagnetic insulators are linearly
polarized and are not expected to carry any net spin angular momentum.
Motivated by recent nonlocal spin transport experiments in the easy-plane phase
of hematite, we perform a series of large-scale micromagnetic simulations in a
nonlocal geometry at finite temperatures. We show that by tuning an external
magnetic field, we can control the magnon eigenmodes and the polarization of
the spin transport signal in these systems. We argue that a coherent beating
oscillation between two linearly polarized magnon eigenmodes is the mechanism
responsible for finite spin transport in easy-plane antiferromagnetic
insulators. The sign of the detected spin signal polarization is also naturally
explained by the proposed coherent beating mechanism.

The kagome ferromagnet, $\rm Co$-based shandite $\rm Co_{3}Sn_{2}S_{2}$,
shows a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) associated with the Weyl nodes. A
thin film with a $\rm Co$ kagome monolayer was predicted to exhibit the quantum
AHE, which awaits the experimental realization. However, since the Weyl nodes
are the topological singularities unique to bulk, it is unclear how they reside
while the film thickness is reduced. Moreover, it is challenging to precisely
predict the band topology of thin films where the lattice and electronic
structures are in general different from the bulk. Here we report the $ab \
initio$ results for thin films of $\rm Co_{3}Sn_{2}S_{2}$ with one, two and
three $\rm Co$ layers with $\rm Sn$ or $\rm S$ surface terminations, with
special attention to the optimization of lattice structure and magnetism. We
find that all the $\rm Sn$-end films stabilize a ferromagnetic state similar to
the bulk, and retain the large AHE down to the monolayer limit where the AHE is
quantized. In contrast, in the $\rm S$-end films, the magnetic state varies
with the number of $\rm Co$ layers, which drastically changes the topological
properties, including an interlayer antiferromagnetic state with zero AHE in
the bilayer case. Our results would stimulate further experimental exploration
of thin Weyl materials.

<h3>Realization of a three-dimensional quantum Hall effect in a  Zeeman-induced second order topological insulator on a torus</h3>

<i>Zhe Hou, Clara S. Weber, Dante M. Kennes, Daniel Loss, Herbert Schoeller, Jelena Klinovaja, Mikhail Pletyukhov</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a realization of a quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a second-order
topological insulator (SOTI) in three dimensions (3D), which is mediated by
hinge states on a torus surface. It results from the nontrivial interplay of
the material structure, Zeeman effect, and the surface curvature. In contrast
to the conventional 2D- and 3D-QHE, we show that the 3D-SOTI QHE is not
affected by orbital effects of the applied magnetic field and exists in the
presence of a Zeeman term only, induced e.g. by magnetic doping. To explain the
3D-SOTI QHE, we analyze the boundary charge for a 3D-SOTI and establish its
universal dependence on the Aharonov-Bohm flux threading through the torus
hole. Exploiting the fundamental relation between the boundary charge and the
Hall conductance, we demonstrate the universal quantization of the latter, as
well as its stability against random disorder potentials and continuous
deformations of the torus surface.

Topological states of matter possess bulk electronic structures categorized
by topological invariants and edge/surface states due to the bulk-boundary
correspondence. Topological materials hold great potential in the development
of dissipationless spintronics, information storage, and quantum computation,
particularly if combined with magnetic order intrinsically or extrinsically.
Here, we review the recent progress in the exploration of intrinsic magnetic
topological materials, including but not limited to magnetic topological
insulators, magnetic topological metals, and magnetic Weyl semimetals. We pay
special attention to their characteristic band features such as the gap of
topological surface state, gapped Dirac cone induced by magnetization (either
bulk or surface), Weyl nodal point/line, and Fermi arc, as well as the exotic
transport responses resulting from such band features. We conclude with a brief
envision for experimental explorations of new physics or effects by
incorporating other orders in intrinsic magnetic topological materials.

Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and DFT plus coherent potential
approximation (DFT+CPA) are employed to reveal, respectively, the effect of
in-plane strain and site-diagonal disorder on the electronic structure of cubic
boron arsenide (BAs). It is demonstrated that tensile strain and static
diagonal disorder both reduce the semiconducting one-particle band gap of BAs,
and a V-shaped p-band electronic state emerges -- enabling advanced
valleytronics based on strained and disordered semiconducting bulk crystals. At
biaxial tensile strains close to 15% the valence band lineshape relevant for
optoelectronics is shown to coincide with one reported for GaAs at low
energies. The role played by static disorder on the As sites is to promote
p-type conductivity in the unstrained BAs bulk crystal, consistent with
experimental observations. These findings illuminate the intricate and
interdependent changes in crystal structure and lattice disorder on the
electronic degrees of freedom of semiconductors and semimetals.

Quantum entanglement can provide enhanced precision beyond standard quantum
limit (SQL), the highest precision achievable with classical means. It remains
challenging, however, to observe large enhancement limited by the experimental
abilities to prepare, maintain, manipulate and detect entanglement. Here, we
present nonlinear interferometry protocols based on echoing spin-nematic
squeezing to achieve record high enhancement factors in atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate. The echo is realized by a state-flip of the spin-nematic squeezed
vacuum, which serves as the probe state and is refocused back to the vicinity
of the unsqueezed initial state while carrying out near noiseless amplification
of a signal encoded. A sensitivity of $21.6\pm0.5$ decibels (dB) for a
small-angle Rabi rotation beyond the two-mode SQL of 26400 atoms as well as
$16.6\pm1.3$ dB for phase sensing in a Ramsey interferometer are observed. The
absolute phase sensitivity for the latter extrapolates to
$103~\rm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at a probe volume of $18~\mu\rm{m}^3$ for near-resonant
microwave field sensing. Our work highlights the excellent many-body coherence
of spin-nematic squeezing and suggests its possible quantum metrological
applications in atomic magnetometer, atomic optical clock, and fundamental

Single-component ultracold atomic Fermi gases are usually described using
noninteracting many-fermion models. However, recent experiments reached a
regime where $p$-wave interactions among identical fermionic atoms are
important. In this article, we employ variational and fixed-node diffusion
Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the ground-state properties of
single-component Fermi gases with short-range repulsive interactions. We
determine the zero-temperature equation of state, and elucidate the roles
played by the $p$-wave scattering volume and the $p$-wave effective range. A
comparison against recently-derived second-order perturbative results shows
good agreement in a broad range of interaction strength. We also compute the
quasiparticle effective mass, and we confirm the perturbative prediction of a
linear contribution in the $p$-wave scattering volume, while we find
significant deviations from the beyond-mean-field perturbative result, already
for moderate interaction strengths. Finally, we determine ground-state energies
for two-component unpolarized Fermi gases with both interspecies and
intraspecies hard-sphere interactions, finding remarkable agreement with a
recently derived fourth-order expansion that includes $p$-wave contributions.

The nearly free electron metal next to a localized Mott insulating state has
been recently proposed as a way to probe Kondo lattice physics and to gain
insight into how the two extremes of localized and delocalized electron states
interact (Sunko, et al, Science advances 6, 2020). Although high harmonic
generation has been used extensively to investigate the gas phase, its
extension to solids is relatively recent, and has not yet been applied to
interfaces. Here, we investigate the field-induced dielectric break-down at the
Mott-insulator/metal interface using high harmonic generation, emitted when the
interface is subjected to an ultrafast laser pulse. We show that the intensity
of high harmonic emission correlates closely with doublon production and the
corresponding loss of short-range anti-ferromagnetic order. For strong
interlayer coupling, the harmonic intensity is defined by a phase transition
between states that do not exist in a pure Mott insulator case. For weak
interlayer coupling, the threshold for dielectric breakdown is considerably
lowered due to the presence of a metallic layer. This suggests that interlayer
coupling can be used as an additional knob to control magnetic insulator
break-down, with implications for using Mott insulators as memristors in
neuromorphic circuits.

When sand flows out of a funnel onto a surface, a three dimensional pile that
is stabilized by friction grows taller as it spreads. Here we investigate an
idealized two dimensional analogue: spreading of a pile of monodisperse oil
droplets at a boundary. In our system the droplets are buoyant, adhesive, and
in contrast to sand, here friction is negligible. The buoyant droplets are
added to the pile one-at-a-time. As the aggregate grows, it reaches a critical
height and the 2D pile spreads out across the barrier. We find that, while
granularity is important, the growth process is reminiscent of a continuum
liquid. We define a ``granular capillary length'', analogous to the capillary
length in liquids, which sets the critical height of the aggregate through a
balance of buoyancy and adhesion. At a coarse-grained level, the granular
capillary length is capable of describing both steady-state characteristics and
dynamic properties of the system, while at a granular level repeated collapsing
events play a critical role in the formation of the pile.

We consider partially directed walks crossing a $L\times L$ square weighted
according to their length by a fugacity $t$. The exact solution of this model
is computed in three different ways, depending on whether $t$ is less than,
equal to or greater than 1. In all cases a complete expression for the dominant
asymptotic behaviour of the partition function is calculated. The model admits
a dilute to dense phase transition, where for $0 < t < 1$ the partition
function scales exponentially in $L$ whereas for $t>1$ the partition function
scales exponentially in $L^2$, and when $t=1$ there is an intermediate scaling
which is exponential in $L \log{L}$.

We theoretically study the appearance of bound states around impurities in a
superconducting bilayer. We focus our attention on $s$-wave pairing, which
includes unconventional odd-parity states permitted by the layer degree of
freedom. Utilizing numerical mean-field and analytical $T$-matrix methods, we
survey the bound state spectrum produced by momentum-independent impurity
potentials in this model. For even-parity $s$-wave pairing bound states are
only found for impurities which break time-reversal symmetry. For odd-parity
$s$-wave states, in contrast, bound states are generically found for all
impurity potentials, and fall into six distinct categories. This categorization
remains valid for nodal gaps. Our results are conveniently understood in terms
of the ``superconducting fitness'' concept, and show an interplay between the
pair-breaking effects of the impurity and the normal-state band structure.

Nonreciprocal transport phenomena have attracted much attention in modern
condensed matter physics. In the field of superconductivity, the
superconducting diode effect (SDE) has been one of the central topics. Recent
theoretical studies for the SDE in intrinsic mechanism revealed the relation
between the SDE and helical superconductivity, for which experimental
clarification has been awaited. In this work, we establish a microscopic theory
of the intrinsic SDE in disordered systems. We show that the sign reversal of
the nonreciprocal critical current is suppressed under moderate impurity
concentrations. However, even in the moderately disordered region, the SDE
shows a feature signaling the change in the nature of helical
superconductivity. It is also found that the diode quality factor $r$ is
increased by disorders and reaches 20% in the Rashba-Zeeman model.

We use a semi-Markov processes method to calculate large deviations of
counting statistics for three open quantum systems, including a resonant
two-level system and resonant three-level systems in the $\Lambda$- and
$V$-configurations. In the first two systems, analytical solutions to the
scaled cumulant generating functions are obtained. We find that in these
systems, the large deviation rate functions at zero current are determined by
the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, while these functions have a
unified formula at large current.

<br>
<br>
The coherence length of two Majorana zero energy modes in a p-wave
topological superconductor is inversely proportional to the superconducting
order parameter. We studied the finite size effect of the Majorana zero modes
at vortices in a topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure in the
presence of a vortex and found that the the coherence length of the two zero
energy modes at the terminals of a vortex line is independent of
superconducting order parameter, and determined by the intrinsic properties of
the topological insulator. This anomalous property illustrates that the
superconducting topological insulator is topologically trivial, contrary to a
p-wave topological superconductor.

<br>
<br>
Using density functional theory (DFT), the structural, mechanical,
electronic, thermal, and optical properties of Hf2AB (A = Pb, Bi) borides were
studied, considering the pressure effect up to 50 GPa. The lattice constants
were found to be decreased with increasing pressure wherein the lattice
constants at 0 GPa agree well with the reported values. The stability
(mechanical and dynamical) of the titled compounds at different pressures was
checked. The mechanical behavior was disclosed considering the bulk modulus,
shear modulus, Youngs modulus, Pugh ratio, Poissons ratio, and hardness
parameter at different pressures. Pugh and Poisson ratios were used to assess
the brittleness and ductility of the titled borides. The anisotropic nature of
mechanical properties was studied by calculating different indices and plotting
2D and 3D projections of the elastic moduli. The electronic properties were
revealed by calculating the band structure, density of states, and charge
density mapping at different pressures, wherein the anisotropic nature of the
electronic conductivity was noted. We studied the Debye temperature, minimum
thermal conductivity, Gruneisen parameter, and melting temperature of the
titled borides at different pressures; the results revealed the improvement of
the mentioned properties with rising pressure. The important optical constants
to disclose the possible relevance in application purposes were investigated; a
little pressure effect was noted. The thermal properties suggest that the
titled borides could be used as thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials while
the reflectivity spectra revealed their suitability to be used as cover
materials for protection from solar heating.

<br>
<br>
We present a finite-size scaling theory of a contact process with permanent
immunity on uncorrelated scale-free networks. We model an epidemic outbreak by
an analog of the susceptible-infected-removed model where an infected
individual attacks only one susceptible in a time unit in a way we can expect a
non-vanishing critical threshold at scale-free networks. As we already know,
the susceptible-infected-removed model can be mapped in a bond percolation
process, allowing us to compare the critical behavior of site and bond
universality classes on networks. We used the external field finite-scale
theory, where the dependence on the finite size enters the external field
defined as the initial number of infected individuals. We can impose the scale
of the external field as $N^{-1}$. The system presents an epidemic-endemic
phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the mean-field universality
class, as we show theoretically and by simulations.

<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, for a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state, the electronic
occupation number for each Landau orbit could be obtained from numerical
methods such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group or
algebraic recursive schemes (Jack polynomial). In this work, we apply a
Metroplis Monte Carlo method to calculate the occupation numbers of several FQH
states in cylinder geometry. The convergent occupation numbers for more than 40
particles are used to verify the chiral bosonic edge theory and determine the
topological quantities via momentum polarization or dipole moment. The guiding
center spin, central charge and topological spin of different topological
sectors are consistent with theoretical values and other numerical studies.
Especially, we obtain the topological spin of $e/4$ quasihole in Moore-Read and
331 states. At last, we calculate the electron edge Green's functions and
analysis position dependence of the non-Fermi liquid behavior.

<h3>The entanglement entropy of the quantum Hall edge and its geometric  contribution</h3>

<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, the entanglement entropy (EE) between two subregions of a
gapped quantum many-body state is proportional to the area/length of their
interface due to the short range quantum correlation. However, the so-called
area law is violated logarithmically in a quantum critical phase. Moreover, the
subleading correction exists in a long range entangled topological phases. It
is referred to as topological EE which is related to the quantum dimension of
the collective excitation in the bulk. Further more, if a non-smooth sharp
angle is in the presence of the subsystem boundary, a universal angle dependent
geometric contribution is expected to appear in the subleading correction. In
this work, we simultaneously explore the geometric and edge contribution in the
integer quantum Hall (IQH) state and its edge reconstruction in a unified
bipartite method. Their scaling is found to be consistent with the conformal
field theory (CFT) predictions and recent results of the particle number
fluctuation calculations.

<br>
<br>
We analyse possible ways of calculating magnetic exchange interactions within
density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach
in paramagnetic phase. Using the susceptibilities within the ladder DMFT
approach together with the random phase approximation (RPA) result for the
Heisenberg model, we obtain bilinear exchange interactions. We show that the
earlier suggested result of [E. A. Stepanov, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121,
037204 (2018)] corresponds to the leading order approximation in the non-local
correlations. We apply the developed approach to evaluate effective magnetic
parameters of iron and nickel. For iron we find in the low-temperature limit
the exchange interaction $J_0\simeq 0.20$-$0.26$ eV. While the lower bound
allows to describe Curie temperature, the upper bound provides agreement with
the experimental spin-wave stiffness, the difference between these bounds is
attributed to the non-Heisenberg contributions. For nickel we obtain $J_0\simeq
1.2$ eV in a good agreement with the experimental data for spin-wave stiffness.

<h3>Manipulation of ferroelectric and magnetic properties properties of  single phase Bi4Ti3O12-3BiFeO3 solid solution through La substitution</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, the potential to exploit Aurivillius higher order composition
(n=6) given by Bi4Ti3O12-3BiFeO3 as single phase and high temperature
magnetoelectric materials are well explored by elaborately studying the
concerned structure and physical properties. Bi4Ti3O12-3Bi1-xLaxFeO3 (x=0,
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) was synthesized via solid-state reaction route and X-ray
diffraction data revealed that the lattice parameters associated with
orthorhombic cell (space group P21am) decrease with increase in La3+ content
confirming the incorporation of La. In the frequency dependent dielectric
measurements, the ferroelectric to paraelectric transition temperature (Tc)
corresponding to the parent (x=0) had two phase transitions vis., 803 K
(broader) and 983 K (sharper) whereas phase transitions are single that
progressively becomes sharper with increase in La substitution. Ferroelectric
switching behavior (polarization (P) versus electric field (E)) was
demonstrated for Bi4Ti3O12-3BiFeO3 and remnant polarization decreased
significantly for La substituted compositions reflecting weaker ferroelectric
ordering. In detailed Zero Field-cooled and Field cooled temperature dependent
magnetization measurements, Bi4Ti3O12-3BiFeO3 exhibited Tc around 296 K. Though
a marginal increase in the magnetization values for La substituted compositions
(x=0.1 and x=0.2), the overall temperature dependent magnetization curves
indicate overall paramagnetic nature. The results are more reflective of the
switching off of the possibilities of long range ferromagnetic ordering with
A-site rare earth doping in these Aurivillius layered compounds.

Quantum anomalous Hall insulators host topologically protected
dissipationless chiral edge states, the number of which is determined by its
Chern number. Up to now, the quantum anomalous Hall state has been realized in
a few magnetic topological insulators, but usually with a low Chern number.
Here, we develop a Dirac-fermion approach which is valuable to understand and
design high Chern numbers in various multilayers of layered magnetic
topological insulators. Based on the Dirac-fermion approach, we demonstrate how
to understand and tune high Chern numbers in ferromagentic MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$
films through the van der Waals tunability. Further, we also employ the
Dirac-fermion approach to understand the experimentally observed high Chern
numbers and topological phase transition from the Chern number $C=2$ to $C=1$
in the [3QL (Bi,Sb)$_{1.76}$Cr$_{0.24}$Te$_{3}$]/[4QL (Bi,Sb)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$]
multilayers. Our work provides a powerful tool to design the quantum anomalous
Hall states with a high Chern number in layered magnetic topological insulator

<h3>Interpretation of experimental Critical Current Density and Levitation  of Superconductors</h3>

<br>
A recently suggested numerical model to calculate relaxation rates of
superconductors is extended to evaluation of critical current density, JCrit,
and of levitation height, Z, measurements. Besides relaxation rates, the
suggested model delivers relaxation time needed to reorganise the electron
system to a new dynamic equilibrium. Relaxation may request significant
corrections to interpretation of results from traditional JCrit- and
Z-experiments. It is only after completion of this process that results
obtained in JCrit- and of Z-measurements can be verified uniquely. A levitation
experiment and possible alternatives (persistent current measurements,
Cavendish gravitation or magnetic suspension balances) are suggested how to
confirm the anticipated impact of relaxation onto the course of JCrit with
time.

<br>

<br>
<br>
We introduce a machine-learning approach to predict the complex non-Markovian
dynamics of supercooled liquids from static averaged quantities. Compared to
techniques based on particle propensity, our method is built upon a theoretical
framework that uses as input and output system-averaged quantities, thus being
easier to apply in an experimental context where particle resolved information
is not available. Using a deep neural network we predict the self intermediate
scattering function of binary mixtures using their static structure factor as
input. While its performance is excellent for the temperature range of the
training data, the model also retains some transferability in making decent
predictions at temperatures lower than the ones it was trained for, or when we
use it for similar systems. We also develop an evolutionary strategy that is
able to construct a realistic memory function underlying the observed
non-Markovian dynamics. This method, which is much easier than any Laplace
inversion of the memory equation, let us conclude that the memory function of
supercooled liquids can be effectively parameterized as the sum of two
stretched exponentials, which physically corresponds to two dominant relaxation
modes.

<h3>Nonlinear acoustic characterization of heterogeneous plasticity in bent  aluminium samples</h3>

Knowledge of the state of plastic deformation in metallic structures is vital
to prevent failure. This is why non-destructive acoustic tests based on the
measurement of first order elastic constants have been developed and
intensively used. However, plastic deformations, which are usually
heterogeneous in space, may be invisible to these methods if the variation of
the elastic constants is too small. In recent years, digital image correlation
techniques, based on measurements carried out at the surface of a sample, have
been successfully used in conjunction with finite element modeling to gain
information about plastic deformation in the sample interior. Acoustic waves
can penetrate deep into a sample and offer the possibility of probing into the
bulk of a plastically deformed material. Previously, we have demonstrated that
nonlinear acoustic methods are far more sensitive to changes in dislocation
density than linear ones. Here, we show that the nonlinear Second Harmonic
Generation method (SHG) is sensitive enough to detect different zones of von
Mises stress as well as effective plastic strain in centimeter-size aluminium
pieces. This is achieved by way of ultrasonic measurements on a sample that has
undergone a three-point bending test. Because of the relatively low stress and
small deformations, the sample undergoes plastic deformation by dislocation
proliferation. Thus, we conclude that the nonlinear parameter measured by SHG
is also sensitive to dislocation density. Our experimental results agree with
numerical results obtained by Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling. We also
support the acoustic results by X-Ray Diffraction measurements (XRD). Although
intrusive and less accurate, they also agree with the acoustic measurements and
plastic deformations in finite element simulations.

We investigate the influence of obstacles on the collective motion of self
propelled objects in the framework of the Vicsek model. The obstacles are
arranged in a square lattice and have circular shape. We show that by
increasing the radius of the obstacles the collective motion of the self
propelled object can be altered from super diffusive to diffusive. For
obstacles with small radius, the system is composed of large clusters moving in
one direction, for larger radius, the system is composed of small clusters
moving randomly in different directions.

The triangular lattice of rare-earth delafossite compounds sets the
playground for fascinating magnetic ground states, with various types of orders
and also disordered phases. Here we explore the nature of magnetic interactions
in a spin-orbit-coupled transition-metal delafossite, NaRuO$_2$, and find a
sizable antiferromagnetic Kitaev coupling, an off-diagonal $\Gamma$ having the
same sign and magnitude, and a somewhat larger ferromagnetic Heisenberg $J$.
With other interactions set to 0, such $J$, $K$, and $\Gamma$ values yield
ferromagnetic arrangement. Experiment indicates a disordered ground state but
also incipient ferromagnetism in NaRuO$_2$, which raises the question of how
residual longer-range interactions can turn the ferromagnet disordered.

Energy transfer in small nanosized systems can be very different from that in
their macroscopic counterparts due to reduced dimensionality, interaction with
surfaces, disorder, and large fluctuations. Those ingredients may induce
non-diffusive heat transfer that requires to be taken into account on small
scales. We provide an overview of the recent advances in this field from the
points of view of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and atomistic
simulations. We summarize the underlying basic properties leading to violations
of the standard diffusive picture of heat transport and its universal features,
with some historical perspective. We complete this scenario by illustrating
also the effects of long-range interaction and integrability on non-diffusive
transport. Then we discuss how all of these features can be exploited for
thermal management, rectification and to improve the efficiency of energy
conversion. We conclude with a review on recent achievements in atomistic
simulations of anomalous heat transport in single polymers, nanotubes and
two-dimensional materials. A short account of the existing experimental
literature is also given.}

Metal-organic magnets (MOMs), modular magnetic materials where metal atoms
are connected by organic linkers, are promising candidates for next-generation
quantum technologies. MOMs readily form low-dimensional structures, and so are
ideal systems to realise physical examples of key quantum models, including the
Haldane phase, where a topological excitation gap occurs in integer-spin
antiferromagnetic (AFM) chains. Thus far the Haldane phase has only been
identified for $S=1$, with $S \geq 2$ still unrealised because the larger spin
imposes more stringent requirements on the magnetic interactions. Here, we
report the structure and magnetic properties of CrCl$_2$(pym) (pym=pyrimidine),
a new quasi-1D $S=2$ AFM MOM. We show, using X-ray and neutron diffraction,
bulk property measurements, density-functional theory calculations and
inelastic neutron spectroscopy (INS) that CrCl$_2$(pym) consists of AFM
CrCl$_2$ spin chains ($J_1=-1.13(4)\;$meV) which are weakly ferromagnetically
coupled through bridging pym ($J_2=0.10(2)\;$meV), with easy-axis anisotropy
($D=-0.11(1)\;$meV). We find that although small compared to $J_1$, these
additional interactions are sufficient to prevent observation of the Haldane
phase in this material. Nevertheless, the proximity to the Haldane phase
together with the modularity of MOMs suggests that layered Cr(II) MOMs are a
promising family to search for the elusive $S=2$ Haldane phase.

Non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum systems under the effect of
measurement protocols is attracting an increasing amount of attention. It has
been recently revealed that measurements may induce different non-equilibrium
regimes and an abrupt change in the scaling-law of the bipartite entanglement
entropy. However, our understanding of how these regimes appear, how they
affect the statistics of local quantities and, finally whether they survive in
the thermodynamic limit, is much less established. Here we investigate
measurement-induced phase transitions in the Quantum Ising chain coupled to a
monitoring environment. In particular we show that local projective
measurements induce a quantitative modification of the out-of-equilibrium
probability distribution function of the local magnetization. Starting from a
GHZ state, the relaxation of the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic order is
analysed. In particular we describe how the probability distribution of the
former shows different behaviour in the area-law and volume-law regimes.

The Ising model on networks plays a fundamental role as a testing ground for
understanding cooperative phenomena in complex systems. Here we solve the
synchronous dynamics of the Ising model on random graphs with an arbitrary
degree distribution in the high-connectivity limit. Depending on the
distribution of the threshold noise that governs the microscopic dynamics, the
model evolves to nonequilibrium stationary states. We obtain an exact dynamical
equation for the distribution of local magnetizations, from which we find the
critical line that separates the paramagnetic from the ferromagnetic phase. For
random graphs with a negative binomial degree distribution, we demonstrate that
the stationary critical behavior as well as the long-time critical dynamics of
the first two moments of the local magnetizations depend on the distribution of
the threshold noise. In particular, for an algebraic threshold noise, these
critical properties are determined by the power-law tails of the distribution
of thresholds. We further show that the relaxation time of the average
magnetization inside each phase exhibits the standard mean-field critical
scaling. The values of all critical exponents considered here are independent
of the variance of the negative binomial degree distribution. Our work
highlights the importance of certain details of the microscopic dynamics for
the critical behavior of nonequilibrium spin systems.

<br>
<br>
We deal with dynamics of the $\beta$-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with one
free end, subjected to the sinusoidal periodic force. We examine evolution of
the total energy at large times. In the harmonic case, the total energy,
transmitted into the chain, grows in time linearly at non-zero group
velocities, corresponding to the excitation frequency, and grows in time as the
square root of time at zero group velocity. Based on the concept of the
renormalized dispersion relation, large-time asymptotic approximation for the
total energy is obtained in the weakly anharmonic case. Using the
approximation, we analyze energy transfer at the frequencies both in the
pass-band (dispersion relation) and in the stop-band of the harmonic chain.
Consistency of the asymptotic estimates with the results of numerical
simulations is discussed.

A comparative study is done of the propagation of sound pulses in elongated
Bose liquids and Bose-Einstein condensates in Gross-Pitaevskii and logarithmic
models, by means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. It is shown that in the
linear regime the propagation of small density fluctuations is essentially
one-dimensional in both models, in the direction perpendicular to the cross
section of a liquid's lump. Under these approximations, it is shown that the
speed of sound scales as a square root of particle density in the case of the
Gross-Pitaevskii liquid/condensate, but it is constant in a case of the
homogeneous logarithmic liquid.

Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic-electronic
conductors in electrochemical devices for neuromorphic computing,
bioelectronics and energy harvesting. The design of efficient applications
relies on high electrochemical doping levels, high electronic conductivity,
fast doping/dedoping kinetics and high ionic uptake. In this work, we establish
structure-property relations and demonstrate how these parameters can be
modulated by the co-existence of order and disorder. We use in-situ
time-resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman and terahertz
conductivity measurements to investigate the electrochemical doping in the
different morphological domains of poly(3-hexylthiophene). Our main finding is
that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where
they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favoured. On the other
hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically
different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct
regions. We evidence a significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity
when bipolarons start being formed in the disordered regions, while the
presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. Our
study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of
morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced
increase in conductivity.

<h3>Nernst response, viscosity and mobile entropy in vortex liquids</h3>

In a liquid of superconducting vortices, a longitudinal thermal gradient
generates a transverse electric field. This Nernst signal peaks at an
intermediate temperature and magnetic field, presumably where the entropy
difference between the vortex core and the superfluid environment is largest.
There is a puzzling similarity of the amplitude of this peak across many
different superconductors. This peak can be assimilated to a minimum in the
viscosity to entropy density ratio of the vortex liquid. Expressed in units of
$\frac{\hbar}{k_B}$, this minimum is one order of magnitude larger than what is
seen in common liquids. Moreover, the entropy stocked in the vortex core is
\textit{not} identical to the entropy bound to a moving magnetic flux line. Due
to a steady exchange of normal quasi-particles, entropy can leak from the
vortex core. A slowly moving vortex will be peeled off its entropy within a
distance of the order of a superconducting coherence length, provided that the
$\frac{\Delta}{E_F}$ ratio is sufficiently large.

Ground-state entanglement properties in the 1D antiferromagnetic spin-1
Heisenberg model with external magnetic field B and single-ion anisotropy D are
investigated. The logarithmic negativity for nearest and non-nearest neighbor
sites on finite chains is obtained. The resulting phase diagram is discussed in
the B - D plane, and a line where the energy density is independent on the size
is determined and shown to end in a triple point. Finally, results for the
logarithmic negativity on finite chains at finite temperature as a function of
B and D are presented.

<br>
The nature of the gap observed at the zone border in the spin-excitation
spectrum of CrI$_3$ quasi-2D single crystals is still controversial. We perform
first-principles calculations based on time-dependent density-functional
perturbation theory, which indicate that the observed gap results from a
combination of spin-orbit and inter-layer interaction effects. The former give
rise to the anisotropic spin-spin interactions that are responsible for its
very existence, while the latter determine both its displacement from the K
point of the Brillouin zone due to the in-plane lattice distortions induced by
them, and an enhancement of its magnitude, in agreement with experiments and
previous theoretical work based on a lattice model.

<br>
<br>
Antiferromagnets have the potential to bring the clock speed of spintronics,
magnonics, and data storage devices into the THz range. As in thermodynamic
equilibrium, these materials are characterized by an antiparallel alignment of
spins without net magnetization, the search for efficient means to control
antiferromagnets has been a challenge from their very discovery. Under a THz
excitation, any antiferromagnet can be pushed out of thermodynamic equilibrium
into a coherent magnonic state, where all the spins oscillate in phase and a
non-zero net magnetization emerges. Here, we show that this coherent state is a
game-changer for ultrafast control of antiferromagnets: by preparing a coherent
magnonic state in the prototypical antiferromagnet iron borate FeBO$_3$ with a
first THz pulse, we enable the nonlinear coupling of an orthogonal and
otherwise weakly susceptible magnon mode to a second THz pulse. This nonlinear
channel of controlling spins goes far beyond trivial superposition of
excitations and can facilitate conceptually new ways of controlling
antiferromagnetism.

Unprecedented control over the manufacture of electronic devices on nanometer
scale has allowed to perform highly controllable and fine-tuned experiments in
the quantum regime where exotic effects can nowadays be measured. In quantum
dot devices, enhanced conductance below a characteristic energy scale is the
signature of Kondo singlet formation. Precise predictions of quantum transport
properties in similar nanoelectronics devices are desired to design optimal
functionality and control. Standard transport methods suffer from limitations
in nanostructure specifics, set-up design, temperature and voltage regime of
applicability. To overcome these issues, such that we obtain modelling
flexibility and accurate conductance predictions, in this thesis we
analytically derive alternative and improved quantum transport formulations
having as their starting point scattering theory in the Landauer-B\"uttiker
formula, linear response theory in the Kubo formula, nonequilibrium Keldysh
theory in the Meir-Wingreen formula and Fermi liquid theory in the Oguri
formula. We perform a systematic benchmark of our exact expressions, comparing
with the standard approaches using numerical renormalization group techniques.
The new formulations not only reproduce literature results, but also show
higher accuracy and computational efficiency, as well as a wider applicability
under regimes and conditions out of reach by existing methods. We also derive
generalized effective models for multi-orbital two-lead interacting
nanostructures in both Coulomb blockade and mixed-valence regime, which yield
reusable conductance predictions directly in terms of the effective model
parameters. We conclude by applying our novel formulations to complex
nanoelectronics systems, including a single-molecule benzene transistor, a
charge-Kondo quantum dot made from graphene and semiconductor triple quantum
dot.

<br>
<br>
Decagonal quasiperiodic ordering of Sn thin film on $d$-Al-Ni-Co, is shown
based on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction
and density functional theory (DFT). Interestingly, the decagonal structural
correlations are partially retained up to a large film thickness of 10 nm grown
at a 165$\pm$10 K. The nucleation centers called 'Sn white flowers' identified
by STM at submonolayer thickness are recognized as valid patches of the
decagonal clathrate structure with low adsorption energies. Due to the
excellent lattice matching (to within 1%) between columns of Sn dodecahedra in
the clathrate structure and pentagonal motifs at the $d$-Al-Ni-Co surface, the
interfacial energy favors clathrate over the competing Sn crystalline forms.
DFT study of the Sn/Al-Ni-Co composite model shows good mechanical stability,
as shown by the work of separation of Sn from Al-Ni-Co slab that is comparable
to clathrate self-separation energy. The relaxed surface terminations of the
R$_2$T$_4$ clathrate approximant are in self-similarity correspondence with the
motifs observed in the STM images from monolayer to thickest Sn film.

<h3>A model for characterizing anisotropic diffusion in confined molecular  fluids exemplified on water in slit pores and thin ionic liquid films</h3>

Diffusion in confined geometries of porous structures of thin films is an
important problem from the fundamental and applied points of view. However,
accurately resolving the spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficients,
particularly in the direction perpendicular to the interfaces, has been a
standing problem. Naturally, the issue is the interface-induced broken
symmetry. Furthermore, molecules have a finite size, and their shape fluctuates
on a similar time scale as diffusion occurs, while deformation behavior is
additionally spatially dependent. Accounting for these properties of interfaces
and the molecular constituents of the fluid was hitherto not possible. Here we
propose a new approach to deriving the spatially dependent diffusion
coefficients of extended flexible molecules based on a 2-dimensional Fokker
Plank equation and systematic coarse-graining of the internal molecular degrees
of freedom. Our technique does not make assumptions on the separation of time
scales. For small molecules, it reduces to an analytic expression with the
prefactor adapted to different types of interfaces. To demonstrate our method,
we choose water and a family of ILs with increasing cation sizes as
paradigmatic examples of a systems where internal degrees of freedom have
little to major effects. After validating our model on the bulk liquids, we
clearly demonstrate the anisotropic nature of diffusion coefficients and
provide quantitative profiles for the mobility perpendicular to the interfaces.
We find that spatial variations in the diffusivities strongly correlate with
interface-induced structuring of the liquid. Notably, the diffusivity of
strongly confined ILs scales with the density at the solid-liquid interface,
but with a molecular size at the liquid vapor interface.

We perform a projective symmetry group (PSG) classification of symmetric
quantum spin liquids with different gauge groups on the square-octagon lattice.
Employing the Abrikosov fermion representation for spin-$1/2$, we obtain $32$
$SU(2)$, $1808$ $U(1)$ and $384$ $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebraic PSGs. Constraining
ourselves to mean-field parton ans\"atze with short-range amplitudes, however,
the classification reduces to a more limited number, $4$ $SU(2)$, $24$ $U(1)$
and $36$ $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, distinct phases. We discuss their ground state
properties and spinon dispersions within a self-consistent treatment of the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian with frustrating couplings.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically studied the phonon properties of the triangular-, stripe-
and honeycomb-type electronic crystals recently found in two-dimensional
semiconductor moir\'e patterns. By analyzing the phonon dispersions, we found
the interaction induced lattice deformation in the zigzag-stripe crystal
results in a much higher dynamical stability than in the linear-stripe crystal.
Moreover, chiral phonons with finite magnetizations and large Berry curvatures
can emerge in triangular and honeycomb crystals under time-reversal or
inversion symmetry breaking. The small effective mass of the electrons allows
the selective and efficient generation of chiral phonons from the optical
activity of zone-center phonons combined with the anharmonicity, facilitating
the realization of the phonon Hall effect. These findings point to an exciting
new platform for exploring chiral phonons and the related topological phononic
devices.

<i>Francesco Petocchi, Jiyu Chen, Jiajun Li, Martin Eckstein, Philipp Werner</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent theoretical studies showed that the electronic structure of
1$T$-TaS$_2$ in the low-temperature commensurate charge density wave phase
exhibits a nontrivial interplay between band-insulating and Mott insulating
behavior. This has important implications for the interpretation of
photo-doping experiments. Here we use nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field
theory simulations of a realistic multi-layer structure to clarify the charge
carrier dynamics induced by a laser pulse. The solution is propagated up to the
picosecond timescale by employing a memory-truncation scheme. While long-lived
doublons and holons only exist in the surface state of a specific structure,
the disturbance of bonding states in the bilayers which make up the bulk of the
system explain the almost instantaneous appearance of in-gap states. Our
simulations consistently explain the coexistence of a doublon feature with a
prominent ``background" signal in previous time-resolved photoemission
experiments, and they suggest strategies for the selective population of the
ingap and doublon states by exploiting the sensitivity to the pump polarization
and pump frequency.

<br>
<br>
Ion-selective channels play a key role in physiological processes and are
used in many technologies. While biological channels can efficiently separate
same-charge ions with similar hydration shells1-3, it remains a challenge to
mimic such exquisite selectivity using artificial solid-state channels4-6.
Although, there are several nanoporous membranes that show high selectivity
with respect to certain ions, the underlying mechanisms are based on the
hydrated ion size7 and/or charge4. There is a need to rationalize the design of
artificial channels to make them capable of selecting between similar-size
same-charge ions, which in turn requires understanding of why and how such
selectivity can occur. To address this issue, we study angstrom-scale
artificial channels made by van der Waals assembly, which are comparable in
size with typical ions and carry little residual charge on channel walls. This
allows us to exclude the first-order effects of steric and Coulomb-based
exclusion. We show that the studied two-dimensional {\AA}-scale capillaries can
distinguish between same-charge ions with similar hydrated diameters. The
selectivity is attributed to different positions occupied by ions within the
layered structure of nanoconfined water, which depend on the ion-core size and
differ for anions and cations. The revealed mechanism points at possibilities
of ion separation beyond the simple steric sieving.

<h3>Trion clustering structure and binding energy in 2D semiconductor  materials: Faddeev equations approach</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this work, we develop the basic formalism to study trions in semiconductor
layered materials using the Faddeev equations in momentum space for three
different particles lying in two dimensions. We solve the trion Faddeev coupled
integral equations for both short-range one-term separable Yamaguchi potential
and Rytova-Keldysh (RK) interaction applied to the MoS$_2$ layer. The RK
potential has an infrared divergence corresponding to a long-range tail, which
was challenging from the numerical point of view. We devised two different
regularization methods applied to the repulsive electron-electron potential;
one screens the interaction in the infrared and the other in the ultraviolet
region. By extrapolating the trion energy to the situation without screening,
the two methods gave consistent results for the MoS$_2$ layer with a trion
binding energy of $-49.5(1)$~meV for the exciton energy of $-753.3$~~meV. We
analyzed the trion structure for the RK and Yamaguchi potentials in detail,
showing their overall similarities and the dominant cluster structure, where
the strongly bound exciton is weakly bound to an electron. We found that this
property is manifested in the dominance of two of the Faddeev components over
the one where the hole is a spectator of the interacting electron pair.

<h3>Discrete Laplacian Thermostat for Spin Systems with Conserved Dynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrea Cavagna, Javier Cristín, Irene Giardina, Mario Veca</i>
<br>
<br>
A well-established numerical technique to study the dynamics of spin systems
in which symmetries and conservation laws play an important role is to
microcanonically integrate their reversible equations of motion, obtaining
thermalization through initial conditions drawn with the canonical
distribution. In order to achieve a more realistic relaxation of the magnetic
energy, numerically expensive methods that explicitly couple the spins to the
underlying lattice are normally employed. Here we introduce a new stochastic
conservative thermostat that relaxes the magnetic energy while preserving the
constant of motions, thus turning microcanonical spin dynamics into a
conservative canonical dynamics, without actually simulating the lattice. We
test the thermostat on the Heisenberg antiferromagnet in $d=3$ and show that
the method reproduces the exact values of the static and dynamic critical
exponents, while in the low temperature phase it yields the correct spin wave
phenomenology. Finally, we demonstrate that the relaxation coefficient of the
new thermostat is connected to the microscopic parameters of the spin-lattice
coupling.

<br>
Understanding the spin-relaxation mechanism of single adatoms is an essential
step towards creating atomic magnetic memory bits or even qubits. Here we
present an essentially parameter-free theory by combining \textit{ab-initio}
electronic and vibrational properties with the many-body nature of atomic
states. Our calculations account for the millisecond spin lifetime measured
recently on Fe adatoms on MgO/Ag(100) and reproduce the dependence on the
number of decoupling layers and the external magnetic field. We show how the
atomic interaction with the environment should be tuned in order to enhance the
magnetic stability, and propose a clear fingerprint for experimentally
detecting a localized spin-phonon excitation.

We investigate the classicality of linear dipolar droplet arrays through a
normal mode analysis of the dynamical properties in comparison to the
supersolid regime. The vibrational patterns of isolated-droplet crystals that
time-evolve after a small initial kick closely follow the properties of a
linear droplet chain. For larger kick velocities, however, droplets may
coalesce and separate again, showing distinct deviations from classicality. In
the supersolid regime the normal modes are eliminated by a counter-flow of mass
between the droplets, signaled by a reduction of the center-of-mass motion.

We explore a new platform for realising excitonic insulators, namely van der
Waals (vdW) bilayers comprising 2D Janus materials. In previous studies,
Type-II heterobilayers have been brought to the excitonic insulating regime by
tuning the band alignment using external gates. In contrast, the Janus bilayers
of the current work represent intrinsic excitonic insulators. We first conduct
ab initio calculations to obtain the quasiparticle band structures, screened
Coulomb interaction, and interlayer exciton binding energies of the bilayers.
These ab initio-derived quantities are then used to construct a BCS-like
Hamiltonian of the exciton condensate. By solving the mean-field gap equation,
we identify 16 vdW Janus bilayers with insulating ground states and superfluid
properties. Our calculations expose a new class of advanced materials that are
likely to exhibit novel excitonic phases at low temperatures, and highlight the
subtle competition between interlayer hybridization, spin-orbit coupling, and
dielectric screening that govern their properties.

<br>

We explore how disorder and interactions conspire in lattice models with
sequentially activated hopping to produce novel k-body (or many-body) localized
phases. Specifically, we show that when disorder is added to the set of
interacting floquet models considered in [Wampler and Klich arXiv:2209.09180],
regions in parameter space near the special points where classical-like
dynamics emerge are stabilized prethermally (or via many-body localization in
some cases) producing new families of interesting phases. We also find that
this disordered system exhibits novel phases in regions of parameter space away
from the special, Diophantine points. Furthermore, the regions in parameter
space where Hilbert space fragmentation occurs in the clean system (leading to
Krylov subspaces exhibiting frozen dynamics, cellular automation, and subspaces
exhibiting signs of ergodic behavior) may also be stabilized by the addition of
disorder. This leads to the emergence of exotic dynamics within the Krylov
subspace.

Ultrahigh-frequency acoustic-phonon resonators usually require atomically
flat interfaces to avoid phonon scattering and dephasing, leading to expensive
fabrication processes, such as molecular beam epitaxy. In contrast, mesoporous
thin films are based on inexpensive wet chemical fabrication techniques. Here,
we report mesoporous titanium dioxide-based acoustic resonators with resonances
up to 90 GHz, and quality factors from 3 to 7. Numerical simulations show a
good agreement with the picosecond ultrasonics experiments. We also numerically
study the effect of changes in the speed of sound on the performance of the
resonator. This change could be induced by liquid infiltration into the
mesopores. Our findings constitute the first step towards the engineering of
building blocks based on mesoporous thin films for reconfigurable optoacoustic

Moir\'e superlattices engineer band properties and enable observation of
fractal energy spectra of Hofstadter butterfly. Recently, correlated-electron
physics hosted by flat bands in small-angle moir\'e systems has been at the
foreground. However, the implications of moir\'e band topology within the
single-particle framework are little explored experimentally. An outstanding
problem is understanding the effect of band topology on Hofstadter physics,
which does not require electron correlations. Our work experimentally studies
Chern state switching in the Hofstadter regime using twisted double bilayer
graphene (TDBG), which offers electric field tunable topological bands, unlike
twisted bilayer graphene. Here we show that the nontrivial topology reflects in
the Hofstadter spectra, in particular, by displaying a cascade of Hofstadter
gaps that switch their Chern numbers sequentially while varying the
perpendicular electric field. Our experiments together with theoretical
calculations suggest a crucial role of charge polarization changing
concomitantly with topological transitions in this system. Layer polarization
is likely to play an important role in the topological states in few-layer
twisted systems. Moreover, our work establishes TDBG as a novel Hofstadter
platform with nontrivial magnetoelectric coupling.

We study the microscopic mechanism controlling the interplay between the
local charge and local spin fluctuations in correlated electron systems, via a
thorough investigation of the generalized on-site charge susceptibility of
several fundamental many-electron models, such as the Hubbard atom, the
Anderson impurity model and the Hubbard model. By decomposing the numerically
determined generalized susceptibility in terms of physically transparent
single-boson exchange processes, we unveil the microscopic mechanisms
responsible for the breakdown of the self-consistent many-electron perturbation
expansion. In particular, we unambiguously identify the origin of the
significant suppression of its diagonal entries in (Matsubara) frequency space
and the slight increase of the off-diagonal ones which cause the breakdown. The
progressive suppression of the diagonal elements directly originates from the
electronic scattering on local magnetic moments, reflecting their increasingly
longer lifetime as well as their enhanced effective coupling with the
electrons. The slight and diffuse enhancement of the off-diagonal terms,
instead, can be mostly ascribed to multiboson scattering processes. The strong
intertwining between the spin and charge sector is partly weakened at the Kondo
temperature due to a progressive reduction of the effective spin-fermion
coupling of local magnetic fluctuations in the low frequency regime. Our
analysis, thus, clarifies the precise way in which the physical information
between different scattering channels of interacting electron problems is
transferred and highlights the pivotal role played by such an intertwining in
the physics of correlated electrons beyond the perturbative regime.

We demonstrate that the absence of stable quasiparticle excitations on parts
of the Fermi surface, known as the ``nodal-antinodal dichotomy" in underdoped
cuprate superconductors, can be reproduced in models of strongly correlated
electrons defined via a holographic dual. We show analytically that the
anisotropy of the quantum critical continuum, which is a feature of these
models, may lead to washing out the quasiparticle peak in one direction while
leaving it intact in the perpendicular one. The effect relies on the
qualitatively different scaling of the self-energy in different directions.
Using the explicit example of the anisotropic Q-lattice model, we demonstrate
how this effect emerges due to specific features of the near horizon geometry
of the black hole in the dual description.

As a fundamental type of topological spin textures in two-dimensional (2D)

pair with its antithesis to keep the stability in materials. However, it is
challenging to quantitatively calculate merons and their dynamics by using the
widely used continuum model because of the characteristic highly inhomogeneous
spin textures. In this work, we develop a discrete method to address the
concentrated spin structures around the core of merons. We reveal a
logarithmic-scale interaction between merons when their distance is larger than
twice their core size and obtain subsequent statistics of meron gas. The model
also predicts how these properties of single and paired merons evolve with
magnetic exchange interactions, and the results are in excellent agreement with
the Monte Carlo simulations using the parameters of real 2D van der Waals
magnetic materials. This discrete approach not only shows equilibrium static
statistics of meron systems but also is useful to further explore the dynamic
properties of merons through the quantified pairing interactions.

We measured the elastic constants (C_{11}-C_{12})/2 and C_{44} of the
non-Kramers system Y_{0.63}Pr_{0.37}Ir_{2}Zn_{20} (Pr-37% system) by means of
ultrasound to check how the single-site quadrupolar Kondo effect is modified by
increasing the Pr concentration. The Curie-like softening of (C_{11}-C_{12})/2
between 1 and 5 K of the present Pr-37% system can be reproduced by a
multipolar susceptibility calculation based on the non-Kramers Gamma_3 doublet
crystalline-electric-field ground state. Further, on cooling below 0.15 K, a
temperature dependence proportional to root-T was observed in
(C_{11}-C_{12})/2. This behavior rather corresponds to the theoretical
prediction of the quadrupolar Kondo ``lattice'' model, unlike that of the
Pr-3.4% system, which shows a logarithmic temperature dependence based on the
``single-site'' quadrupolar Kondo theory. In addition, we discuss the
possibility to form a vibronic state by the coupling between the low-energy
phonons and the electric quadrupoles of the non-Kramers doublet in the Pr-37%
system, since we found a low-energy ultrasonic dispersion in the temperature
region between 0.15 and 1 K.

Co$_2$MnGa is a ferromagnetic semimetal with Weyl nodal lines identified by
ARPES. We studied electrical transport in thin Co$_2$MnGa lamellae (10 $\times$
10 $\times$ 0.4-5 microns) cut from single-crystals using a focused ion beam.
These crystals exhibit an unexpected and highly unusual planar resistance
anisotropy ($\sim$10 times) with principal axes that rotate by 90 degrees
between the upper and lower faces. Using symmetry arguments and simulations, we
find that the observed resistance anisotropy resembles that of an isotropic
conductor with anisotropic surface states that are impeded from hybridization
with bulk states. The origin of these states awaits further experiments that
can correlate the surface bands with the observed 90$^\circ$-twist geometry.
