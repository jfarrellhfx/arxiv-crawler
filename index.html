<h3>Nanoscale crack propagation in clay with water adsorption through  reactive MD modeling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01226" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01226</a>

The atomic-scale cracking mechanism in clay is vital in discovering the
cracking mechanism of clay at the continuum scale in that clay is a
nanomaterial. In this article, we investigate mechanisms of mode I and mode II
crack propagations in pyrophyllite and Ca-montmorillonite with water adsorption
through reactive molecular dynamics with a bond-order force field. Clay water
adsorption is considered by adding water molecules to the clay surface. During
the equilibration stage, water adsorption could cause bending deformation of
the pre-defined edge crack region. The relatively small orientating angle of
water molecules indicates the formation of hydrogen bonds in the crack
propagation process. The peak number density of adsorbed water decreases with
the increasing strains. The atomistic structure evolution of the crack tip
under loading is analyzed to interpret the nanoscale crack propagation
mechanism. The numerical results show that the crack tip first gets blunted
with a significant increase in the radius of the curvature of the crack tip and
a slight change in crack length. The crack tip blunting is studied by tracking
the crack tip opening distance and O-Si-O angle in the tetrahedral Si-O cell in
mode I and II cracks. We compare bond-breaking behaviors between Al-O and Si-O.
It is found that Si-O bond breaking is primarily responsible for crack
propagation. The critical stress intensity factor and critical energy release
rate are determined from MD simulation results.

<h3>Periodic potential can enormously boost free particle transport induced  by active fluctuations</h3>

Active fluctuations are detected in a growing number of systems due to
self-propulsion mechanisms or collisions with active environment. They drive
the system far from equilibrium and can induce phenomena which at equilibrium
states are forbidden by e.g. fluctuation-dissipation relations and detailed
balance symmetry. Understanding of their role in living matter is emerging as a
challenge for physics. Here we demonstrate a paradoxical effect in which a free
particle transport induced by active fluctuations can be boosted by many orders
of magnitude when the particle is additionally subjected to a periodic
potential. In contrast, within the realm of only thermal fluctuations the
velocity of a free particle exposed to a bias is reduced when the periodic
potential is switched on. The presented mechanism is significant for
understanding nonequilibrium environments such as living cells where it can
explain from a fundamental point of view why spatially periodic structures
known as microtubules are necessary to generate impressively effective
intracellular transport. Our findings can be readily corroborated
experimentally e.g. in a setup comprising a colloidal particle in an optically
generated periodic potential.

<h3>Spin-Polarisation measurement using NbN-Insulator-Ferromagnet Tunnel  Junction with oxidized barrier</h3>

We report a two-step process for the fabrication of
superconductor-insulator-normal metal tunnel junctions using NbN as the
superconducting electrode and its surface oxide as the insulating tunnel
barrier, and investigate its efficacy in measuring spin-polarisation of
ferromagnets using the Meservey-Tedrow technique. We observe that for NbN film
thickness below 10 nm, under the application of parallel magnetic field, the
superconducting density of states show clear "Zeeman" splitting into spin-up
and spin-down sub-bands. Tunnelling measurements on devices where ferromagnetic
Co is used as the normal electrode shows that these devices can be used to
reliably measure spin polarisation of a ferromagnet at temperatures up to 1.6
K. The simplicity of our fabrication process, and the ability to perform
spin-polarisation measurements at 4He temperatures makes NbN a very attractive
candidate for spin polarisation measurements.

<h3>Extraction of diffusion coefficients from the study of Rb release in  different carbon catchers</h3>

<br>
New Target-Ion Source Systems combining a target and a catcher material are
developed in the radioactive beam community, in particular at GANIL, in order
to maximise the yield of very short lived atoms by minimizing the atom-to-ion
transformation time. The aim of this study is to characterize the release
properties of 81Rb collected on two graphite catchers and two carbon nanotube
catchers. The release fractions were measured at various catcher-heating
temperatures and then compared to the analytical expressions relevant to each
catcher. This comparison led to the extraction of the pre-exponential factor
(D0) and the activation energy (Eact) involved in the diffusion coefficient of
Rb for three carbon microstructures. All these data allowed to define an ideal
catcher which could be made of aligned carbon nanotubes of small diameter and
oriented in order to collect all the 81Rb atoms produced by the target but also
to release them efficiently.

<h3>Active turbulence and spontaneous phase separation in inhomogeneous  extensile active gels</h3>

We report numerical results for the hydrodynamics of inhomogeneous lyotropic
and extensile active nematic gels. By simulating the coupled Cahn-Hilliard,
Navier-Stokes and Beris-Edwards equation for the evolution of the density, flow
and orientational order of an active nematic, we ask whether density variations
are important to determine its emergent physics. As in constant-density active
gels, we find that increasing either activity or nematic tendency (e.g.,
overall active matter density) triggers a transition between an isotropic
passive phase and an active nematic one. We show that density inhomogeneities
are important in the latter phase, where we find three types of possible
dynamical regimes. First, we observe regular patterns with defects and
vortices: these exist close to the passive-active transition. Second, for
larger activity, or deeper in the nematic phase, we find active turbulence, as
in constant-density active gels, but with exceedingly large density variation.
In the third regime, which is unique to inhomogeneous active nematics and
occurs for large nematic tendency and intermediate activity, we observe
spontaneous microphase separation into active and passive domains. The
microphase separated regime is notable in view of the absence of an explicit
demixing term in the underlying free energy which we use, and we provide a
theoretical analysis based on the common tangent construction which explains
its existence. We hope this regime can be probed experimentally in the future.

One-dimensional bosonic gas with strong contact repulsion and attractive
dipolar interactions may form a quantum droplet with flat-top density profile.
Employing effective, hydrodynamic description of the system, we study
elementary excitations characterizing response of a droplet to small
perturbation. The excitation spectrum consists of two families: phononic-like
excitations inside droplets and the scattering modes. Analysis within the
linearized regime is supplemented with the full, nonlinear dynamics of small
perturbations. Our study focuses mainly on the regime of infinite contact
repulsion and tight transversal harmonic confinement, where there are analytic
formulas for the density profiles. Moreover, we propose a simplified analytic
ansatz suitable to work also outside this regime, provided the gas is in the
deep flat-top region of density profiles.

<h3>Charge-Density Wave Driven Giant Thermionic-Current Switching in  1T-TaS$_{2}$/2H-TaSe$_{2}$/2H-MoS$_{2}$ Heterostructure</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02024" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02024</a>

<i>Mehak Mahajan, Kausik Majumdar</i>
<br>
1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits several resistivity phases due to the modulation of
charge density wave (CDW). The fact that such phase transition can be driven
electrically has attracted a lot of attention in the recent past towards
\emph{active-metal} based electronics. However, the bias-driven resistivity
switching is not very large ($<$ 5 fold), and an enhancement in the same will
highly impact such phase transition devices. One aspect that is often
overlooked is that such phase transition is also accompanied by a significant
change in the local temperature due to the low thermal conductivity of
1T-TaS$_2$. In this work, we exploit such electrically driven phase transition
induced temperature change to promote carriers over a thermionic barrier in a
1T-TaS$_{2}$/2H-TaSe$_{2}$/2H-MoS$_{2}$ T-Junction, achieving a $964$-fold
abrupt switching in the current through the MoS$_2$ channel. The device is
highly reconfigurable and exhibits an abrupt reduction in current as well when
the biasing configuration changes. The results are promising for several
electronic applications, including neuromorphic chips, switching, nonlinear
devices, and industrial electronics such as current and temperature sensing.

<h3>Identifiying the domain wall spin structure in current-induced switching  of antiferromagnetic NiO/Pt</h3>

<br>
The understanding of antiferromagnetic domain walls, which are the interface
between domains with different N\'eel order orientations, is a crucial aspect
to enable the use of antiferromagnetic materials as active elements in future
spintronic devices. In this work, we demonstrate that in antiferromagnetic
NiO/Pt bilayers circular domain structures can be generated by switching driven
by electrical current pulses. The generated domains are T-domains, separated
from each other by a domain wall whose spins are pointing toward the average
direction of the two T-domains rather than the common axis of the two planes.
Interestingly, this direction is the same for the whole circular domain
indicating the absence of strong Lifshitz invariants. The domain wall can be
micromagnetically modeled by strain distributions in the NiO thin film induced
by the MgO substrate, deviating from the bulk anisotropy. From our measurements
we determine the domain wall width to have a full width at half maximum of
$\Delta = 98 \pm 10$ nm, demonstrating strong confinement.

<h3>Feedback-based active reset of a spin qubit in silicon</h3>

<br>
Feedback control of qubits is a highly demanded technique for advanced
quantum information protocols such as quantum error correction. Here we
demonstrate active reset of a silicon spin qubit using feedback control. The
active reset is based on quantum non-demolition readout of the qubit and
feedback according to the readout results, which is enabled by hardware data
processing and sequencing. We incorporate a cumulative readout technique to the
active reset protocol, enhancing initialization fidelity above a limitation
imposed by accuracy of the single QND measurement fidelity. Based on an
analysis of the reset protocol, we suggest a way to achieve the initialization
fidelity sufficient for the fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Nowadays, intense exotic beams are needed in order to study nuclei with very
short half-life. To increase the release efficiency of the fission products,
all the target characteristics involved must be improved (e.g. chemical
composition, dimensions, physicochemical properties such as grain size,
porosity, density etc). In this article, we study the impact of the target
thickness. Released fractions measured from graphite and uranium carbide
pellets are presented as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the Brownian
motion.

<h3>Development of radioactive beams at ALTO: Part 1. Physicochemical  comparison of different types of UCx targets using a multivariate statistical  approach</h3>

The optimization of the microstructure of the UCx target is a key point since
many years in the field of ISOL method. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the
release of the fission products, especially those with short half-lives.
Fourteen UCx samples were synthetized from different uranium and carbon sources
using three mixing protocols. All carburized samples were systematically
characterized in terms of nature and proportion phases, grain and aggregate
size, open and close porosity proportion and open pore size distribution. Our
results were analysed using a multivariate statistical approach in order to
remove any subjective bias. Strong correlations between the physicochemical
characteristics of the samples as well as the impact of the synthesis process
have been highlighted. In particular, using carbon nanotubes as carbon source
combined with a new method of mixing is the key parameter to limit the
sintering and to obtain samples with small grains and a high porosity well
distributed over small pores. Moreover the microstructure obtained proved to be
stable at high temperature.

<h3>The Influence of Particle Softness on Active Glassy Dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02301" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02301</a>
<br>

<br>
Active matter studies are increasingly geared towards the high-density or
glassy limit. This is mainly inspired by the remarkable resemblance between
active glassy materials and conventional passive glassy matter. Interestingly,
within this limit it has recently been shown that the relaxation dynamics of
active quasi-hard spheres is non-monotonic and most enhanced by activity when
the intrinsic active length scale (e.g., the persistence length) is equal to
the cage length, i.e. the length scale of local particle caging. This optimal
enhancement effect is claimed to result from the most efficient scanning of
local particle cages. Here we demonstrate that this effect and its physical
explanation are fully retained for softer active spheres. We perform extensive
simulations of athermal active Brownian particles (ABPs) and show that the
non-monotonic change of the relaxation dynamics remains qualitatively similar
for varying softness. We explain quantitative differences by relating them to
the longer range of the softer interaction potential, which decreases the cage
length and obscures the intrinsic active motion. Moreover, we observe that only
when the persistence length surpasses the cage length, distinct qualitative
changes with respect to an equivalent passive Brownian particle system start to
manifest themselves. Overall, our results further strengthen the importance of
the cage length and its relation to the relevant active length scale in the
context of active glassy materials.

Solar batteries capable of harvesting sunlight and storing solar energy
present an attractive vista to transition our energy infrastructure into a
sustainable future. We present an integrated, fully earth-abundant solar
battery design based on a bifunctional (light absorbing and charge storing)
carbon nitride (K-PHI) photoanode, combined with all-organic hole transfer and
storage materials. An internal ladder-type hole transfer cascade via a hole
transport layer is used to shuttle the photogenerated holes to the PEDOT:PSS
cathode. This concept differs from previous designs such as light-assisted
battery schemes or photocapacitors and allows charging with only light or
light-assisted during electrical charging and discharging, thus substantially
increasing the energy output of the cell. Compared to battery operation in the
dark, light-assisted (dis)charging increases charge output by 243 %, thereby
increasing the electric coulombic efficiency from 68.3 % in the dark to 231 %,
leading to energy improvements of 94.1 % under illumination.

<h3>Computational Design of Crescent Shaped Promising NonFullerene Acceptors  with 2,3-quinoxaline,1,4-dihydro Core and Different Electron-withdrawing  Terminal Units for Photovoltaic Applications</h3>

<br>
This study aims to design a series of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for
photovoltaic applications having 2,3-quinoxalinedione,1,4-dihydro fused
thiophene derivative as the core unit and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC)
derivatives and different {\pi}-conjugated molecules other than IC as terminal
acceptor units. All the investigated NFAs are found air-stable as the computed
highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are below the air oxidation
threshold (ca. -5.27 eV vs. saturated calomel electrode). The studied NFAs can
act as potential non-fullerene acceptor candidates as they are found to have
sufficient open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) ranging from
0.62-1.41 eV and 83%-91%, respectively. From the anisotropic mobility analysis,
it is noticed that the studied NFAs except dicyano-rhodanine terminal unit
containing NFA, exhibit better electron mobility than the hole mobility, and
therefore, they can be more promising electron transporting acceptor materials
in the active layer of an organic photovoltaic cell. From the optical
absorption analysis, it is noted that all the designed NFAs have the maximum
absorption spectra ranging from 597 nm-730 nm, which lies in the visible region
and near infra-red (IR) region of the solar spectrum. The computed
light-harvesting efficiencies for the PM6 (thiophene derivative donor selected
in our study): NFA blends are found to lie in the range of 0.9589-0.9957, which
indicates efficient light-harvesting by the PM6:NFA blends during photovoltaic
device operation.

The vibrational properties of ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{Mn_3Si_{2}Te_6}$ single
crystals are investigated using Raman spectroscopy and density functional
theory calculations. Eighteen Raman-active modes are identified, fourteen of
which are assigned according to with the trigonal symmetry. Four additional
peaks, obeying the $A_{1g}$ selection rules, are attributed to the overtones.
The unconventional temperature evolution of the $A_{1g}^5$ mode self-energy
suggests a competition between different short-range magnetic correlations that
significantly impact the spin-phonon interaction in $\mathrm{Mn_3Si_{2}Te_6}$.
The research provides a comprehensive insight to the lattice properties,
studies their temperature dependence and shows the arguments for existence of
competing short-range magnetic phases in $\mathrm{Mn_3Si_{2}Te_6}$.

<h3>General theory of emergent elasticity and topological stability</h3>

The raise of the symmetry breaking mechanism by Landau[1] is a landmark in
the studies of phase transitions. The Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition[2-3]
and the Fractional quantum Hall effect[4], however, are believed to be induced
by another mechanism: topology change. Despite rapid development of the theory
of topological orders[5-7], a unified mathematical language describing this new
paradigm of phase transition and its relation to the Landau paradigm, is not
seen. Here, we show that the critical condition for any second-order phase
transitions including topological phase transitions is loss of
positive-definiteness of a second-order variation of the free energy. For
topological phase transitions, the variation is performed with respect to the
emergent displacements of the state variables, which is introduced by
constructing an emergent elasticity problem for any stable field solution. The
Landau paradigm of phase transitions studies global property changes induced
instability, while topology phase transitions study local property changes
induced topological instability. By applying the theory to study several
examples of the band structure of crystals, we show that it can also be used to
study changes of global topological properties. Every field is emergent
elastic, with a spatially dependent stiffness, and topological instability
initiates at the softened points.

<h3>Splashes in isotropic media</h3>

The response of a medium to a sudden localized perturbation (a "splash") will
be explained for isotropic media within the framework of linear response
theory. In this theory splashes result from the interference of the collective
excitations of the medium, with the outcome determined by the interplay between
their phase and group velocities as well as the sign of the latter. The salient
features of splashes are controlled by the existence of extremal values of the
phase and the group velocities: the group velocity gives the expansion rate of
the locus of the points where new wavefronts nucleate or existing ones
disappear, while the phase velocity determines the large-time expansion rate of
a group of wavefronts. If the group velocity is negative in a spectral range
and takes on a minimal value within it, then converging wavefronts will be
present in the splash. These results are relevant to the studies of several
experimentally viable setups, such as a splash on the surface of deep water due
to a small pebble or a raindrop, a splash in the two-dimensional electron gas
caused by a short voltage pulse applied with the tip of a scanning tunneling
microscope, or a bulk splash in superfluid $^{4}He$ due to formation of an
electron bubble. Specifically, the gross features of the latter are determined
by five extremal velocities. Additionally, due to the existence of a negative
group velocity spectral range, some of the wavefronts in superfluid $^{4}He$
splash are converging.

Classical models of spin systems traditionally retain only the dipole
moments, but a quantum spin state will frequently have additional structure.
Spins of magnitude $S$ have $N=2S+1$ levels. Alternatively, the spin state is
fully characterized by a set of $N^{2}-1$ local physical observables, which we
interpret as generalized spin components. For example, a spin with $S=1$ has
three dipole components and five quadrupole components. These components evolve
under a generalization of the classical Landau-Lifshitz dynamics, which can be
extended with noise and damping terms. In this paper, we reformulate the
dynamical equations of motion as a Langevin dynamics of SU($N$) coherent states
in the Schr\"odinger picture. This viewpoint is especially useful as the basis
for an efficient numerical method to sample spin configurations in thermal
equilibrium and to simulate the relaxation and driven motion of topological
solitons. To illustrate the approach, we simulate a non-equilibrium relaxation
process that creates CP$^{2}$ Skyrmions, which are topological defects with
both dipole and quadrupole character.

<br>
We report experiments on the dynamics of vibrated particles constrained in a
two-dimensional vertical container, motivated by the following question: how to
get the most out of a given external vibration to maximize internal disorder
(e.g. to blend particles) and agitation (e.g. to absorb vibrations)? Granular
media are analogs to classical thermodynamic systems, where the injection of
energy can be achieved by shaking them: fluidization arises by tuning either
the amplitude or the frequency of the oscillations. Alternatively, we explore
what happens when another feature, the container geometry, is modified while
keeping constant the energy injection. Our method consists in modifying the
container base into a V-shape to break the symmetries of the inner particulate
arrangement. The lattice contains a compact hexagonal solid-like crystalline
phase coexisting with a loose amorphous fluid-like phase, at any thermal
agitation. We show that both the solid-to-fluid volume fraction and the
granular temperature depend not only on the external vibration but also on the
number of topological defects triggered by the asymmetry of the container. The
former relies on the statistics of the energy fluctuations and the latter is
consistent with a two-dimensional melting transition described by the KTHNY
theory.

The Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is a two-dimensional Olympic-ring-like network of
mutually linked 2.5 kb-long DNA minicircles found in certain parasites called
Trypanosomes. Understanding the self-assembly and replication of this structure
are not only major open questions in biology but can also inform the design of
synthetic topological materials. Here we report the first high-resolution,
single-molecule study of kDNA network topology using AFM and steered molecular
dynamics simulations. We map out the DNA density within the network and the
distribution of linking number and valence of the minicircles. We also
characterise the DNA hubs that surround the network and show that they cause a
buckling transition akin to that of a 2D elastic thermal sheet in the bulk.
Intriguingly, we observe a broad distribution of density and valence of the
minicircles, indicating heterogeneous network structure and individualism of
different kDNA structures. Our findings explain outstanding questions in the
field and offer single-molecule insights into the properties of a unique
topological material.

<h3>The effect of the interlayer ordering on the Fermi surface of Kagome  superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ revealed by quantum oscillations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01294" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01294</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher Broyles, Dave Graf, Haitao Yang, Hongjun Gao, Sheng Ran</i>
<br>
The connection between unconventional superconductivity and charge density
waves (CDW) has intrigued the condensed matter community and found much
interest in the recently discovered superconducting Kagome family of
AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Cs, Rb). Xray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy
measurements established that the CDW order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ comprises of a
2x2x4 structure with stacking of layers of star-of-David (SD) and
inverse-star-of-David (ISD) pattern along the $c$-axis direction. Such
interlayer ordering will induce a vast normalization of the electronic ground
state; however, it has not been observed in Fermi surface measurements. Here we
report quantum oscillations of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ using tunnel diode oscillator
frequency measurements. We observed a large number of frequencies, many of
which were not reported. The number of frequencies can not be explained by DFT
calculations when only SD or ISD distortion is considered. Instead, our results
are consistent with calculations when interlayer ordering is taken into
account, providing strong evidence that CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ has
complicated structure distortion which in turn has dramatic effects on the
Fermi surface properties.

<h3>Steady off-diagonal long-range order state in a half-filled dimerized  Hubbard chain induced by a resonant pulsed field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01298" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01298</a>
<br>
<i>X. Z. Zhang, Z. Song</i>
<br>
We show that a resonant pulsed field can induce a steady superconducting
state even in the deep Mott insulating phase of the dimerized Hubbard model.
The superconductivity found here in the non-equilibrium steady state is due to
the $\eta $-pairing mechanism, characterized by the existence of the
off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO), and is absent in the ground-state phase
diagram. The key of the scheme lies in the generation of the field-induced
charge density wave (CDW) state that is from the valence bond solid. The
dynamics of this state resides in the highly-excited subspace of dimerized
Hubbard model and is dominated by a $\eta $-spin ferromagnetic model. The decay
of such long-living excitation is suppressed because of energy conservation. We
also develop a dynamical method to detect the ODLRO of the non-equilibrium
steady state. Our finding demonstrates that the non-equilibrium many-body
dynamics induced by the interplay between the resonant external field and
electron-electron interaction is an alternative pathway to access a new exotic
quantum state, and also provides an alternative mechanism for enhancing
superconductivity.

<i>X. Z. Zhang, Z. Song</i>
<br>
A many-body quantum system with different parameters may support two distinct
quantum states at the same energy shell. It allows the dynamical transition
from the ground state of pre-quench Hamiltonian to a steady state of
post-quench one. We study the dynamical response of the ground states of a
two-layer half-filled Hubbard model to a perpendicular electric field. We show
that the steady state is conducting state when the field is resonant to the
on-site repulsion, while the initial state is a Mott insulating state. In
addition, two layers exhibit the same conducting behavior due to the formation
of the free particles in both layers, which are manifested by the performance
of the charge fluctuation. Our finding provides alternative mechanism for field
induced conductivity in strongly correlated system.

<h3>Hall Sensor Based Measurements of the Magnetic Phase Diagram of  Superconducting Vanadium</h3>

<br>
Vanadium is an elemental type-II superconductor which has a pure
superconducting phase, a vortex phase, and a non-superconducting phase. We
designed and carried out a low-budget experiment in our undergraduate physics
lab to measure the magnetic field a close distance from the surface of a pure
Vanadium disk sample isothermally with a Hall sensor across a range of
different temperatures and external magnetic fields. We then used these
measurements to compute the superconducting phase diagram of Vanadium. After
completing measurements at eight temperatures ranging from 2.6K to 5K and
magnetic fields ranging from -0.2T to 0.2T, we were able to detect the Meissner
phase (clearly), and a vortex phase (less clearly). Using the graphs of the
hall bar magnetic field versus external magnetic field, we were able to derive
a rough estimate for the upper critical field and the lower critical field of
Vanadium at the eight temperatures wherein we conducted measurements. The
results are in general accord with the phase diagram of Vanadium found in the
literature, except that the critical temperature appears to be less than 5.43K
and 5.13K (about 4.8K). Further, we observed critical fields lower than those
found in the literature. We hypothesize this is due mostly to impurities in our
Vanadium sample (purchased through Amazon.com), which would reduce the measured
critical temperature below that of pure Vanadium, consistent with our results.

<h3>Mobility edge in long-range interacting many-body localized systems</h3>

<br>
As disorder strength increases in disordered many-body systems a new
structure of matter, the so-called many-body localized phase, emerges across
the whole spectrum. This transition is energy dependent, a phenomenon known as
mobility edge, such that the mid-spectrum eigenstates tend to localize at
larger values of disorder in comparison to eigenstates near the edges of the
spectrum. Many-body localization becomes more sophisticated in long-range
interacting systems. Here, by focusing on several quantities, we draw the phase
diagram as a function of disorder and energy spectrum, for a various range of
interactions. We show that long-range interaction enhances the localization
effect and shifts the phase boundary towards smaller values of disorder. In
addition, we determine the relevant critical exponent, with which a diverging
length scale emerges in the system, along the mobility edge. Our analysis
establishes a hierarchy among the quantities that we have studied concerning
their convergence speed towards their thermodynamic limit. Indeed, we show that
deliberately decohering a subsystem can mitigate finite-size effects and
provide results in line with the analytical predictions at the thermodynamic
limit.

Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameters formed the basis for Abrikosov discovery of
the quantum vortex of a supercurrent in type-II superconductor with a normal
core of size $\xi$, the superconductor coherence length and circulating
supercurrent induced magnetic field diverging as $log(1/r)$ from the core with
a decay length of the London penetration depth, $\lambda_L.$ In 1964, J. Pearl
predicted the slowly decaying $(1/r^2)$ field around a vortex spreading out to
Pearl length, $P_L=2\lambda_L^2/t$, in a superconductor film of thickness $t <
\lambda_L$. However, his quintessential theory failed to predict the existence
of giant kinetic inductance (GKI) that arises from the enlarged screening
currents of the vortex. Here, we discover giant kinetic inductance in a
$high-T_c$ metasurface due to the 1400% expansion of the vortex screening
supercurrent from $\lambda_L$ to 14$\lambda_L$ in ultrathin film meta-atom of
$\lambda_L/7$ thickness, which leads to the emergence of terahertz
superinductance possessing quantum impedance exceeding the resistance quantum
limit of $R_Q=h/(2e)^2 =6.47 k\Omega$ by 33%. Our discovery presents a new
class of $high-T_c$ superconductor electronic, photonic, and quantum devices
enabled through metasurface designed at the Pearl length scales, providing
novel applications in quantum circuitry, metrology, and single photon kinetic
inductance detectors.

Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline or amorphous compounds
is a great challenge in solid states chemistry and physics. Pair distribution
function (PDF) analysis of X-Ray or neutron total scattering data has proven to
be a key element in tackling this challenge. However, in most cases a reliable
structural motif is needed as starting configuration for structure refinements.
Here, we present an algorithm that is able to determine the crystal structure
of an unknown compound by means of an on-the-fly trained machine learning model
that combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations with comparison of
calculated and measured PDFs for global optimization in an artificial
landscape. Due to the nature of this landscape, even metastable configurations
can be determined.

The doped perovskite BaBiO$_3$ exhibits a maximum superconducting transition
temperature ($T_c$) of 34 K and was the first high-$T_c$ oxide to be
discovered, yet pivotal questions regarding the nature of both the metallic and
superconducting states remain unresolved. Although it is generally thought that
superconductivity in the bismuthates is of the conventional s-wave type, the
pairing mechanism is still debated, with strong electron-phonon coupling and
bismuth valence or bond disproportionation possibly playing a role. Here we use
diffuse x-ray scattering and Monte Carlo modeling to study the local structure
of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ across its insulator-metal boundary. We find no
evidence for either long- or short-range disproportionation, which resolves a
major conundrum, as disproportionation and the related polaronic effects are
likely not relevant for the metallic and superconducting states. Instead, we
uncover nanoscale structural correlations that break inversion symmetry, which
has far-reaching implications for the electronic physics, including the pairing
mechanism. This unexpected finding furthermore establishes that the bismuthates
belong to the broader classes of materials with hidden spin-orbit coupling and
a tendency towards inversion-breaking displacements.

<h3>Berry Phase and Topology in Ultrastrongly Coupled Quantum Light-Matter  Systems</h3>

<br>
Strong coupling between matter and quantized electromagnetic fields in a
cavity has emerged as a possible route toward controlling the phase of matter
in the absence of an external drive. We develop a faithful and efficient
theoretical framework to analyze quantum geometry and topology in materials
ultrastrongly coupled to cavity electromagnetic fields in two dimensions. The
formalism allows us to accurately evaluate geometrical and topological
quantities, such as Berry phase and Chern number, in ultrastrong and deep
strong coupling regimes. We apply our general framework to analyze a concrete
model of massive Dirac fermions coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode.
Surprisingly, in addition to an ordinary transition to the topological phase,
our analysis reveals a qualitatively new feature in deep strong coupling
regimes, namely, the emergence of reentrant transition to the topologically
trivial phase. We also present its intuitive understanding by showing the
unitary mapping between the low-energy effective theory of strongly coupled
light-matter systems and the Haldane honeycomb model.

<h3>Curvature-Controlled Band Alignment Transitions in 1D van der Waals  Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01379" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01379</a>

<br>
One-dimensional (1D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, formed between
coaxial nanotubes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have emerged as
a new area of endeavor in nanoscience. A key to designing and engineering the
properties of such 1D vdW heterostructures lies on understanding the band
alignment of coaxial nanotubes in the heterostructures. However, how curvature,
tube diameters, and intertube coupling affect the band-edge levels and band
alignment of TMDC nanotubes in 1D vdW heterostructures remains unknown. Here,
through comprehensive first-principles calculations and analyses, we establish
a complete framework of band alignment in 1D vdW heterostructures of TMDC
nanotubes. We reveal that, as the diameter of a TMDC nanotube decreases, the
combined effects of curvature-induced flexoelectricity and intrinsic
circumferential tensile strain cause a rapid and continuous lowering of the
conduction band minimum (CBM), whereas the valence band maximum (VBM) exhibits
an initial lowering before rising, which originates from a change in the
orbital character of the VBM. The transition in the orbital character of VBM
also leads to direct-to-indirect bandgap transition in small-diameter armchair
and chiral nanotubes, as well as photoluminescence quenching in zigzag
nanotubes. As individual TMDC nanotubes form coaxial 1D vdW heterostructures,
the effect of intertube coupling via flexovoltage effect can result in a
transition of intertube band alignment from Type II to Type I in multiple
heterostructural systems, including large-diameter MoSe$_2$@WS$_2$,
MoTe$_2$@MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$@WS$_2$ heterostructures. These results lay down
a foundation for the rational design of 1D vdW heterostructures.

<br>
We study the spontaneous out-of-plane bending of a planar untwisted ribbon
composed of nematic polymer networks activated by a change in temperature. Our
theory accounts for both stretching and bending energies, which compete to
establish equilibrium. We show that when equilibrium is attained these energy
components obey a \emph{complementarity} relation: one is maximum where the
other is minimum. Moreover, we identify a \emph{bleaching} regime: for
sufficiently large values of an activation parameter (which measures the
mismatch between the degrees of order in polymer organization in the reference
and current configurations), the ribbon's deformation is essentially
independent of its thickness.

<h3>Rupture dynamics of flat colloidal films</h3>

<br>
<i>Phalguni Shah, Eleanor Ward, Srishti Arora, Michelle M. Driscoll</i>
<br>
Here, we report experimental results on the rupture of flat colloidal films
over a large range of volume fractions, 0.00 $\le \phi\le$ 0.47. The films are
formed using a constant fluid volume, ruptured with a needle, and recorded
using a high-speed camera. We show that colloidal films rupture in a manner
quantitatively similar to Newtonian fluids, even well into the shear thinning
regime. These results are consistent with the well-known mechanism of the
rupture of Newtonian films, where the rupture rim rolls outward collecting more
fluid and thus film rupture is a shear-free process. However, in the case of
spontaneous rupture under controlled humidity conditions, the same dense
colloidal films show exotic instabilities reminiscent of a wrinkling fabric on
the film surface. These instabilities were absent in manually ruptured films.
We hypothesize that these instabilities occur when the film thickness becomes
thin enough to compete with the colloidal particle size, due to film drainage
before spontaneous rupture. Thus, although non-Newtonian flow properties do not
influence film rupture dynamics for thick enough films, the effect of
microstructure has dramatic consequences in thinner films.

<h3>Controlling 3D spin textures by manipulating sign and amplitude of  interlayer DMI with electrical current</h3>

<br>
The recently discovered interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IL-DMI)
in multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy favors the canting of
spins in the in-plane direction and could thus enable new exciting spin
textures such as Hopfions in continuous multilayer films. A key requirement is
to control the IL-DMI and so in this study, the influence of an electric
current on the IL-DMI is investigated by out-of-plane hysteresis loops of the
anomalous Hall effect under applied in-plane magnetic fields. The direction of
the in-plane field is varied to obtain a full azimuthal dependence, which
allows us to quantify the effect on the IL-DMI. We observe a shift in the
azimuthal dependence of the IL-DMI with increasing current, which can be
understood from the additional in-plane symmetry breaking introduced by the
current flow. Using an empirical model of two superimposed cosine functions we
demonstrate the presence of a current-induced term that linearly increases the
IL-DMI in the direction of current flow. With this, a new easily accessible
possibility to manipulate 3D spin textures by current is realized. As most
spintronic devices employ spin-transfer or spin-orbit torques to manipulate
spin textures, the foundation to implement current-induced IL-DMI into
thin-film devices is broadly available.

Excitonic emission from atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
synthesised on a metal surface is probed with atomic-scale spatial resolution
using a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) approach. A STM-based strategy to
transfer the GNRs to a partially insulating surface is used to prevent light
emission quenching of the ribbons by the metal substrate. Sub-nanometer
resolved STM-induced fluorescence spectra reveal emission from localized dark
excitons build upon the topological end states of the GNRs. A low frequency
vibronic emission comb whose characteristics change with the GNR length is
attributed to longitudinal acoustic modes confined to a finite box. Overall,
our study provides a novel path to investigate the interplay between excitons,
vibrons and topology in atomically precise graphene nanostructures.

<br>
<i>Ravid Shaniv, Sanjay Kumar Keshava, Chris Reetz, Cindy A. Regal</i>
<br>
Mechanical resonators featuring large tensile stress have enabled a range of
experiments in quantum optomechanics and novel sensing. Many sensing
applications require functionalizing tensioned resonators by appending
additional mass to them. However, this may dramatically change the resonator
mode quality factor, and hence its sensitivity. In this work, we investigate
the effect of the crossover from no mass load to a large mass load on the mode
shape and quality factor of a tensioned resonator. We show through an
analytical model and finite element analysis that as the load mass increases,
surprisingly, the resonator mode shape becomes independent of the exact load
mass, and therefore, its quality factor saturates. We validate this saturation
effect experimentally by measuring the quality factor of a silicon nitride
trampoline resonator while varying the load mass in a controlled manner.

<br>
We perform theoretical calculations to study steady-state electron transport
in a double quantum dot, DQD, coupled to a quantized cavity photon field both
in resonance and off-resonance regimes considering weak and strong coupling. In
the resonant strong coupling regime, photon exchanges between the energy states
of the DQD and the cavity are found reflecting multiple Rabi-resonances. The
electron occupation of the states and the transport current can be smoothly
increased by tuning the cavity-environment coupling strength. Making the system
off-resonant, but still in the strong coupling regime, the photon exchange is
diminished and the electron occupation of the system and the transport current
through it are prominent for high cavity-environment coupling strength. In the
weak coupling regime between the DQD and the cavity, the system has almost the
same response in the resonant and the off-resonant regimes at high values of
the cavity-environment coupling strength.

<h3>Laser-induced forces on atoms during ultrafast demagnetization</h3>

<i>G. P. Zhang, Y. H. Bai</i>
<br>
Laser-induced femtosecond demagnetization has attracted a broad attention as
a possible candidate for information storage technology. However, whether or
not lattice vibration directly participates in demagnetization has been highly
controversial over a decade. A recent electron diffraction experiment
attributed the demagnetization to the polarized phonon effect, but a similar
x-ray diffraction experiment attributed it to the Einstein-de Haas effect.
Common to both experiments is that neither the angular momentum of the lattice
nor the rotation of the sample was directly probed. Here, we report our first
first-principles calculation of forces on atoms induced by an ultrafast laser
during ultrafast demagnetization. We employ two complementary methods: (i) the
frozen lattice with electronic excitation and (ii) frozen excitation but moving
the lattice. We find that the forces on atoms start at -50 fs and peak around
30 fs. The magnitude of the force is far smaller than the empirical estimates.
Within the limit of our theory, our results suggest that the polarized phonon
effect and the Einstein-de Haas effect are unlikely to be the main course of
demagnetization. We expect that our finding has a profound impact on the future
direction of laser-induced dynamics in magnetic and quantum materials.

<br>
<i>Fabrizio Tafuri, Andrea Maria Chiariello</i>
<br>
The coil-globule transition of hetero-polymer chains is studied here. By
means of extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations, we show that the transition
is directly linked to the complexity of the chain, which depends on the number
of chemical species defined in the environment and the location of the binding
sites along the polymer. In addition, when the number of species increases, we
find that the distribution of binding sites plays an important role in
triggering the transition, beyond the standard control parameters of the
polymer model, i.e. binders concentration and binding affinity. Overall, our
results show that by increasing the system complexity new organizational layers
emerge, thus allowing a more structured control on the polymer thermodynamic
state. This can be potentially applied to the study of chromatin architecture,
as such polymer models have been broadly used to understand the molecular
mechanisms of genome folding.

<br>
A system of two spins interacting via exchange that are under the influence
of spin-polarized currents can be described using a complex functional, or a
non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian. We study the dynamics of the spins on the Bloch
sphere. In the case of PT symmetry, we show that the nonlinear system exhibits
oscillating motion related to the real eigenvalues of the linearized NH system.
For the full nonlinear system, we derive two conserved quantities that furnish
a geometric description of the spin trajectories in phase space and indicate
stability of the oscillating motion. Our analytical results could provide tools
for a more complete description of the dynamics of NH systems that are defined
on the Bloch sphere.

We analyze the dependence of relative proportion of various characteristic
clusters in binary alcali-borate glasses on modifier's concentration $x$. A
pure $B_2O_3$ glass contains a huge amount of boroxol rings and some amount of
boron atoms in between, linking the boroxol rings via oxygen bonds. The
addition of the $Na_2O$ modifier creates four-coordinated borons, but the
resulting network glass remains totally connected. We study local
transformations that lead to creation of new configurations like tetraborates,
pentaborates, diborates, etc., and set forth a non-linear differential system
similar to the Lotka-Volterra model. The resulting density curves of various
local confugurations as functions of $x$ are obtained. Then the average
rigidity is evaluated, enabling us to compute the glass transition temperature
$T_g(x)$ for a given value of $x$

Open-shell nanographenes can be covalently bonded and still preserve their
local moments, forming interacting spins lattices. In the case of benzenoid
nanographenes, the Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules anticipate the spin of the ground
state of the superstructure, and thereby the sign of the intermolecular
exchange. Here we address the underlying microscopic mechanisms for
intermolecular exchange in this type of system. We find that, in general, three
different mechanisms contribute. First, Hund's ferromagnetic exchange that
promotes ferromagnetic interactions of electrons in overlapping orbitals.
Second, superexchange driven by intermolecular hybridization, identical to
Anderson kinetic exchange, which is a decreasing function of the Hubbard-$U$
energy scale, and is always antiferromagnetic. Third, a Coulomb-driven
superexchange, that increases as a function of $U$, and involves virtual
excitation of excited molecular orbitals that are extended over the entire
structure. We find that Coulomb-driven superexchange can be either ferro or
antiferromagnetic, accounting for Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules. We compute these
exchange energies for the case of coupled $S=1/2$ phenalenyl triangulenes,
using multi-configurational methods both with Hubbard and extended Hubbard
models, thereby addressing the influence of long-range Coulomb interactions on
the exchange interactions.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of monolayer (1L) semiconductors feature
peaks ascribed to different charge-carrier complexes. We perform diffusion
quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the binding energies of these complexes and
examine their response to electric and magnetic fields. We focus on quintons
(charged biexcitons), since they are the largest free charge-carrier complexes
in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We examine the accuracy of the
Rytova-Keldysh interaction potential between charges by comparing the binding
energies of charge-carrier complexes in 1L-TMDs with results obtained using
$\textit{ab initio}$ interaction potentials. Magnetic fields$<8$T change the
binding energies (BEs) by$\sim0.2$ meV,T$^{-1}$, in agreement with experiments,
with the BE variations of different complexes being very similar. Our results
will help identify charge complexes in the PL spectra of 1L-semiconductors

A highly sheared dense aqueous suspension of granular cornstarch particles
displays rich nonlinear rheology. We had previously demonstrated the growth and
onset of interfacial instabilities when shear-thinning cornstarch suspensions
were displaced by a Newtonian fluid, and had suggested methods to maximise
displacement efficiency [Palak, R. Sathayanath, S. K. Kalpathy and R.
Bandyopadhyay, Colloids Surf. A Physicochem. Eng. Asp., 629 (2021) 127405]. In
the present work, we explore the miscible displacement of a shear-thickening
dense aqueous cornstarch suspension by water in a quasi-two-dimensional radial
Hele-Shaw cell. We systematically study the growth kinetics of the inner
interface between water and the cornstarch suspension, and also of the outer
interface between the suspension and air. In addition to the growth of
interfacial instabilities at the inner interface, we observe a transient
withdrawal of the suspension and the formation of fingering instabilities at
the outer interface. We demonstrate that these `reverse fingering'
instabilities at the outer interface are extremely sensitive to the injection
flow rate of water, the gap of the Hele-Shaw cell and the concentration of the
displaced cornstarch suspension, and significantly affect the displacement
efficiency of the suspension. We attribute the growth and development of these
reverse fingers to the build-up of normal stresses in the cornstarch suspension
due to the imposition of large shear rates.

<h3>Absence of the superconducting collective excitations in the  photoexcited nonequilibrium state of underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$</h3>

<br>
Recent observation of the light-induced superconducting (SC)-like transient
response in the $c$-axis optical conductivity far above the SC transition
temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) has
attracted great attention in the field of high-$T_{\mathrm{c}}$
superconductors. Since then, various theoretical and experimental studies have
been devoted to elucidating its microscopic origin. One prominent fingerprint
of the light-induced superconductivity is the emergence of $1/\omega$-like
spectral behavior in the imaginary part of the optical conductivity in the
terahertz (THz) frequency range. However, the spectral profile can also be
described by the Drude response of the quasiparticles (QPs) with a
substantially low scattering rate. To circumvent this critical ambiguity, we
investigated the photoinduced nonequilibrium state in underdoped YBCO samples
using the nonlinear THz optical responses originating from the SC collective
excitations: the THz Kerr effect that reflects the Higgs mode and SC QPs
responses, and the ac-driven Josephson current. Upon the near-infrared (NIR)
photoexcitation above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, the $1/\omega$-like spectral behavior
in the imaginary part of the optical conductivity emerges, whereas the THz
nonlinear responses associated with those collective modes were not observed.
These results indicate that the NIR-pump induced state exhibiting the
$1/\omega$-like response above $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is distinct from the long-range
ordered SC state in equilibrium. According to these observations, the possible
origin of the irregularly coherent charge carrier response along the $c$-axis
is discussed.

<h3>On the self-consistency of DFT-1/2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01636" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01636</a>

<br>
DFT-1/2 is an efficient band gap rectification method for density functional
theory (DFT) under local density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient
approximation. It was suggested that non-self-consistent DFT-1/2 should be used
for highly ionic insulators like LiF, while self-consistent DFT-1/2 should
still be used for other compounds. Nevertheless, there is no quantitative
criterion prescribed for which implementation should work for an arbitrary
insulator, which leads to severe ambiguity in this method. In this work we
analyze the impact of self-consistency in DFT-1/2 and shell DFT-1/2
calculations in insulators or semiconductors with ionic bonds, covalent bonds
and intermediate cases, and show that self-consistency is required even for
highly ionic insulators for globally better electronic structure details. The
self-energy correction renders electrons more localized around the anions in
self-consistent LDA-1/2. The well-known delocalization error of LDA is
rectified, but with strong overcorrection due to the presence of additional
self-energy potential. However, in non-self-consistent LDA-1/2 calculations,
the electron wavefunctions indicate that such localization is much more severe
and beyond a reasonable range, because the strong Coulomb repulsion is not
counted in the Hamiltonian. Another common drawback of non-self-consistent
LDA-1/2 lies in that the ionicity of the bonding gets substantially enhanced,
and the band gap can be enormously high in mixed ionic-covalent compounds like
$\mathrm{TiO_2}$. The impact of LDA-1/2-induced stress is also discussed
comprehensively.

<h3>Nonlinear transport in the presence of a local dissipation</h3>

<br>
We characterize the particle transport, particle loss, and nonequilibrium
steady states in a dissipative one-dimensional lattice connected to reservoirs
at both ends. The free-fermion reservoirs are fixed at different chemical
potentials, giving rise to particle transport. The dissipation is due to a
local particle loss acting on the center site. We compute the conserved current
and loss current as functions of voltage in the nonlinear regime using a
Keldysh description. The currents show step-like features which are affected
differently by the local loss: The steps are either smoothened, nearly
unaffected, or even enhanced, depending on the spatial symmetry of the
single-particle eigenstate giving rise to the step. Additionally, we compute
the particle density and momentum distributions in the chain. At a finite
voltage, two Fermi momenta can occur, connected to different wavelengths of
Friedel oscillations on either side of the lossy site. We find that the
wavelengths are determined by the chemical potentials in the reservoirs rather
than the average density in the lattice.

We report the fabrication of monolithically integrated 940 nm AlGaAs
distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) on graded GaAsP/Si substrates. Low-density
surface bumps and cross-hatch patterns were observed on the DBR surfaces.
Cross-sectional DBR layers are smooth and flat. The reflectance spectra of the
GaAsP/Si DBRs have lower intensities than the GaAs DBRs and have double peaks.
Transfer matrix method calculations, surface scratch and polishing tests were
conducted, which suggest that the surface cross-hatch was the cause of the
inferior DBR reflectance spectra.

<br>
Strong electron correlations underlie a plethora of electronic and magnetic
components and devices and are often used to identify and probe novel ground
states in quantum materials. Herein we report a magnetic phase crossover in
EuMn2P2, an insulator which shows Eu antiferromagnetism at TN=17K, but no phase
transition attributed to Mn magnetism. The absence of a Mn magnetic phase
transition contrasts with the formation of long-range Mn order at T=130K in
isoelectronic EuMn2Sb2 and EuMn2As2. Temperature-dependent specific heat and
31P NMR measurements provide evidence for the development of Mn magnetic
correlations from T=250-100 K. Density functional theory calculations
demonstrate an unusual sensitivity of the band structure to the details of the
imposed Mn and Eu magnetic order, with antiferromagnetic Mn order required to
recapitulate an insulating state. Our results imply a picture in which long
range Mn magnetic order is suppressed by chemical pressure, but that magnetic
correlations persist, narrowing bands and producing an insulating state.

Supercooled liquids undergo complicated structural relaxation processes,
which have been a long-standing problem in both experimental and theoretical
aspects of condensed matter physics. In particular, past experiments
universally observed for many types of molecular liquids that relaxation
dynamics separated into two distinct processes at low temperatures. One of the
possible interpretations is that this separation originates from the two-scale
hierarchical topography of the potential energy landscape; however, it has
never been verified. Molecular dynamics simulations are a promising approach to
tackle this issue, but we must overcome laborious difficulties. First, we must
handle a model of molecular liquids that is computationally demanding compared
to simple spherical models, which have been intensively studied but show only a
slower process: $\alpha$ relaxation. Second, we must reach a sufficiently
low-temperature regime where the two processes become well separated. Here, we
handle an asymmetric dimer system that exhibits a faster process:
Johari-Goldstein $\beta$ relaxation. Then, we employ the parallel tempering
method to access the low-temperature regime. These laborious efforts enable us
to investigate the potential energy landscape in detail and unveil the first
direct evidence of the topographic hierarchy that induces the $\beta$
relaxation. We also successfully characterize the microscopic motions of
particles during each relaxation process. Finally, we study the predictive
power of low-frequency modes for two relaxation processes. Our results
establish for the first time a fundamental and comprehensive understanding of
experimentally observed relaxation dynamics in supercooled liquids.

The traditional systems researched in condensed matter physics always have
spatial translation symmetry. However for space-time crystal systems, the
spatial translation symmetry is no longer preserved and the lattice potential
have space-time translation symmetry instead. We show that a rational
space-time crystal system is equal to a traditional floquet system. Then, we
find a way to solve the floquet equation analytically and construct an
effective Hamiltonian of the rational space-time crystal system. By this
effective Hamiltonian, we obtain the topological classification of gapped and
gap-preserving rational space-time crystal systems. Our works reveal the
correlation between space-time crystal systems and floquet systems and give a
systematic method to explore the properties of rational space-time crystal
systems.

Determining the universality class of a system exhibiting critical phenomena
is one of the central problems in physics. As methods for determining this
universality class from data, polynomial regression, which is less accurate,
and Gaussian process regression, which provides high accuracy and flexibility
but is computationally heavy, have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a
method by a regression method using a neural network. The computational
complexity is only linear in the number of data points. We demonstrate the
proposed method for the finite-size scaling analysis of critical phenomena on
the two-dimensional Ising model and bond percolation problem to confirm the
performance. This method efficiently obtains the critical values with accuracy
in both cases.

Atomically thin molecular carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) with intrinsic
sub-nanometer porosity are considered as promising candidates for next
generation filtration and gas separation applications due to their extremely
low thickness, energy efficiency and selectivity. CNMs are intrinsically porous
which is advantageous over other 2D materials such as graphene and transition
metal dichalcogenides where defects and pores need to be introduced after
synthesis. It was already discovered that water and helium permeate through
4,4-terphenylthiol (TPT) CNM above the limit of detection. Additionally, the
permeation of water vapour was nonlinear against its pressure and 1000 stronger
than permeation of helium despite their similar kinetic diameters. However,
there was no clear permeation mechanism which could explain permeation of both
species. Here, we demonstrate that permeation of all gas species is defined by
their adsorption. We performed gas permeation measurements through TPT CNM at
different temperatures and found that all measured gases experienced an
activation energy barrier which correlated with their kinetic diameters.
Furthermore, we identified that entropy loss during adsorption and permeation
is the fundamental reason of strong nonlinear permeation of water. Our results
also demonstrated that adsorption plays a major role in permeation of all
gases, not just water.

<h3>Widely-sweeping magnetic field-temperature phase diagrams for  skyrmion-hosting centrosymmetric tetragonal magnets</h3>

We numerically investigate the stabilization mechanisms of skyrmion crystals
under thermal fluctuations and external magnetic field in itinerant
centrosymmetric tetragonal magnets. By adopting an efficient steepest descent
method with a small computational cost, we systematically construct the
magnetic field-temperature phase diagrams of the effective spin model derived
from the itinerant electron model on a two-dimensional square lattice. As a
result, we find that a square-type skyrmion crystal is stabilized by either or
both of the high-harmonic wave-vector interaction and the biquadratic
interaction under an external magnetic field. Especially, we discover that the
former high-harmonic wave-vector interaction can stabilize the skyrmion crystal
only at finite temperatures when its magnitude is small. In addition to the
skyrmion crystal, we also find other stable multiple-$Q$ states in the phase
diagram. Lastly, we discuss the correspondence of the phase diagrams between
the effective spin model and the skyrmion-hosting material GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. The
present results suggest a variety of multiple-$Q$ states could be driven by
thermal fluctuations and external magnetic fields in centrosymmetric itinerant
magnets.

<br>
Neodymium nickelate, NdNiO3 attracts attraction due to the simultaneous
occurrence of several phase transitions around the same temperature. The
electronic properties of NdNiO3 are extremely complex as structural distortion,
electron correlation, charge ordering, and orbital overlapping play significant
roles in the transitions. We report the effects of electron and hole injection
via doping a single 3d metal, V, in the NdNiO3 nanostructures to understand the
variations in the electronic properties without any structural distortion. A
reversible resistivity modulation more than five orders of magnitude via hole
doping and complete suppression of metal to insulator transition via electron
doping is observed along with the switching of major charge carriers. The
modulation of electronic properties without any structural distortion and
external strain opens up new directions to consider the NdNi1_xVxO3
nanostructures applicable as emerging electronic devices.

<i>Matteo Scandi, David Barker, Sebastian Lehmann, Kimberly A. Dick, Ville F. Maisi, Martí Perarnau-Llobet</i>
<br>
In this work we explore the use of thermodynamic length to improve the
performance of experimental protocols. In particular, we implement Landauer
erasure on a driven electron level in a semiconductor quantum dot, and compare
the standard protocol in which the energy is increased linearly in time with
the one coming from geometric optimisation. The latter is obtained by choosing
a suitable metric structure, whose geodesics correspond to optimal finite-time
thermodynamic protocols in the slow driving regime. We show experimentally that
geodesic drivings minimise dissipation for slow protocols, with a bigger
improvement as one approaches perfect erasure. Moreover, the geometric approach
also leads to smaller dissipation even when the time of the protocol becomes
comparable with the equilibration timescale of the system, i.e., away from the
slow driving regime. Our results also illustrate, in a single-electron device,
a fundamental principle of thermodynamic geometry: optimal finite-time
thermodynamic protocols are those with constant dissipation rate along the
process.

Charge noise is one of the main sources of environmental decoherence for spin
qubits in silicon, presenting a major obstacle in the path towards highly
scalable and reproducible qubit fabrication.
Here we demonstrate in-depth characterization of the charge noise environment
experienced by a quantum dot in a CMOS-fabricated silicon nanowire.
We probe the charge noise for different quantum dot configurations, finding
that it is possible to tune the charge noise over two orders of magnitude,
ranging from 1 ueV^2 to 100 ueV^2. In particular, we show that the top
interface and the reservoirs are the main sources of charge noise and their
effect can be mitigated by controlling the quantum dot extension.
Additionally, we demonstrate a novel method for the measurement of the charge
noise experienced by a quantum dot in the few electron regime.
We measure a comparatively higher charge noise value of 40 ueV^2 at the first
electron, and demonstrate that the charge noise is highly dependent on the
electron occupancy of the quantum dot.

Na$_2$IrO$_3$ by replacing the interlayer Na$^+$ ions with La$^{3+}$ ions.
(La,Na)IrO$_3$ shows a finite Sommerfeld term in heat capacity and a $-\ln T$
dependence of resistivity, indicating a realization of a metallic state driven
by a Mott collapse. Furthermore, crystal structure analysis reveals the
formation of Ir zig-zag chains with metal-metal bonding, increasing kinetic
energy resulting in the Mott collapse. This observation would be due to a Mott
collapse induced in a $J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/2$ spin-orbit coupling Mott
insulator with an Ir honeycomb lattice by topochemical control of the ionic

<br>
A leading nonlinear effect in magnonics is the interaction that splits a
high-frequency magnon into two low-frequency ones with conserved linear
momentum. Here, we report experimental observation of nonlocal three-magnon
scattering between spatially separated magnetic systems, viz. a CoFeB nanowire
and an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film. Above a certain threshold power of
an applied microwave field, a CoFeB Kittel magnon splits into a pair of
counter-propagating YIG magnons that induce voltage signals in Pt electrodes on
each side, in excellent agreement with model calculations based on the
interlayer dipolar interaction. The excited YIG magnon pairs reside mainly in
the first excited (n=1) perpdendicular standing spin-wave mode. With increasing
power, the n=1 magnons successively scatter into nodeless (n=0) magnons through
a four-magnon process. Our results help to assess non-local scattering
processes in magnonic circuits that may enable quantum entanglement between
distant magnons for quantum information applications.

We consider a neuronal levels model that exhibits critical avalanches
satisfying power-law distribution. The model has recently explained a change in
the scaling exponent from 3/2 to 5/4, accounting for a change in the drive
condition from no input to moderate strength, along with a relaxed separation
of time-scale between drive and dissipation. To understand the robustness of
the scaling features, we examine the effect of different noisy stimuli in the
moderate input regime. Our tool of analysis is the scaling method. We compute
scaling functions associated with the avalanche size distribution, revealing
striking finite-size scaling. For a class of noisy drives, we find that the
scaling exponent can take a value different from 5/4, with an explicit system
size dependence of the distribution.

<br>
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is a powerful tool for studying contact
electrification at the nanoscale, but converting KPFM voltage maps to charge
density maps is non-trivial due to long-range forces and complex system
geometry. Here we present a strategy using finite element method (FEM)
simulations to determine the Green's function of the KPFM
probe/insulator/ground system, which allows us to quantitatively extract
surface charge. Testing our approach with synthetic data, we find that
accounting for the AFM tip, cone and cantilever are necessary to recover a
known input, and that commonly applied heuristics and approximations lead to
gross miscalculation. Applying it to experimental data, we demonstrate its
capacity to extract realistic surface charge densities and fine details from
contact charged surfaces. Our method gives a straightforward recipe to convert
qualitative KPFM voltage data into quantitative charge data over a range of
experimental conditions, enabling quantitative contact electrification
experiments at the nanoscale.

<i>Chin-Lung Li, Shu-Yi Chou, Jinn-Liang Liu</i>
<br>
We propose a generalized Debye-Huckel model from Poisson-Fermi theory to
predict the mean activity coefficient of electrolytes in water-methanol
mixtures with arbitrary percentage of methanol from 0 to 100%. The model
applies to any number of ionic species and accounts for both short and long
ion-ion, ion-water, ion-methanol, and water-methanol interactions, the size
effect of all particles, and the dielectric effect of mixed-solvent solutions.
We also present a numerical algorithm with mathematical and physical details
for using the model to fit or predict experimental data. The model has only 3
empirical parameters to fit the experimental data of NaF, NaCl, and NaBr, for
example, in pure-water solutions. It then uses another 3 parameters to predict
the activities of these salts in mixed-solvent solutions for any percentage of
methanol. Values of these parameters show mathematical or physical meaning of
ionic activities under variable mixing condition and salt concentration. The
algorithm can automatically determine optimal values for the 3 fitting
parameters without any manual adjustments.

<i>Andrei I. Nikitchenko, Nikolay A. Pertsev</i>
<br>
Magnetic droplet soliton is a localized dynamic spin state which can serve as
a nanoscale information carrier and nonlinear oscillator. The present opinion
is that the formation of droplet solitons requires the compensation of magnetic
damping by a torque created by a spin-polarized electric current or pure spin
current. Here we demonstrate theoretically that nanoscale droplet solitons can
be generated and routed in ferromagnetic nanostructures with voltage-controlled
magnetic anisotropy in the presence of uncompensated magnetic damping.
Performing micromagnetic simulations for the MgO/Fe/MgO trilayer with almost
perpendicular-to-plane magnetization, we reveal the formation of the droplet
soliton under a nanoscale gate electrode subjected to a sub-nanosecond voltage
pulse. The soliton lives up to 50 ns at room temperature and can propagate over
micrometer distances in a ferromagnetic waveguide due to nonzero gradient of
the demagnetizing field. Furthermore, we show that an electrical routing of the
soliton to different outputs of a spintronic device can be realized with the
aid of an additional semiconducting nanostripe electrode creating controllable
gradient of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.

The discovery of new high-temperature superconductors is one of the most
critical problems in materials, chemistry, and physics. This work
systematically investigates fluorite-like structures of XBeH8 (X is Ac, Th, Pa,
U, and Np) to gain physical insight into the pressure effects on the
properties. Our results reveal that AcBeH8 and ThBeH8 are two potential
high-temperature superconductors, where AcBeH8 reaching a superconducting
transition temperature of 284.11 K at 150 GPa and even a value of 203.29 K at
50 GPa, ThBeH8 has Tc is 217.65 K at 200 GPa, and the predicted results provide
strong candidates for achieving high temperature or even room temperature
superconductivity. The analysis of pressure effects demonstrates unusual charge
transfer and atomic structure in the system, with s-f migration in Ac/Th atoms
and s-p migration in Be atoms, similar to the high-pressure behavior of
alkaline earth metals. In the past long time, superconductivity and magnetism
were considered unable to coexist. However, UBeH8 and NpBeH8 are two potential
magnetic superconductors with maximum Tc of 60.70 and 107.18 K at 100 and 350
GPa, respectively, and Hubbard U calculations predict their magnetic moments
with 1.52 to 1.90 and 2.49 to 2.92 muB at 0 K. The coexistence of magnetic and
superconducting states may be attributed to the different sublattice actions.

The rotational response of quantum condensed fluids is strikingly distinct
from rotating classical fluids, especially notable for the excitation and
ordering of quantized vortex ensembles. Although widely studied in conservative
systems, the dynamics of open-dissipative superfluids such as exciton-polariton
condensates remain largely unexplored in this context, as they require
high-frequency rotation whilst avoiding resonantly driving the condensate. To
address this challenge, we employ a new technique which uses the interference
of two off-resonant, frequency-offset laser modes, with two different spatial
profiles: Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian. The resulting intensity profile has
broken axial-symmetry and rotates at the offset frequency. We experimentally
demonstrate that this dynamic pump both creates and drives rotation of a
spontaneously formed polariton condensate. We directly image and characterize
the acquisition of angular momentum with rotation frequencies up to 8 GHz,
accompanied by numerical modelling which reveals the crucial role that
mechanical and non-Hermitian mechanisms play in driving condensate rotation.
The demonstration of optical rotation of a spontaneously formed polariton
condensate enables new opportunities for the study of open-dissipative
superfluidity, ordering of non-Hermitian quantized vortex matter, and
topological states in a highly non-linear, photonic platform.

<br>
The motivation of this work is our recent observation of the robustness of
superconductivity in a High-entropy (HE) superconductor
Ag0.2In0.2Sn0.2Pb0.2Bi0.2Te (CsCl-type) to external pressure. The
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of Ag0.2In0.2Sn0.2Pb0.2Bi0.2Te is
almost constant with pressure, described as robustness of superconductivity to
pressure, whereas the PbTe with zero configurational entropy of mixing exhibits
a clear decrease in Tc with pressure. Here, we investigated the atomic
displacement parameters (Uiso), the atomic-vibration characteristics, and the
electronic states of metal tellurides (MTe) with various configurational
entropy of mixing (DSmix) at the M site. The Uiso for the M site is clearly
increased by M-site alloying with DSmix > 1.1R, which is the evidence of local
disorder introduced by the increase in DSmix via the solution of three or more
M elements. The revealed vibrational density of states (DOS) shows a remarkable
broadening with DSmix > 1.1R, which indicates glassy characteristics of atomic
vibration in HE MTe with a NaCl-type structure (low-pressure phase). On the
electronic states of the CsCl-type (high-pressure) phases, where the robustness
of Tc is observed, blurry electronic band structure appears with increasing
DSmix, which indicates the evolution of blurry (glassy) electronic states in HE
MTe with the CsCl-type structure. The estimated electronic DOS at Fermi energy
cannot explain the changes in Tc for HE MTe when assuming conventional
electron-phonon superconductivity, but the conventional explanation seems to
work for PbTe. Therefore, the pairing mechanisms in MTe with DSmix > 1.1R are
affected by glassy phonon and/or blurry electronic states in MTe, and the
robustness of superconductivity would be originating from unique
electron-phonon coupling.

Automated analysis of electron microscopy datasets poses multiple challenges,
such as limitation in the size of the training dataset, variation in data
distribution induced by variation in sample quality and experiment conditions,
etc. It is crucial for the trained model to continue to provide acceptable
segmentation/classification performance on new data, and quantify the
uncertainty associated with its predictions. Among the broad applications of
machine learning, various approaches have been adopted to quantify uncertainty,
such as Bayesian modeling, Monte Carlo dropout, ensembles, etc. With the aim of
addressing the challenges specific to the data domain of electron microscopy,
two different types of ensembles of pre-trained neural networks were
implemented in this work. The ensembles performed semantic segmentation of ice
crystal within a two-phase mixture, thereby tracking its phase transformation
to water. The first ensemble (EA) is composed of U-net style networks having
different underlying architectures, whereas the second series of ensembles
(ER-i) are composed of randomly initialized U-net style networks, wherein each
base learner has the same underlying architecture 'i'. The encoders of the base
learners were pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset. The performance of EA and ER
were evaluated on three different metrics: accuracy, calibration, and
uncertainty. It is seen that EA exhibits a greater classification accuracy and
is better calibrated, as compared to ER. While the uncertainty quantification
of these two types of ensembles are comparable, the uncertainty scores
exhibited by ER were found to be dependent on the specific architecture of its
base member ('i') and not consistently better than EA. Thus, the challenges
posed for the analysis of electron microscopy datasets appear to be better
addressed by an ensemble design like EA, as compared to an ensemble design like
ER.

<br>
Ferroelectrics are technologically important, with wide application in
micromechanical systems, nonlinear optics, and information storage. Recent
discoveries of exotic polarisation textures in these materials, which can
strongly influence their properties, have brought to the forefront questions
about the nature of their domain walls -- long believed to be primarily Ising,
with locally null polarisation. Here, combining three complementary techniques
-- second harmonic generation microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, and
transmission electron microscopy - to cover all the relevant lengthscales, we
reveal the N\'eel character (non-Ising polarisation oriented perpendicular to
the wall) of 180{\deg} domain walls in c-phase tetragonal ferroelectric lead
titanate epitaxial thin films, for both artificial and intrinsic domains at
room temperature. Furthermore, we show that variations in the domain density --
detected both optically and via local piezoresponse, then quantified by radial
autocorrelation analysis -- can give us insight into the underlying defect
potential present in these materials.

<h3>Different effects of external force fields on aging Lévy walk</h3>

<br>
Aging phenomena have been observed in numerous physical systems. Many
statistical quantities depend on the aging time $t_a$ for aging anomalous
diffusion processes. This paper pays more attention to how an external force
field affects the aging L\'{e}vy walk. Based on the Langevin picture of
L\'{e}vy walk and generalized Green-Kubo formula, we investigate the quantities
which include the ensemble- and time-averaged mean-squared displacements in
both weak aging $t_a\ll t$ and strong aging $t_a\gg t$ cases, and compare them
to the quantities in the absence of any force field. Two typical force fields,
constant force $F$ and time-dependent periodic force $F(t)=f_0\sin(\omega t)$,
are considered for comparison. The generalized Einstein relation is also
discussed in the case with constant force. We find that the constant force is
the key of generating the aging phenomena and enhancing the diffusion behavior
of aging L\'{e}vy walk, while the time-dependent periodic force is not. The
different effects of the two kinds of forces on the aging phenomena of L\'{e}vy
walk are verified by both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.

<br>
This report presents a new synthesis protocol for the single crystal growth
of rare earth monopnictide DySb by self-flux technique. A detailed structural,
transport and magnetic characterization have been done using X-Ray diffraction
(XRD), High resolution X-Ray diffraction (HRXRD), resistivity and magnetization
measurements respectively. The Rietveld refinement of powder XRD pattern
confirms that the grown crystal is in single phase and crystallizes in space
group Fm3m(225) of rock-salt type crystal structure. HRXRD on cleaved crystal
confirms the single crystalline nature while rocking curve analysis reveals the
high quality of the grown crystal. Temperature dependent resistivity and
magnetization measurements show a transition at 9.7K from paramagnetic (PM) to
antiferromagnetic (AFM) state.

<h3>Isotope effect on the Casimir force</h3>

<br>
<i>Lanyi Xie, Fuwei Yang, Bai Song</i>
<br>
Isotopic dependence of the Casimir force is key to probing new physics and
pushing novel technologies at the micro and nanoscale, but is largely
unexplored. In 2002, an isotope effect of 10^(-4) was estimated for metals --
orders of magnitude beyond the experimental resolution. Here, by employing the
Lifshitz theory, we reveal a significant isotope effect of over 10^(-1) for
polar dielectrics. This effect arises from the isotope-mass-induced line shift
of the zone-center optical phonons and is insensitive to the linewidth. We
perform numerical analyses on both the imaginary and real-frequency axes, and
derive analytical formulas for predicting the isotope effect.

<br>
More than thirty years ago, carbon nitrides featuring 3D frameworks of
tetrahedral CN4 units were identified as one of the great aspirations of
materials science, expected to have a hardness greater than or comparable to
diamond. Since then, no unambiguous experimental evidence of their existence
has been delivered. Here, we report the high-pressure high-temperature
synthesis of the long-sought-after covalent carbon nitrides, tI14-C3N4,
hP126-C3N4, and tI24-CN2, in laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Their structures
were solved and refined using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction. In
these solids, carbon atoms, all sp3-hybridized, and nitrogen atoms are fully
saturated, forming four and three covalent bonds, respectively, leading to
three-dimensional arrangements of corner-sharing CN4 tetrahedra. These carbon
nitrides are ultra-incompressible, with hP126-C3N4 and tI24-CN2 even rivalling
diamond's incompressibility, and superhard. These novel compounds are
recoverable to ambient conditions in crystalline form and chemically stable in
air. Being wide-band gap semiconductors with intriguing features in their
electronic structure, they are expected to exhibit multiple exceptional
functionalities besides their mechanical properties, opening new perspectives
for materials science.

<h3>Competition between phonon mediated superconductivity and carriers  localization in field-effect doped molybdenum dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01973" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01973</a>
<br>
<i>Giovanni Marini, Matteo Calandra</i>
<br>
Superconductivity occurs in electrochemically doped molybdenum
dichalcogenides samples thicker than four layers. While the critical
temperature (Tc) strongly depends on the field effect geometry (single or
double gate) and on the sample (MoS2 or MoSe2), Tc always saturates at high
doping. The pairing mechanism and the complicate dependence of Tc on doping,
samples and field-effect geometry are currently not understood. Previous
theoretical works assumed homogeneous doping of a single layer and attributed
the Tc saturation to a charge density wave instability, however the calculated
values of the electron-phonon coupling in the harmonic approximation were one
order of magnitude larger than the experimental estimates based on transport
data. Here, by performing fully relativistic first principles calculations
accounting for the sample thickness, the field-effect geometry and
anharmonicity, we rule out the occurrence of charge density waves in the
experimental doping range and demonstrate a suppression of one order of
magnitude in the electron-phonon coupling, now in excellent agreement with
transport data. By solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, we
explain the behaviour of Tc in different systems and geometries. From an
analysis of mobility data, we propose that the Tc saturation is due to carriers
localization and disorder.

<h3>Increased muon field at surface and substrate interface of palladium  thin films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02002" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02002</a>
<br>
<i>Gesa Welker, Martin de Wit, Tjerk H. Oosterkamp, John A. Mydosh, Andreas Suter, Thomas Prokscha, Lucia Bossoni</i>
<br>
We performed depth-dependent low-energy muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu$SR)
studies on three palladium 100 nm thin films, both undoped and doped with 170
ppm of iron. Muons implanted in the surface and substrate interface region
probe an increased local magnetic field compared to the inner part of the
sample. The field increase extends over a few nanometers, it is
temperature-independent (in the range of 3.7 - 100 K), stronger for the
iron-doped samples and accompanied by an increase in local field inhomogeneity.
We consider various potential origins for this magnetic surface state, such as
adsorbents and supressed d-states. Our conclusion is that orbital moments
induced at the surface / interface by localized spins and charges are the most
likely explanation, potentially accompanied by magnetic moments due to crystal
irregularities.

<h3>Topological edge states in dipolar zig-zag stripes</h3>

<br>
<i>Paula Mellado</i>
<br>
We study the magnon spectrum of stacked zig-zag chains of point magnetic
dipoles with an easy axis. The anisotropy due to the dipolar interactions and
the two-point basis of the zig-zag chain unit cell combine to give rise to
topologically non-trivial magnon bands in 2D zig-zag lattices. Adjusting the
distance between the two sublattice sites in the unit cell causes a band
touching, which triggers the exchange of the Chern numbers of volume bands
switching the sign of the thermal conductivity and the sense of motion of edges
modes in zig-zag stripes. We show that these topological features survive when
the range of the dipolar interactions is truncated up to the second nearest
neighbors.

<br>
The transverse and longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) of two samples of the
topological chiral semimetal CoSi with different RRR was studied. It is shown
that the Kohler rule works for the transverse MR. The Kohler rule is also
fulfilled in the case of longitudinal MR at a low reduced magnetic field. A
sharp deviation of longitudinal MR curve for sample with low RRR from the
Kohler prediction at high fields reveals its tendency to a sign change at
higher magnetic fields. The Shubnikov de Haas quantum oscillations were
observed and analyzed in both perpendicular and parallel configurations of the
current and magnetic field in sample CoSi 1 with RRR 9.33 at low temperatures.

<h3>Anomalous dynamical scaling determines universal critical singularities</h3>

<br>
Anomalous diffusion phenomena occur on length scales spanning from the
intracellular to the astrophysical range. A specific form of decay at large
argument of the probability density function of rescaled displacement (scaling
function) is derived and shown to imply universal singularities in the
normalized cumulant generator. Exact calculations for continuous time random
walks provide paradigmatic examples connected with singularities of second
order phase transitions. In the biased case scaling is restricted to
displacements in the drift direction and singularities have no equilibrium
analogue.

<br>
Density is one of the most commonly measured or estimated materials
properties, especially for glasses and melts that are of significant interest
to many fields, including metallurgy, geology, materials science and
sustainable cements. Here, two types of machine learning (ML) models (i.e.,
random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN)) have been developed to
predict the room-temperature density of glasses in the compositional space of
CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2-FeO-Fe2O3-Na2O-K2O-MnO (CMASTFNKM), based on ~2100 data
points mined from ~140 literature studies. The results show that the RF and ANN
models give accurate predictions of glass density with R2 values, RMSE, and
MAPE of ~0.96-0.98, ~0.02-0.03 g/cm3 and ~0.59-0.79%, respectively, for the 15%
testing set, which are more accurate compared with empirical density models
based on ionic packing ratio (with R2 values, RMSE, and MAPE of ~0.28-0.91,
~0.05-0.15 g/cm3, and ~1.40-4.61%, respectively). Furthermore, glass density is
shown to be a reliable reactivity indicator for a range of CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 (CAS)
and volcanic glasses due to its strong correlation (R2 values above ~0.90) with
the average metal-oxygen dissociation energy (a structural descriptor) of these
glasses. Analysis of the predicted density-composition relationships from these
models (for selected compositional subspaces) suggests that the ANN model
exhibits a certain level of transferability (i.e., ability to extrapolate to
compositional space not (or less) covered in the database) and captures known
features including the mixed alkaline earth effects for
(CaO-MgO)0.5-(Al2O3-SiO2)0.5 glasses.

<br>
Around fifty years ago, LiTi$_2$O$_4$ was reported to be first spinel oxide
to exhibit a superconducting transition $\sim$ 12 K. Recently, MgTi$_2$O$_4$
has been found to be the only other spinel oxide to reveal a superconducting
transition with a T$_c$ around 3 K, however, its superconducting state is
realized only in thin film superlattices involving SrTiO$_3$. We find that a
V-doped Mg$_{1-x}$Ti$_2$O$_4$ phase, which is reproducibly stabilized as a thin
surface layer on top of stoichiometric and insulating V-doped MgTi$_2$O$_4$
bulk sample, exhibits high-temperature superconductivity below $\sim$ 16 K. The
superconducting transition is also confirmed through a concomitant sharp
diamagnetic transition immediately below T$_c$. The spinel phase of the
superconducting surface layer is conformed through grazing-incidence X-ray
diffraction and Micro-Raman spectroscopy. A small shift of the sharp
superconducting transition temperature ($\sim$ 4 K) with application of a high
magnetic field (upto 9 Tesla) suggests a very high critical field for the
system, $\sim$ 25 Tesla. Thus, V-doped Mg$_{1-x}$Ti$_2$O$_4$ exhibits highest
T$_c$ among spinel superconductors and also possesses a very high critical
field.

We present a single-crystal neutron diffraction study on the
Shastry-Sutherland lattice system TbB$_4$ at zero magnetic field and under
pulsed high magnetic fields up to 35 T applied along the crystallographic $c$
axis. While our results confirm the magnetic structures at zero-field as well
as those at the half- and full-magnetization plateaus, they offer new insight
into the $\frac{2}{9}$- and $\frac{1}{3}$-magnetization plateaus observed in
this system. A stripe model of polarized 4-spin-plaquettes whose stripe density
proportionally increases with the macroscopic magnetization is in full
agreement with the neutron diffraction data. Equally well suited alternative
models exist which explain the observed Bragg peaks which are inherently
limited in a pulsed high magnetic field experiment. We discuss the different
intensity distribution in $Q$ space which can be used to distinguish these
models in future experiments.

<i>Riccardo Alessandri, Juan J. de Pablo</i>
<br>
The properties of soft electronic materials depend on the coupling of
electronic and conformational degrees of freedom over a wide range of
spatiotemporal scales. State-of-the-art modeling of such properties requires
multiscale approaches that connect quantum-chemical calculations to
coarse-grained (CG) methodologies via backmapping to atomistic resolution. The
computational cost of such approaches, however, seriously hampers their
application in high-throughput computer-aided soft materials discovery. Here,
we present a machine learning-enabled method that can replace the
backmapping-based approach. We illustrate the method for an emerging class of
soft electronic materials: nonconjugated, radical-containing polymers. We train
supervised machine learning models to learn the dependence of electronic
properties on conformations at CG resolutions. We then develop CG models that
retain electronic structure information, simulate CG condensed phases, and
predict electronic properties of such phases solely from the CG degrees of
freedom. We validate our method by comparing it against the backmapping-based
approach. This work demonstrates the capabilities of the proposed method to
accelerate multiscale workflows and informs the development of CG models that
retain electronic structure information.

<br>
Many-body entanglement in condensed matter systems can be diagnosed from
equilibrium response functions through the use of entanglement witnesses and
operator-specific quantum bounds. Here, we investigate the applicability of
this approach for detecting entangled states in quantum systems driven out of
equilibrium. We use a multipartite entanglement witness, the quantum Fisher
information, to study the dynamics of a paradigmatic fermion chain undergoing a
time-dependent change of the Coulomb interaction. Our results show that the
quantum Fisher information is able to witness distinct signatures of
multipartite entanglement both near and far from equilibrium that are robust
against decoherence. We discuss implications of these findings for probing
entanglement in light-driven quantum materials with time-resolved optical and
x-ray scattering methods.

<br>
We propose a method to distinguish between trivial and topological, Majorana,
zero-energy states in both short and long superconductor-normal-superconductor
junctions based on Rashba nanowires using phase-biased equilibrium transport
measurements. In particular, we show how the sawtooth profile of the
supercurrent, due to the Majorana oscillation suppression in the topological
phase for sufficiently long superconductor regions, leads to a strong signal in
its zero-frequency susceptibility for a phase difference of $\phi=\pi$. This
signal is notably insensitive to the chemical potential in the normal region,
while trivial zero-energy states only causes signals in the susceptibility that
is highly varying with the chemical potential, thus turning gating of the
normal region into a simple experimental control knob. Furthermore, we obtain
that, by tuning the junction transparency, critical currents in both short and
long junctions undergo a reduction in the number of oscillations as a function
of magnetic field only in the topological phase, an effect that find to be
intimately linked to Majorana non-locality. Finally, we show that our results
also hold at finite temperatures, thus highlighting their potential
measurability under realistic experimental conditions.

The thermal properties of coarse grained knotted polymers containing two
kinds of monomers $A$ and $B$ fluctuating in a solution are investigated on a
simple cubic lattice using the Wang-Landau MC algorithm. These knots have a
more complex phase diagram than knots formed by homopolymers, including the
possible presence of metastable states. Two different setups are considered: i)
charged block copolymers in a ion solution and ii) neutral copolymers with the
$A$ monomers above and the $B$ monomers below the theta point. A precise
interpretation of the peaks observed in the plots of the specific heat capacity
is provided. In view of possible applications in medicine and the construction
of intelligent materials, it is also shown that the behavior of copolymer rings
can be tuned by changing both their monomer configuration and topology. We find
that the most stable compact states are formed by charged copolymers in which
very short segments with $A$ monomers are alternated by short segments with $B$
monomers. In such knots the transition from the compact to the expanded state
is very fast, leading to a narrow and high peak in the specific heat capacity
which appears at very high temperatures. The effects of topology allow to tune
the radius of gyration of the knotted polymer ring and to increase or decrease
the temperatures at which the observed phase transitions or rearrangements of
the system occur. While we observe a general fading out of the influence of
topology in longer polymers, our simulations have captured a few exceptions to
this rule.

Probing and controlling the valley degree of freedom in graphene systems by
transport measurements has been a major challenge to fully exploit the unique
properties of this two-dimensional material. In this theoretical work, we show
that this goal can be achieved by a quantum-wire geometry made of gapped
graphene that acts as a valley filter with the following favorable features: i)
all electrical gate control, ii) electrically switchable valley polarity, iii)
robustness against configuration fluctuation, and iv) potential for room
temperature operation. This valley filtering is accomplished by a combination
of gap opening in either bilayer graphene with a vertical electrical field or
single layer graphene on h-BN, valley splitting with a horizontal electric
field, and intervalley mixing by defect scattering. In addition to functioning
as a building block for valleytronics, the proposed configuration makes it
possible to convert signals between electrical and valleytronic forms, thus
allowing for the integration of electronic and valleytronic components for the
realization of electro-valleytronics.

<h3>All-electrical valley filtering in graphene systems (II): Numerical  study of electron transport in valley valves</h3>

<br>
This work performs a numerical study of electron transport through the
fundamental logic gate in valleytronics - a valley valve consisting of two or
increasing number of valley filters. Various typical effects on the transport
are investigated, such as those due to interface scattering, long- and short-
range impurity scattering, edge roughness, strain, inter-filter spacing, or
increasing number of valley filters. For illustration, we consider the class of
specific valves built from graphene quantum wire valley filters in single layer
or bilayer graphene, with the filters subject to separate control of in-plane,
transverse electric fields. The nearest-neighbor tight-binding model of
graphene is used to formulate the corresponding transport problem, and the
algorithm of recursive Green's function method is applied to solve for the
corresponding transmission coefficient. In the case of two-filter valves, the
result explicitly demonstrates the existence of a pronounced on-off contrast in
electron transmission between the two configurations of valves, namely, one
with identical and the other with opposite valley polarities in the two
constituent filters. The contrast is shown to be enhanced when increasing the
number of filters in valves. Signatures of Fano-Fabry-Perot type resonances in
association with interface scattering and inter-filter spacing are illustrated.
Electron backscattering due to impurities is found to be sizably suppressed,
with the valve performance showing considerable robustness against edge
roughness scattering. On the other hand, the presence of a uniaxial strain
modifies the electron transmission and results in an interesting quasi-periodic
modulation of transmission as we vary the strain strength.

In this study we perform numerical calculations of the spatial and time
variation of the magnetic induction, current density and temperature in an
infinite superconducting slab with macroscopic inhomogeneities. We also modeled
an homogeneuos superconductor as a referential material, considering
characteristic magnetothermal properties of a high-T$_c$ single crystal. The
theoretical formalism is enclosed in the dynamical regime and a continuum
electrodynamic approach. In particular, we studied the correlation between the
magnetic jumps and temperature rise occurrence with the presence of
macroscopical inhomogeneities, modeled through an stochastic current-carrying
ability spatial profile.

<br>
Photopolymerization processes are exploited in light exposure-based 3D
printing technologies, where either a focused laser beam or a patterned light
sheet allows layers of a UV curable, liquid pre-polymer to be solidified. Here
we focus on the crucial, though often neglected, role of the layer thickness on
photopolymerization. The temporal evolution of polymerization reactions
occurring in droplets of acrylate-based oligomers and in photoresist films with
varied thickness is investigated by means of an optical system, which is
specifically designed for in-situ and real-time monitoring. The time needed for
complete curing is found to increase as the polymerization volume is decreased
below a characteristic threshold that depends on the specific reaction pathway.
This behavior is rationalized by modelling the process through a size-dependent
polymerization rate. Our study highlights that the formation of
photopolymerized networks might be affected by the involved volumes regardless
of the specific curing mechanisms, which could play a crucial role in
optimizing photocuring-based additive manufacturing.

<h3>Experimental confirmation of the redundancy of the axiomatic principles  of statistical physics</h3>

<i>Vladimir Savukov</i>
<br>
In the process of analyzing the axiomatic principles underlying statistical
physics, when modeling the most probable stationary macrostates of non-ergodic
closed systems, a forecast was obtained about a possible limitation purview of
the main postulate, known as the principle of equiprobability for each
realizable of microstate. It is assumed that if such a system is artificially
brought into a thermodynamically equilibrium state, in particular, by filling
it with thermal Planck radiation of the appropriate temperature, then the
subsequent evolution of the state of this system can cause the appearance of
stable polarization anisotropy of said radiation. The paper presents the
successful results of a direct verification of aforesaid prognosis on a real
physical installation. Important regularities characteristic of the applied
mathematical model are noted.

<h3>Shear-wave-induced softening and simultaneous compaction in dense  granular media through acoustic lubrication at flow heterogeneities</h3>

<br>
<i>Charles K. C. Lieou, Jerome Laurent, Paul A. Johnson, Xiaoping Jia</i>
<br>
We report the simultaneous softening and compaction of a confined dense
granular pack in acoustic resonance experiments. Elastic softening is
manifested by a reduction of the shear-wave speed, as the wave amplitude
increases beyond some threshold. No macroscopic rearrangement of grains or
dilatancy is observed; instead, elastic softening is accompanied by a tiny
amount of compaction on the scale of grain asperities. We explain these
apparent contradictory observations using a theoretical model, based on shear
transformation zones (STZs), of soft spots and slipping contacts. It predicts a
linear shear stress-strain response with negligible macro-plastic deformation
due to the small-amplitude acoustic oscillation. However, these waves reduce
the interparticle friction and contact stiffness through the acoustic
lubrication of grain contacts, resulting in an increase in the structural
disorder or compactivity and softening of dynamic modulus. The compaction
associated with this microscopic friction decrease is consistent with the
prediction by an Ising-like correlation between STZs in the subyield regime.

Self-assembly of simple molecules into complex phases can be driven by
physical constraints, for instance, due to selective molecular uptake by
nanoporous surfaces. Despite the significance of surface-mediated assembly in
evolution of life, physical routes to molecular enrichment and assembly have
remained overlooked. Here, using a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal as model
biological material, confined within nanoporous microfluidic environments, we
study molecular assembly driven by nanoporous substrates. We demonstrate that
nanoporous polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces, due to selective permeation of
water molecules, drive transition of disordered isotropic phase to ordered
nematic, and higher order columnar phases under isothermal conditions.
Synergistically, by tailoring the wettability, the surface-to-volume ratio, and
surface topography of the confinements, we program the lyotropic phase
transitions with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Using a
combination of timelapse polarized imaging, quantitative image processing, and
a simple mathematical model, we analyze the phase transitions, and construct a
master diagram capturing the role of surface wettability and channel geometry
on programmable lyotropic phase transitions. Intrinsic PDMS nanoporosity and
confinement cross-section, together with the imposed wettability regulate the
rate of the N-M phase transition; whereas the microfluidic geometry and
embedded topography enable phase transition at targeted locations. We harness
the emergent long-range order during N-M transition to actuate elasto-advective
transport of embedded micro-cargo, demonstrating particle manipulation concepts
governed by tunable phase transitions. Our results present a programmable
physical route to material assembly, and offer a new paradigm for assembling
genetic components, biological cargo, and minimal synthetic cells.

<h3>Imaging the quantum melting of Wigner crystal with electronic  quasicrystal order</h3>

<br>
Wigner crystal, as the most fundamental exemplification where the many-body
interaction forges the electrons into a solid, experiences an intriguing
quantum melting where diverse intermediate phases are predicted to emerge near
the quantum critical point. Indications of exotic Wigner orders like bubble
phase, liquid-solid phase, and anisotropic Wigner phase have been established
by optical or transport measurements. However, the direct visualization of
lattice-scale melting order, which is of paramount importance to unequivocally
uncover the melting nature, remains challenging and lacking. Noting that Wigner
crystals have been achieved in the fractionally filled moire superlattice
recently, here, via scanning tunneling microscope, we image the quantum melting
of Wigner solid realized by further varying the moire superstructure in
monolayer YbCl3/graphene heterostructure. The Wigner solid is constructed on
the two-dimensional ensemble of interfacial electron-hole pairs derived from
charge transfer. The interplay between certain moire potential and ionic
potential leads to the quantum melting of Wigner solid evidenced by the
emergence of electron-liquid characteristic, verifying the theoretical
predictions. Particularly, akin to the classical quasicrystal made of atoms, a
dodecagonal quasicrystal made of electrons, i.e., the Wigner quasicrytal, is
visualized at the quantum melting point. In stark contrast to the
incompressible Wigner solid, the Wigner quasicrytal hosts considerable
liquefied nature unraveled by the interference ripples caused by scattering. By
virtue of the two-dimensional charge transfer interface composed of monolayer
heavy electron material and graphene, our discovery not only enriches the
exploration and understanding of quantum solid-liquid melting, but also paves
the way to directly probe the quantum critical order of correlated many-body
system.

<br>
Moir\'e superlattices that consist of two or more layers of two-dimensional
materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable
platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott
insulators, unconventional uperconductivity and quantum anomalous Hall effect.
Recently, the magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both
robust superconductivity similar to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene
(MATBG) and other unique properties, including the Pauli-limit violating and
re-entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its
electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir\'e potential and
mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer-scale spatially resolved
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) and scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we systematically measure the yet unexplored
band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality. Our measurements reveal the
coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir\'e
flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These
results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional
superconductivity in MATTG.

Soft magnetic materials have low coercive fields and high permeability.
Recently, nanocrystalline alloys obtained using annealing amorphous alloys have
attracted much interest since nanocrystalline alloys with small grain sizes of
tens of nanometers exhibit low coercive fields comparable to that of amorphous
alloys. Since nanocrystalline soft magnetic materials attain remarkable soft
magnetic properties by controlling the grain size, the crystal grains'
microstructure has a substantial influence on the soft magnetic properties. In
this research, we examined the magnetic properties of Fe-Si-B-P-Cu
nanocrystalline soft magnetic alloys obtained by annealing amorphous alloys.
During crystallization, the observation findings reveal the correlation between
the generated microstructures and soft magnetic properties.

We examined what interactions control the sign and strength of the interlayer
coupling in van der Waals ferromagnets such as Fe3-xGeTe2, Cr2Ge2Te6, CrI3 and
VI3, to find that high-spin orbital interaction across the van der Waals gaps
are a key to understanding their ferromagnetism. Interlayer ferromagnetic
coupling in Fe3-xGeTe2 Cr2Ge2Te6, and CrI3 is governed by the high-spin
two-orbital two-electron destabilization, but that in VI3 by the high-spin
four-orbital two-electron stabilization. These interactions explain a number of
seemingly puzzling observations in van der Waals fer-romagnets.

The accurate theoretical description of the dynamic properties of correlated
quantum many-body systems such as the dynamic structure factor
$S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ constitutes an important task in many fields.
Unfortunately, highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo methods are usually
restricted to the imaginary time domain, and the analytic continuation of the
imaginary time density--density correlation function $F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ to
real frequencies is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we argue that no
such analytic continuation is required as $F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ contains, by
definition, the same physical information as $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, only in an
unfamiliar representation. Specifically, we show how we can directly extract
key information such as the temperature or quasi-particle excitation energies
from the $\tau$-domain, which is highly relevant for equation-of-state
measurements of matter under extreme conditions. As a practical example, we
consider \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo results for the uniform
electron gas (UEG), and demonstrate that even nontrivial processes such as the
\emph{roton feature} of the UEG at low density straightforwardly manifest in
$F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$. In fact, directly working in the $\tau$-domain is
advantageous for many reasons and holds the enticing promise for unprecedented
agreement between theory and experiment.

The Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes(BBH) model is one of the most representative
higher-order topological insulators with different bulk-edge correspondence
comparing conventional topological states. In this work, we propose to realize
a couple-BBH model with glide reflection symmetry by coupling two topologically
distinct BBH models. Such a system gives rise to intriguing properties beyond
the traditional BBH model. A topological phase transition from higher-order
topological phase to a semimetal has been predicted in this system.
Furthermore, the band crossing points and nodal ring protected by glide
reflection symmetry has also been explored. Our work provides a viewpoint to
demonstrate the versatile phenomena induced by the interplay between
higher-order topology and nonsymmorphic symmetries.

<br>
A hyperbolic lattice allows for any $p$-fold rotational symmetry, in stark
contrast to a two-dimensional crystalline material, where only twofold,
threefold, fourfold or sixfold rotational symmetry is permitted. This unique
feature motivates us to ask whether the enriched rotational symmetry in a
hyperbolic lattice can lead to any new topological phases beyond a crystalline
material. Here, by constructing and exploring tight-binding models in
hyperbolic lattices, we theoretically demonstrate the existence of higher-order
topological phases in hyperbolic lattices with eight-fold, twelve-fold,
sixteen-fold or twenty-fold rotational symmetry, which is not allowed in a
crystalline lattice. Since such models respect the combination of time-reversal
symmetry and $p$-fold ($p=$8, 12, 16 or 20) rotational symmetry, $p$
zero-energy corner modes are protected. For the hyperbolic \{8,3\} lattice, we
find a gapped, a gapless and a reentrant gapped higher-order topological
hyperbolic phases. The reentrant phase arises from finite-size effects, which
open the gap of edge states while leave the gap of corner modes unchanged. Our
results thus open the door to studying higher-order topological phases in
hyperbolic lattices.

The chiral magnets with topological spin textures provide a rare platform to
explore topology and magnetism for potential application implementation. Here,
we study the magnetic dynamics of several spin configurations on the monoaxial
chiral magnetic crystal $MnNb_3S_6$ via broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)
technique at cryogenic temperature. In the high-field forced ferromagnetic
state (FFM) regime, the obtained frequency f vs. resonance field Hres
dispersion curve follows the well-known Kittel formula for a single FFM, while
in the low-field chiral magnetic soliton lattice (CSL) regime, the dependence
of Hres on magnetic field angle can be well-described by our modified Kittel
formula including the mixture of a helical spin segment and the FFM phase.
Furthermore, compared to the sophisticated Lorentz micrograph technique, the
observed magnetic dynamics corresponding to different spin configurations allow
us to obtain temperature- and field-dependent proportion of helical spin
texture and helical spin period ratio L(H)/L(0) via our modified Kittel
formula. Our results demonstrated that field- and temperature-dependent
nontrivial magnetic structures and corresponding distinct spin dynamics in
chiral magnets can be an alternative and efficient approach to uncovering and
controlling nontrivial topological magnetic dynamics.

We study spin-transfer-torque driven magnetization dynamics of a
perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) nanopillar. Based on the
combination of spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and microwave spectroscopy
techniques, we demonstrate that the free layer (FL) and the weak pinned
reference layer (RL) exhibit distinct dynamic behaviors with opposite frequency
vs. field dispersion relations. The FL can support a single coherent spin-wave
(SW) mode for both parallel and antiparallel configurations, while the RL
exhibits spin-wave excitation only for the antiparallel state. These two SW
modes corresponding to the FL and RL coexist at an antiparallel state and
exhibit a crossover phenomenon of oscillation frequency with increasing the
external magnetic field, which could be helpful in the mutual synchronization
of auto-oscillations for SW-based neuromorphic computing.

We study inserting Co layer thickness-dependent spin transport and spin-orbit
torques (SOTs) in the Pt/Co/Py trilayers by spin-torque ferromagnetic
resonance. The interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy density
($K_s = 2.7~erg/cm^2$), which is dominated by interfacial spin-orbit coupling
(ISOC) in the Pt/Co interface, total effective spin-mixing conductance
($G_{eff,tot} = 0.42 {\times} 10^{15}~{\Omega}^{-1} m^{-2}$) and two-magnon
scattering (${\beta}_{TMS} = 0.46~nm^2$) are first characterized, and the
damping-like torque (${\xi}_{DL}$ = 0.103) and field-like torque (${\xi}_{FL}$
= -0.017) efficiencies are also calculated quantitatively by varying the
thickness of the inserting Co layer. The significant enhancement of
${\xi}_{DL}$ and ${\xi}_{FL}$ in Pt/Co/Py than Pt/Py bilayer system originates
from the interfacial Rashba-Edelstein effect due to the strong ISOC between
Co-3d and Pt-5d orbitals at the Pt/Co interface. Additionally, we find a
considerable out-of-plane spin polarization SOT, which is ascribed to the spin
anomalous Hall effect and possible spin precession effect due to IPMA-induced
perpendicular magnetization at the Pt/Co interface. Our results demonstrate
that the ISOC of the Pt/Co interface plays a vital role in spin transport and
SOTs-generation. Our finds offer an alternative approach to improve the
conventional SOTs efficiencies and generate unconventional SOTs with
out-of-plane spin polarization to develop low power Pt-based spintronic via
tailoring the Pt/FM interface.

Characterizing and controlling entanglement in quantum materials is a crucial
step towards their functionalization in next-generation quantum technologies.
However, defining a quantifiable figure of merit for entanglement in a material
and in the thermodynamic limit is both theoretically and experimentally
challenging. At equilibrium the presence of entanglement can be diagnosed by
extracting entanglement witnesses from spectroscopic observables and extending
this approach to nonequilibrium states of matter could lead to the discovery of
novel dynamical phenomena. Here, we propose a systematic approach to quantify
the time-dependent quantum Fisher information and the entanglement depth of
transient states of quantum materials through time-resolved resonant inelastic
x-ray scattering, a recently developed pump-probe technique for solid-state
materials. Using a quarter-filled extended Hubbard model as an example, we
benchmark the efficiency of this method and predict a light-enhanced quantum
entanglement at low momentum, due to the proximity to a phase boundary. Our
work sets the stage for experimentally witnessing and controlling entanglement
in light-driven quantum materials via solid-state accessible ultrafast
spectroscopic measurements.

We demonstrate topological characterization of $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev quantum
spin liquids on a series of one-dimensional honeycomb nanoribbon lattices with
zigzag and armchair terminated edges. We draw their Majorana spinon phase
diagrams with varying nearest-neighbor exchange couplings not only at the
sector of the ground flux configuration but also at some sectors of excited
flux configurations. In the ground states of the zigzag and armchair
nanoribbons, there occur a single and multiple phase transitions, respectively,
the former and latter of which are insensitive and subject to the background
flux configuration, respectively. Topological phases each have a winding number
as their invariant. On each phase boundary, the Majorana spinon dispersion
relation reflects both of the change in the winding number and the background
flux configuration.

<br>
We theoretically analyze spin filtering in two-terminal systems, induced by
the spin-orbit interaction (SOI), as a possible origin of the
``chirality-induced spin selectivity'' (CISS) effect observed experimentally in
chiral molecules, such as DNA. Due to Bardarson's theorem, spin filtering
cannot be realized in a molecule containing one orbital-channel. However, when
two orbitals are involved, SOI can induce spin filtering in a molecule coupled
to two terminals without braking time-reversal symmetry. In particular, we
provide an example of a $4 \times 4$ reflection matrix for a spinful electron
passing through a molecule containing two orbital-channels, which complies with
Bardarson's theorem and produces a finite spin conductance. As a microscopic
toy model realizing a single strand of DNA, we consider a $p$-orbital helical
atomic chain with intra-atomic SOI's and a strong crystalline field along the
helix. This model exhibits two-orbital spin filtering: For various parameters
preserving the helical symmetry, the model hosts spin asymmetric states
carrying pairs of up and down spins propagating in opposite directions. The
typical energy scale of the helical states is the product of the intra-atomic
SOI and the curvature. The large value of this energy identifies our model as a
likely candidate to explain the CISS in organic molecules.

Post-transition metal chalcogenides (PTMCs) such as GaSe, GaS, InSe, and InS
have been proposed as promising thermoelectric materials due to low lattice
conductivity, originating from the atomically layered structure, high Seebeck
coefficient, and the anticipation that its figure-of-merit be improved when
thinned to few-layers as the band structure turns into Mexican-hat valence band
(MHVB). Here we show by ab initio calculations that the MHVB should be present
even on thick films of InSe/GaSe type-II heterostructures, and a 50%
enhancement on thermoelectric figure-of-merit zT at room-temperature is
expected when compared with bulk InSe.

<br>
Skyrmions can appear in non-centrosymmetric material because of the
non-vanishing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI). In this paper, we study
the magnetic properties of the rhombohedral MX$_{3}$ (M: V, Cr, Mn, and Fe. X:
Cl, Br, and I) van der Waals materials with centrosymmetric lattice by
combining first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We found
that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector acting between the second nearest
neighbor sites of the intra-layer is non-zero and quite large even in MX$_{3}$
due to the breaking of the local inversion symmetry. We have found that the
large DMI causes nano-scale magnetic vortexes, so-called skyrmions in MX$_{3}$.
The diameter of skyrmions, e.g., in CrCl$_{3}$, is small, i.e., 2 nm, which is
promising for the application of high-density magnetic memory devices. We have
also found that not only conventional skyrmions in CrCl$_{3}$ and VCl$_{3}$ but
also antiferromagnetic skyrmions in FeCl$_{3}$ and meron in MnCl$_{3}$ appear.
Furthermore, we have found that the skyrmions in ClCl$_{3}$ and VCl$_{3}$ have
a different helicity, which shows the possibility of controlling the helicity
by electron/hole doping in MX$_{3}$ materials. Van der Waals materials, which
have a great advantage of high degrees of freedom in structures such as
heterostructures and twisted structures, exhibit high potential as skyrmion
materials.

<br>
We propose a stochastic process of interacting many agents, which is inspired
by rank-based supplanting dynamics commonly observed in a group of Japanese
Macaques. In order to characterize the breaking of permutation symmetry with
respect to agents' rank in the stochastic process, we introduce a
rank-dependent quantity, overlap centrality, which quantifies how often a given
agent overlaps with the other agents. We give a sufficient condition in a wide
class of the models such that overlap centrality shows perfect correlation in
terms of the agents' rank in zero-supplanting limit. We also discuss a
singularity of the correlation in the case of interaction induced by a Potts
energy.

<h3>Internal mechanical dissipation mechanisms in amorphous silicon</h3>

<br>

<br>
Using the Activation-Relaxation Technique-nouveau, we search for two-level
systems (TLSs) in models of amorphous silicon (a-Si). The TLSs are mechanisms
related to internal mechanical dissipation and represent the main source of
noise in the most sensitive frequency range of the largest gravitational wave
detectors as well as one of the main sources of decoherence in many quantum
computers. We show that in a-Si, the majority of the TLSs of interest fall into
two main categories: bond-defect hopping where neighbors exchange a topological
defect and the Wooten-Winer-Weaire bond exchange. The distribution of these
categories depends heavily on the preparation schedule of the a-Si. We use our
results to compute the mechanical loss in amorphous silicon, leading to a loss
angle of 0.001 at room temperature, decreasing to 0.0001 at 150 K in some
configurations. Our modeling results indicate that multiple classes of events
can cause experimentally-relevant TLSs in disordered materials and, therefore,
multiple attenuation strategies might be needed to reduce their impact.

<h3>Bulk-LDOS Correspondence in Topological Insulators</h3>

<i>Biye Xie, Renwen Huang, Shiyin Jia, Zemeng Lin, Junzheng Hu, Yao Jiang, Shaojie Ma, Peng Zhan, Minghui Lu, Zhenlin Wang, Yanfeng Chen, Shuang Zhang</i>
<br>
Seeking the criterion for diagnosing topological phases in real materials has
been one of the major tasks in topological physics. Currently, bulk-boundary
correspondence based on spectral measurements of in gap topological boundary
states and the fractional corner anomaly derived from the measurement of the
fractional spectral charge are two main approaches to characterize
topologically insulating phases. However, these two methods require a complete
band-gap with either in-gap states or strict spatial symmetry of the overall
sample which significantly limits their applications to more generalized cases.
Here we propose and demonstrate an approach to link the non-trivial
hierarchical bulk topology to the multidimensional partition of local-density
of states (LDOS) respectively, denoted as the bulk-LDOS correspondence.
Specifically, in a finite-size topologically nontrivial photonic crystal, we
observe that the distribution of LDOS is divided into three partitioned regions
of the sample - the two-dimensional interior bulk area (avoiding edge and
corner areas), one-dimensional edge region (avoiding the corner area), and
zero-dimensional corner sites. In contrast, the LDOS is distributed across the
entire two-dimensional bulk area across the whole spectrum for the
topologically trivial cases. Moreover, we present the universality of this
criterion by validating this correspondence in both a higher-order topological
insulator without a complete band gap and with disorders. Our findings provide
a general way to distinguish topological insulators and unveil the unexplored
features of topological directional band-gap materials without in-gap states.

<h3>Acoustic mirror Chern insulator with projective parity-time symmetry</h3>

<br>

<br>
In condensed matter physics, symmetry profoundly governs the fundamentals of
topological matter. The emergence of new topological phase is typically linked
to the enrichment of symmetries. Different parity-time symmetry relations
distinguish between spinless and spinful physical systems. In spinless systems,
creating pseudo-spins can realize fragile topological phase but not break the
time-reversal symmetry. Therefore, growing attentions were recently focused on
the strong topological phase in spinless systems. Here we break the framework
of crystallographic symmetry groups by utilizing the projective symmetry gauge
field, to realize the Mirror Chern Insulator in a bilayer twisted Hofstadter
model. In experiments, the edge modes were unambiguously observed with
odd-shaped boundaries, confirming the strong topological features.The clockwise
and anti-clockwise edge states with opposite group velocities were completely
separated via an energy drain. In addition, we demonstrate that MCI has robust
topological whispering gallery modes. Our work establishes a strong foundation
for investigating exotic topological effects arising from the interplays
between artificial gauge fields and wave systems. The clockwise and
anti-clockwise edge states with opposite group velocities were completely

<br>
<i>Xianxin Wu, Debmalya Chakraborty, Andreas P. Schnyder, Andrés Greco</i>
<br>
We study electron-electron and electron-phonon mediated pairing in the
Holstein extended Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice at the van Hove fillings,
and investigate the competition and cooperation between the two pairing
mechanisms. We find that electron-phonon and electron-electron pairing are
cooperative in a crossover region, where the two pairing mechanisms are of
comparable strength and where the filling is close to a van Hove singularity.
In particular, at the $p$-type van Hove filling the two pairing mechanisms are
cooperative in the $E_{1u}$ ($p$-wave) and $B_{2u}$ ($f_{y^3-3yx^2}$-wave)
channels, whereas at the $m$-type van Hove filling they are cooperative in the
$E_{1u}$ channel, but weakly competitive in the $B_{2u}$ channel. Moreover, we
show that the electron-phonon interaction acquires a significant momentum
dependence, due to the sublattice texture of the Fermi surfaces, which can
promote non $s$-wave pairing. We present a detailed analysis of these pairing
propensities and discuss implications for the vanadium-based kagome
superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$.

<h3>Proper Orthogonal Descriptors for Efficient and Accurate Interatomic  Potentials</h3>

<br>
<i>Ngoc Cuong Nguyen, Andrew Rohskopf</i>
<br>
We present the proper orthogonal descriptors for efficient and accuracy
representation of the potential energy surface. The potential energy surface is
represented as a many-body expansion of parametrized potentials in which the
potentials are functions of atom positions and parameters. The Karhunen-Lo\`eve
(KL) expansion is employed to decompose the parametrized potentials into a set
of proper orthogonal descriptors (PODs). Because of the rapid convergence of
the KL expansion, relevant snapshots can be sampled exhaustively to represent
the atomic neighborhood environment accurately with a small number of
descriptors. The proper orthogonal descriptors are used to develop interatomic
potentials by using a linear expansion of the descriptors and determining the
expansion coefficients from a weighted least-squares regression against a
density functional theory (DFT) training set. We present a comprehensive
evaluation of the POD potentials on previously published DFT data sets
comprising Li, Mo, Cu, Ni, Si, Ge, and Ta elements. The data sets represent a
diverse pool of metals, transition metals, and semiconductors. The accuracy of
the POD potentials are comparable to that of state-of-the-art machine learning
potentials such as the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and the
atomic cluster expansion (ACE).

<h3>Symmetry-enforced planar nodal chain phonons in non-symmorphic materials</h3>

Topological semimetal states which are constrained by symmetries and give
birth to innovative excitations are the frontiers of topological quantum
matter. Nodal chains in which two nodal rings connect at one point were first
discovered in non-symmorphic electronic systems and then generalized to
symmorphic phononic systems. In this work, we identify a new class of planar
nodal chains in non-symmorphic phononic systems, where the connecting rings lie
in the same plane. The constituting nodal rings are protected by mirror
symmetry, their intersection is guaranteed by the combination of time-reversal
and non-symmorphic two-fold screw symmetry. In addition, the connecting points
are four-fold degenerate while those in previous works are two-fold degenerate.
We searched all 230 space groups and found 8 space groups that can host the
proposed planar nodal chain phonons. Taking wurtzite GaN (space group No.186)
as an example, the planar nodal chain is confirmed by first-principles
calculations. The planar nodal chains result in two distinct classes of
drumhead surface. The first category lies on the [10(-1)0] surface Brillouin
zone and the second lies on the [0001] surface Brillouin zone. Our finding
reveals a class of planar nodal chains in non-symmorphic phononic systems,
expands the catalog of topological nodal chains, and enriches the family of
topological surface states.

<br>
Phonon-derived behaviors are important indicators of novel phenomena in
transition metal trihalides, including spin liquid behavior, two-dimensional
magnetism, and spin-lattice coupling. However, phonons and their dependence on
spin structure and excitations have not been adequately explored. In this work,
we probe and critically examine the vibrational properties of bulk $CrCl_3$
using inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory. We
demonstrate that magnetic and van der Waals interactions are essential to
describing the structure and phonons in $CrCl_3$; however, the specific spin
configuration is unimportant. This provides context for understanding thermal
transport measurements as governed by dynamical spin-lattice couplings. More
importantly, we introduce an efficient dynamic method that exploits
translational symmetries in large conventional unit cells that generates
insights into phonon dispersions, interactions, and measured spectra in terms
of quantum phase interference conditions. This work opens new avenues for
understanding phonons in layered magnets and more generally in conventional
cell geometries of a variety of materials.

<br>
Lithium fluorinated carbon is one of the most promising chemistries for
high-energy-density primary energy storage systems in applications where
rechargeability is not required. Though Li/CFx demonstrates high energy density
under ambient conditions, achieving such a high energy density when exposed to
subzero temperatures remains a challenge, particularly under high current
density. Here, we report a liquefied gas electrolyte with an anion-pair
solvation structure based on dimethyl ether with a low melting point and low
viscosity, leading to high ionic conductivity between a wide temperature range.
Besides that, through systematic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy integrated
with transmission electron microscopy characterizations, we evaluate the
interface of CFx for low-temperature performance. We conclude that the fast
transport and anion-pairing solvation structure of the electrolyte bring about
reduced charge transfer resistance at low temperatures, which resulted in
significantly enhanced performance of Li/CFx cells. Utilizing 50 mg/cm2 loading
electrodes, the Li/CFx still displayed 1530 Wh/kg at reduced temperature. This
work provides insights into the electrolyte design that may overcome the
operational limits of batteries in extreme environments.

<h3>Emergence of damped-localized excitations of the Mott state due to  disorder</h3>

<br>
We investigate the effect of disorder upon the excitations of the Mott
insulating state at zero temperature described by the Bose-Hubbard model. Using
a field-theoretical approach we obtain a resummed expression for the disorder
ensemble average of the spectral function. Its analysis shows that disorder
leads to an increase of the effective mass of both quasi-particle and
quasi-hole excitations. Furthermore, it yields the emergence of damped
resonance states, which exponentially decay during propagation in space. We
argue that such resonance states correspond to excitations of the Bose-glass
phase.

<h3>Preserving Metamagnetism in Self-Assembled FeRh Nanomagnets</h3>

<br>
We present self-assembly routes of metamagnetic FeRh nanoisland arrays using
sputter deposition processing. Controlling the growth parameters and epitaxy
allows tuning the size and shape of the FeRh nanoislands. While the phase
transition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order is largely
suppressed in nanoislands formed on oxide substrates via thermodynamic
nucleation, we find that metamagnetism is largely preserved in nanomagnet
arrays formed through solid-state dewetting. This behavior is strongly
dependent on the resulting crystal faceting of the nanoislands, which is
characteristic of each assembly route. Comparing the calculated surface
energies for each magnetic phase of the nanoislands reveals that metamagnetism
can be suppressed or allowed by specific geometrical configurations of the
facets. Furthermore, we find that the spatial confinement leads to very
pronounced supercooling and the absence of phase separation in the nanoislands.
Finally, the supported nanomagnets are chemically etched away from the
substrates to inspect the phase transition properties of self-standing
nanoparticles. We demonstrate that solid-state dewetting is a feasible and
scalable way to obtain supported and free-standing FeRh nanomagnets with
preserved metamagnetism.

<h3>Fabric-based star soft robotic gripper</h3>

<br>
<i>Ignacio Andrade-Silva, Joel Marthelot</i>
<br>
Soft pneumatic gripping strategies are often based on pressurized actuation
of structures made of soft elastomeric materials, which limits designs in terms
of size, weight, achievable forces, and ease of fabrication. On the other hand,
fabric-based inflatable structures offer high stiffness-to-weight ratio
solutions for soft robotics, but their actuation has been little explored. Here
we present a new class of pneumatic soft grippers that exploits the in-plane
over-curvature effect of inextensible fabric flat balloons upon inflation. Our
gripper has a star shape that contracts radially under pressure producing a
gripping force on the object whose intensity can be modulated by the pressure
input. We first focus on the kinematics and mechanics of a single V-shaped
actuator through experiments, finite element simulations, and analytical
models. We then leverage these results to predict the mechanical response of
the entire star, optimize its geometry, and maximize contraction and stiffness.
We demonstrate that the gripping force can be increased by stacking multiple
stars in a rigid frame. We expect that the flexibility, robustness, scalability
and ease of fabrication of our methodology will lead to a new generation of
lighter and larger actuators capable of developing higher forces and moving
delicate and irregularly shaped objects while maintaining reasonable
complexity.

<h3>Polarization jumps by breaking symmetries of two-dimensional Weyl  semimetals</h3>

<br>
The electric polarization as a bulk quantity is described by the modern
theory of polarization in insulating systems and cannot be defined in
conducting systems. Upon a gradual change of a parameter in the system, the
polarization always varies smoothly as long as the gap remains open. In this
paper, we focus on the two-dimensional Weyl semimetal, which hosts Weyl nodes
protected by symmetries, and study the behavior of the polarization when a
symmetry-breaking term $M$ is introduced and a gap opens. We show that there
can be a jump between $M\to0^+$ and $M\to0^-$ limits. We find that the jump is
universally described by the ``Weyl dipole" representing how the Weyl nodes
with monopole charges are displaced in the reciprocal space. Our result is
applicable to general two-dimensional Weyl semimetals.

<i>Carolina Herrera Segura, Edison Montoya, Diego Tapias</i>
<br>
We consider a simple classification problem to show that the dynamics of
finite-width Deep Neural Networks in the underparametrized regime gives rise to
effects similar to those associated with glassy systems, namely a slow
evolution of the loss function and aging. Remarkably, the aging is sublinear in
the waiting time (subaging) and the power-law exponent characterizing it is
robust to different architectures under the constraint of a constant total
number of parameters. Our results are maintained in the more complex scenario
of the MNIST database. We find that for this database there is a unique
exponent ruling the subaging behavior in the whole phase.

<h3>Network model for periodically strained graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Christophe De Beule, Vo Tien Phong, E. J. Mele</i>
<br>
The long-wavelength physics of monolayer graphene in the presence of periodic
strain fields has a natural chiral scattering network description. When the
strain field varies slowly compared to the graphene lattice and the effective
magnetic length of the induced valley pseudomagnetic field, the low-energy
physics can be understood in terms of valley-polarized percolating domain-wall
modes. Inspired by a recent experiment, we consider a strain field with
threefold rotation and mirror symmetries but without twofold rotation symmetry,
resulting in a system with the connectivity of the oriented kagome network.
Scattering processes in this network are captured by a symmetry-constrained
phenomenological $S$ matrix. We analyze the phase diagram of the kagome
network, and show that the bulk physics of the strained graphene can be
qualitatively captured by the network when the $S$ matrix gains an appropriate
energy dependence. We also discuss the limitations of this approach to properly
account for boundary physics.

Inspired by Analogue Gravity, superradiance has been previously investigated
in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). In this work, we revisit this problem by
introducing dissipation to the system. After establishing the possibility of
quantum vortices in dissipative BECs, we analyze the propagation of elementary
excitations and demonstrate the existence of superradiant modes which can be
interpreted in terms of the dissipation of ``antiparticles". Our findings
support the possibility of superradiant scattering around dissipative quantum
vortices and paves the way for future experimental realization of the
phenomenon.

In this paper, we extend the discrete-to-continuum procedure we developed in
our previous work to derive a continuum variational model for a hexagonal
twisted bilayer material in which one layer is fixed. We use a discrete energy
containing elastic terms and a weak interaction term that could utilize either
a Lennard-Jones potential or a Kolmogorov-Crespi potential. To validate our
modeling, we perform numerical simulations to compare the predictions of the
original discrete model and the proposed continuum model, which also show an
agreement with experimental findings for, e.g., twisted bilayer graphene.

Defects such as voids are observed at multiple length scales of an additively
manufactured composite material. Modeling such defects and their multiscale
interaction is crucial for the materials performance prediction. In this work,
we study as-built defects in fused filament fabricated Polycarbonate/Short
Carbon Fiber (PC/SCF) composite samples. The microscale and mesoscale voids
along with the mesoscale layer orientations have been studied using a
mechanistic reduced-order model. Our result indicates that the microscale
intrabead voids interact with the mesoscale interbead voids and significantly
degrade the mechanical response of the printed composites compared to the
microscale microstructure without voids. The mesoscale layer orientations also
influence the stress-strain response and show better performance when the load
is applied to the bead direction. The efficient reduced-order modeling approach
used in this work provides a way to evaluate multiscale design aspects of
additively manufactured composite materials.

<br>
Mn$_3$Sn is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic quantum material that exhibits
a magnetic Weyl semimetallic state and has great potential for efficient memory
devices. High-quality epitaxial $c$-plane Mn$_3$Sn thin films have been grown
on a sapphire substrate using a Ru seed layer. Using spin pumping induced
inverse spin Hall effect measurements on $c$-plane epitaxial
Mn$_3$Sn/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, we measure spin-diffusion length ($\lambda_{\rm
Mn_3Sn}$), and spin Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{\rm{SH}}$) of Mn$_3$Sn thin
films: $\lambda_{\rm Mn_3Sn}=0.42\pm 0.04$ nm and $\sigma_{\rm{SH}}=-702~\hbar/
e~\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$. While $\lambda_{\rm Mn_3Sn}$ is consistent with
earlier studies, $\sigma_{\rm{SH}}$ is an order of magnitude higher and of the
opposite sign. The behavior is explained on the basis of excess Mn, which
shifts the Fermi level in our films, leading to the observed behavior. Our
findings demonstrate a technique for engineering $\sigma_{\rm{SH}}$ of Mn$_3$Sn
films by employing Mn composition for functional spintronic devices.

<h3>One-dimensional non-interacting topological insulators with chiral  symmetry</h3>

<br>
We construct microscopical models of one-dimensional non-interacting
topological insulators in all of the chiral universality classes. Specifically,
we start with a deformation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model that breaks
time-reversal symmetry, which is in the AIII class. We then couple this model
to its time-reversal counterpart in order to build models in the classes BDI,
CII, DIII and CI. We find that the $\mathbb{Z}$ topological index (the winding
number) in individual chains is defined only up to a sign. This comes from
noticing that changing the sign of the chiral symmetry operator changes the
sign of the winding number. The freedom to choose the sign of the chiral
symmetry operator on each chain independently allows us to construct two
distinct possible chiral symmetry operators when the chains are weakly coupled
-- in one case, the total winding number is given by the sum of the winding
number of individual chains while in the second case, the difference is taken.
We find that the chiral models that belong to $\mathbb{Z}$ classes, AIII, BDI
and CII are topologically equivalent, so they can be adiabatically deformed
into one another so long as the chiral symmetry is preserved. We study the
properties of the edge states in the constructed models and prove that
topologically protected edge states must all be localised on the same
sublattice (on any given edge). We also discuss the role of particle-hole
symmetry on the protection of edge states and explain how it manages to protect
edge states in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classes, where the integer invariant vanishes and
chiral symmetry alone does not protect the edge states anymore. We discuss
applications of our results to the case of an arbitrary number of coupled
chains, construct possible chiral symmetry operators for the multiple chain
case, and briefly discuss the generalisation to any odd number of dimensions.

<br>
We report a series of high-pressure electrical transport, magnetic
susceptibility, and x-ray diffraction measurements on single crystals of the
weak topological insulator Bi2TeI and the topological metal Bi3TeI. Room
temperature x-ray diffraction measurements show that both materials go through
a series of pressure-induced structural transitions and eventually adopt a
disordered bcc alloy structure at high pressure. A re-analysis of the published
data on BiTeI indicates that this material also adopts a disordered bcc
structure at high pressure, in contrast to the previously suggested P4/nmm
structure. We find that Bi2TeI and Bi3TeI become superconducting at 13 GPa and
11.5 GPa, respectively. The superconducting critical temperature Tc of the bcc
phase reaches maximum values of 7 K and 7.5 K for Bi2TeI and Bi3TeI,
respectively and dTc/dP < 0 in both cases. The results indicate that disordered
alloy bcc superconducting phases appear to be a universal feature of both the
Bi-Te and Bi-Te-I systems at high pressure.
