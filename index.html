<h3>A quantum model of charge capture and release onto/from deep traps</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08929" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08929</a>

The rapid development of optical technologies and applications revealed the
critical role of point defects affecting device performance. One of the
powerful tools to study influence of defects on charge capture and
recombination processes is thermoluminescence. The popular models behind
thermoluminescence and carrier capture processes are semi-classic though. They
offer good qualitative description, but implicitly exclude quantum nature of
the accompanying parameters, such as frequency factors and capture cross
sections. As a consequence, results obtained for a specific host material
cannot be successfully extrapolated to other materials. Thus, the main purpose
of our work is to introduce a reliable analytical model that describes
non-radiative capture and release of electrons from/to the conduction band
(CB). The proposed model is governed by Bose-Einstein statistics (for phonon
occupation) and Fermi's golden rule (for resonant charge transfer between the
trap and the CB). The constructed model offers a physical interpretation of the
capture coefficients and frequency factors, and seamlessly includes the Coulomb
neutral/attractive nature of traps. It connects the frequency factor to the
overlap of wavefunctions of the delocalized CB and trap states, and suggests a
strong dependence on the density of charge distribution, i.e. the
ionicity/covalency of the chemical bonds within the host. Separation of the
resonance condition from the accumulation/dissipation of phonons on the site
leads to the conclusion that the capture cross-section does not necessarily
depend on the trap depth. The model is verified by comparison to reported
experimental data, showing good agreement. As such, the model generates
reliable information about trap states whose exact nature is not completely
understood and allows to do materials research in a more systematic way.

<h3>An encounter-based approach to the escape problem</h3>

We revise the encounter-based approach to imperfect diffusion-controlled
reactions, which employs the statistics of encounters between a diffusing
particle and the reactive region to implement surface reactions. We extend this
approach to deal with a more general setting, in which the reactive region is
surrounded by a reflecting boundary with an escape region. We derive a spectral
expansion for the full propagator and investigate the behavior and
probabilistic interpretations of the associated probability flux density. In
particular, we obtain the joint probability density of the escape time and the
number of encounters with the reactive region before escape, and the
probability density of the first-crossing time of a prescribed number of
encounters. We briefly discuss generalizations of the conventional
Poissonian-type surface reaction mechanism described by Robin boundary
condition and potential applications of this formalism in chemistry and
biophysics.

<h3>Eulerian formulation of the constitutive relation for an  electro-magneto-elastic material class</h3>

A novel class of electro-magneto-elastic (EME) materials comprise
electro-active and magneto-active particles in the polymer matrix that change
their elastic behavior with an applied electromagnetic field. The material
response for such a material class is usually formulated in terms of Lagrangian
strain tensor along with Lagrangian electromagnetic field vectors as pushed
forward to the current configuration. This letter article presents a novel
formulation of an electro-magneto-elasticity in terms of an Eulerian strain
tensor and Eulerian electromagnetic field vectors referring to the current
configuration. Such an Eulerian formulation is often favorable from both
theoretical and computational standpoints, which avoids the pushed forward
operation to get the current configuration. Additionally, an exercise to deduce
the constitutive relation for an EME material class available in the existing
literature from the newly proposed relation is also illustrated.

<h3>Active coating of a water drop by an oil film using a MHz-frequency  surface acoustic wave</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09141" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09141</a>
<br>
<i>Avital Reizman, Amihai Horesh, Lou Kondic, Ofer Manor</i>
<br>
<br>
We employ a millimeter-scale piezoelectric acoustic actuator, which generates
MHz-frequency surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in a solid substrate, to actively
coat a drop of water by a macroscopic film of silicon oil as a paradigm for a
small scale and low power coating system. We build upon previous studies on SAW
induced dynamic wetting of a solid substrate, also known as the acoustowetting
phenomena, to actively drive a model low surface-energy liquid -- silicon oil
-- coat a model liquid object -- a sessile drop of water. The oil film spreads
along the path of the propagating SAW and comes in contact with the drop, which
is placed in its path. The intensity of the SAW determines the rate and the
extent to which a macroscopically thick film of oil will climb over the drop to
partially or fully cover its surface. The dynamic wetting of the drop by the
oil film is governed by a balance between acoustic, capillary, and
gravitational contributions. Introducing a water drop as an object to be coated
indicates the opportunity to coat liquid phase objects by employing SAWs and
demonstrates that oil films which are actuated by SAWs may traverse curved
objects and liquid surfaces.

<h3>Sc2CX (X=N2, ON, O2) MXenes as a promising anode material: A  first-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09540" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09540</a>
<br>
<i>S. Özcan, B. Biel</i>
<br>
<br>
MXenes' tunable properties make them excellent candidates for many
applications in future nanoelectronics. In this work, we explore the
suitability of Sc$_2$CX (X=N$_2$, ON, O$_2$) MXenes to act as the active anode
materials in Na-ion based batteries (NIBs) by means of \textsl{ab initio}
simulations. After analyzing the structural and elastic properties of all the
possible models to evaluate the energetically favorable N and O
functionalization sites, our calculations show that both Sc$_2$CON and
Sc$_2$CN$_2$ present a clear metallic character, making them potential
candidates as anode materials. The investigation of the most relevant features
for anode performance, such as the adsorption and diffusion of Na atoms, the
intrinsic capacity, the open circuit voltage, and the storage capacity show
that both systems are serious alternatives to the most common 2D materials
currently employed in alkali metal batteries. In particular, Sc$_2$CN$_2$
presents a better diffusion behavior thanks to the absence of Na clustering on
its surface, with optimal diffusion barriers comparable to other 2D materials
such as MoN$_2$, while the values of diffusion barriers for Sc$_2$CON are at
least three times smaller than those found for other anode candidates.
Similarly, while the capacity of Sc$_2$CON is close to the one reported for 2D
Sc$_2$C, Sc$_2$CN$_2$ possesses a power density more than twice higher than the
ones of 2D materials such as Sc$_2$C, graphite, and MoS$_2$. Our results thus
confirm the urge for further experimental exploration of the MXene Sc$_2$CX
(X=N$_2$, ON, O$_2$) family as anode material in NIBs.

<h3>How cells wrap around virus-like particles using extracellular  filamentous protein structures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08776" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08776</a>

Nanoparticles, such as viruses, can enter cells via endocytosis. During
endocytosis, the cell surface wraps around the nanoparticle to effectively eat
it. Prior focus has been on how nanoparticle size and shape impacts
endocytosis. However, inspired by the noted presence of extracellular vimentin
affecting viral and bacteria uptake, as well as the structure of coronaviruses,
we construct a computational model in which {\it both} the cell-like construct
and the virus-like construct contain filamentous protein structures protruding
from their surfaces. We then study the impact of these additional degrees of
freedom on viral wrapping. We find that cells with an optimal density of
filamentous extracellular components (ECCs) are more likely to be infected as
they uptake the virus faster and use relatively less cell surface area per
individual virus. At the optimal density, the cell surface folds around the
virus, and folds are faster and more efficient at wrapping the virus than
crumple-like wrapping. We also find that cell surface bending rigidity helps
generate folds, as bending rigidity enhances force transmission across the
surface. However, changing other mechanical parameters, such as the stretching
stiffness of filamentous ECCs or virus spikes, can drive crumple-like formation
of the cell surface. We conclude with the implications of our study on the
evolutionary pressures of virus-like particles, with a particular focus on the
cellular microenvironment that may include filamentous ECCs.

<h3>Controlling auxeticity in curved-beam metamaterials via a deep  generative model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08786" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08786</a>

Lattice-based mechanical metamaterials are known to exhibit quite a unique
mechanical behavior owing to their rational internal architecture. This
includes unusual properties such as a negative Poisson's ratio, which can be
easily tuned in reentrant-hexagonal metamaterials by adjusting the angles
between beams. However, changing the angles also affects the overall dimensions
of the unit cell. We show that by replacing traditional straight beams with
curved ones, it is possible to control Poisson's ratio of reentrant-hexagonal
metamaterials without affecting their overall dimensions. While the mechanical
properties of these structures can be predicted through finite element
simulations or, in some cases, analytically, many applications require to
identify architectures with specific target properties. To solve this inverse
problem, we introduce a deep learning framework for generating metamaterials
with desired properties. By supplying the generative model with a guide
structure in addition to the target properties, we are not only able to
generate a large number of alternative architectures with the same properties,
but also to express preference for a specific shape. Deep learning predictions
together with experimental measurements prove that this approach allows us to
accurately generate unit cells fitting specific properties for curved-beam
metamaterials.

High-throughput data generation methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms
have given rise to a new era of computational materials science by learning
relationships among composition, structure, and properties and by exploiting
such relations for design. However, to build these connections, materials data
must be translated into a numerical form, called a representation, that can be
processed by a machine learning model. Datasets in materials science vary in
format (ranging from images to spectra), size, and fidelity. Predictive models
vary in scope and property of interests. Here, we review context-dependent
strategies for constructing representations that enable the use of materials as
inputs or outputs of machine learning models. Furthermore, we discuss how
modern ML techniques can learn representations from data and transfer chemical
and physical information between tasks. Finally, we outline high-impact
questions that have not been fully resolved and thus, require further
investigation.

<h3>Moiré patterns and inversion boundaries in graphene/hexagonal boron  nitride bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08820</a>
<br>

<br>
In this paper a systematic examination of graphene/hexagonal boron nitride
(g/hBN) bilayers is presented, through a recently developed two-dimensional
phase field crystal model that incorporates out-of-plane deformations. The
system parameters are determined by closely matching the stacking energies and
heights of graphene/hBN bilayers to those obtained from existing
quantum-mechanical density functional theory calculations. Out-of-plane
deformations are shown to reduce the energies of inversion domain boundaries in
hBN, and the coupling between graphene and hBN layers leads to a bilayer defect
configuration consisting of an inversion boundary in hBN and a domain wall in
graphene. Simulations of twisted bilayers reveal the structure, energy, and
elastic properties of the corresponding Moir\'e patterns, and show a crossover,
as the misorientation angle between the layers increases, from a well-defined
hexagonal network of domain boundaries and junctions to smeared-out patterns.
The transition occurs when the thickness of domain walls approaches the size of
the Moir\'e patterns, and coincides with the peaks in the average von Mises and
volumetric stresses of the bilayer.

<h3>Electron Doping of a Double Perovskite Flat-band System</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electronic structure calculations indicate that the Sr2FeSbO6 double
perovskite has a flat-band set just above the Fermi level that includes
contributions from ordinary sub-bands with weak kinetic electron hopping plus a
flat sub-band that can be attributed to the lattice geometry and orbital
interference. To place the Fermi energy in that flat band, electron doped
samples with formulas Sr2-xLaxFeSbO6 (0 < x < 0.3) were synthesized and their
magnetism and ambient temperature crystal structures determined by
high-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. All materials appear to
display an antiferromagnetic-like maximum in the magnetic susceptibility, but
the dominant spin coupling evolves from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic on
electron doping. Which of the three sub-bands or combinations is responsible
for the behavior has not been determined.

<h3>Second Euler number in four dimensional synthetic matter</h3>

Two-dimensional Euler insulators are novel kind of systems that host
multi-gap topological phases, quantified by a quantised first Euler number in
their bulk. Recently, these phases have been experimentally realised in
suitable two-dimensional synthetic matter setups. Here we introduce the second
Euler invariant, a familiar invariant in both differential topology
(Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem) and in four-dimensional Euclidean gravity, whose
existence has not been explored in condensed matter systems. Specifically, we
firstly define two specific novel models in four dimensions that support a
non-zero second Euler number in the bulk together with peculiar gapless
boundary states. Secondly, we discuss its robustness in general
spacetime-inversion invariant phases and its role in the classification of
topological degenerate real bands through real Grassmannians. In particular, we
derive from homotopy arguments the minimal Bloch Hamiltonian form from which
the tight-binding models of any second Euler phase can be generated.
Considering more concretely the gapped Euler phase associated with the tangent
bundle of the four-sphere, we show that the bulk band structure of the
nontrivial 4D Euler phase necessarily exhibits triplets of linked nodal
surfaces (where the three types of nodal surfaces are formed by the crossing of
the three successive pairs of bands within one four-band subspace). Finally, we
show how to engineer these new topological phases in a four-dimensional
ultracold atom setup. Our results naturally generalize the second Chern and
spin Chern numbers to the case of four-dimensional phases that are
characterised by real Hamiltonians and open doors for implementing such
unexplored higher-dimensional phases in artificial engineered systems, ranging
from ultracold atoms to photonics and electric circuits.

<h3>Nanofluidics at the crossroads</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08829</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Robin, Lydéric Bocquet</i>
<br>
<br>
Nanofluidics, the field interested in flows at the smallest scales, has grown
at a fast pace, reaching an ever finer control offluidic and ionic transport at
the molecular level. Still, artificial pores are far from reaching the wealth
of functionalities of biological channels that regulate sensory detection,
biological transport and neurostransmission - all while operating at energies
comparable to thermal noise. Here, we argue that artificial ionic machinescan
be designed by harnessing the entire wealth of phenomena available at the
nanoscales and exploiting techniques developped in various fields of physics.
As they are generally based on solid-state nanopores, rather than soft
membranes and proteins, they should in particular aim at taking advantage of
their specific properties such as their electronic structure or their ability
to interact with light. These observations call for the design of new ways of
probing nanofluidic systems. Nanofluidics is now at the crossroads, there are
new avenues to build complex ionic machines and this may allow to develop new
functionalities inspired by Nature.

<h3>Spectral statistics of non Hermitian multiparametric Gaussian random  matrix ensembles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08850" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08850</a>
<br>
<i>Mohd. Gayas Ansari, Pragya Shukla</i>
<br>
<br>
A statistical description of part of a many body system often requires a
non-Hermitian random matrix ensemble with nature and strength of randomness
sensitive to underlying system conditions. This in turn makes its necessary to
analyze a wide range of multi-parametric ensembles with different kinds of
matrix elements distributions. The spectral statistics of such ensembles is not
only system-dependent but also non-ergodic as well as non-"stationary'" This
motivates us to theoretically analyze the evolution of the ensemble averaged
spectral density on the complex plane as well as its local fluctuations with
changing system conditions. Our analysis, based on the complexity parameter
formulation, reveals the existence of a critical statistics as well as hidden
universality in non-ergodic regime of spectral fluctuations. Another important
insight given by our analysis is about the similarity of the evolution equation
for the spectral angles correlations to that of a circular Brownian ensemble;
the detailed existing information about the latter can then be applied to
determine those of the former.

<h3>Resolving the discrepancy between MOKE measurements at 1550-nm  wavelength on Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08853" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08853</a>
<br>
<i>Jingyuan Wang, Camron Farhang, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Jing Xia</i>
<br>
<br>
Kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Cs, Rb) provide a rich platform for intertwined
orders, where evidence for time-reversal symmetry breaking possibly due to the
long-sought loop currents has emerged in muSR and MOKE experiments.
Intriguingly, the observed spontaneous MOKE signals differ by orders of
magnitude between different wavelengths, and more oddly, within the same
wavelength. Here we perform comprehensive 1550 nm MOKE measurements on CsV3Sb5
under respective experimental conditions in prior reports. The results are
consistent with Stanford and Irvine but differ in sign and size from Kyoto
under identical conditions. The opposite behaviors of MOKE susceptibility under
identical magnetic fields indicate different magnetic configurations between
samples, which we conclude is the only remaining plausible explanation for the
discrepancy in 1550 nm MOKE results.

<h3>Hard Ferromagnets as a New Perspective on Materials for Thermomagnetic  Power Generation Cycles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08854" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08854</a>
<br>
<i>Anthony N. Tantillo, Alexander Barcza, Volker Zellmann, Vittorio Basso, Martino LoBue, Nora M. Dempsey, Karl G. Sandeman</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the ways in which magnetically hard materials can be used as the
working materials in thermomagnetic power generation (TMG) cycles in order to
expand the area in the magnetisation vs. applied field ($M-H$) plane available
for energy conversion. There are 3 parts to this Perspective. First,
experiments on commercially available hard ferrites reveal that, while these
materials are not yet good TMG candidates, hard ferromagnets with higher
thermal conductivity and a greater change of magnetization with temperature
could outperform existing TMG materials. Second, computational results indicate
that biasing a soft magnet with a hard ferromagnet is essentially equivalent to
shifting the $M-H$ loop by an amount proportional to the field of the biasing
magnet. Work outputs under biased conditions show a substantial improvement
over unbiased cycles, but experimental verification is needed. Third, we
discuss the rationale for exploring artificial spin reorientation materials as
novel TMG working materials.

<h3>Replica theory for disorder-free spin-lattice glass transition on a  tree-like simplex network</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08884" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08884</a>

<i>Kota Mitsumoto, Hajime Yoshino</i>
<br>
<br>
A class of pyrochlore oxides, $A_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ ($A =$ Ho, Y, Dy, Tb) with
magnetic ions on corner-sharing tetrahedra is known to exhibit spin-glass
transitions without appreciable amount of quenched disorder. Recently a
disorder-free theoretical model for such a system has been proposed which takes
into account not only spins but also lattice distortions as dynamical variables
[K. Mitsumoto, C. Hotta and H. Yoshino, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 087201 (2020)].
In the present paper we develop and analyze an exactly solvable disorder-free
mean-field model which is a higher-dimensional counterpart of the model. We
find the system exhibit complex free-energy landscape accompanying replica
symmetry breaking through the spin-lattice coupling.

<h3>Realization of a quantum degenerate mixture of highly-magnetic and  nonmagnetic atoms</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report on the experimental realization of a bosonic quantum degenerate
mixture of highly-magnetic 168Er and nonmagnetic 174Yb. Quantum degeneracy is
reached by forced evaporation in an all-optical trap. Formation of the two
Bose-Einstein condensates is confirmed by analysis of the cloud shape and the
observed inversions of the aspect ratios. The results open a path for new
experiments on magnetic and nonmagnetic impurity physics as well as on the
quantum chaotic behavior of Feshbach resonances and their dependencies on minor
variations of the reduced masses.

<h3>Pattern description of the ground state properties of the  one-dimensional axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising model in a transverse field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08891" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08891</a>
<br>
<i>Yun-Tong Yang, Hong-Gang Luo</i>
<br>
<br>
The description and understanding of the consequences of competing
interactions in various systems, both classical and quantum, are notoriously
difficult due to insufficient information involved in conventional concepts,
for example, order parameters and/or correlation functions. Here we go beyond
these conventional language and present a pattern picture to describe and
understand the frustration physics by taking the one-dimensional (1D) axial
next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model in a transverse field as an example.
The system is dissected by the patterns, obtained by diagnonalizing the model
Hamiltonian in an operator space with a finite lattice size $4n$ ($n$: natural
number) and periodic boundary condition. With increasing the frustration
parameter, the system experiences successively various phases/metastates,
identified respectively as those with zero, two, four, $\cdots$, $2n$
domains/kinks, where the first is the ferromagnetic phase and the last the
antiphase. Except for the ferromagnetic phase and antiphase, the others should
be metastates, whose transitions are crossing over in nature. The results
clarify the controversial issues about the phases in the 1D ANNNI model and
provide a starting point to study more complicated situations, for example, the
frustration systems in high dimensions.

<h3>Exploring the potential of GeTe for the application in  Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell</h3>

Germanium telluride (GeTe) having a direct bandgap of 0.6 eV has mainly been
in phase change memory and thermoelectric power generation. In this article, we
study the electronic structure of the GeTe by first-principles calculations.
The theoretical direct bandgap of GeTe was found to be 0.69 eV which is very
close to the experimental value. Then, we demonstrate a single-junction GeTe
thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell based on device transport model with np
structure. The device was optimized for the higher performance of the TPV cell.
The GeTe TPV cell exhibited an efficiency of 7.9% with JSC=16.16 A/cm2,
VOC=0.360 V and FF=75.51%, respectively. These results indicate that GeTe could
be a promising material for the fabrication of efficient TPV cell.

<h3>Revelation of Mott insulating state in layered honeycomb lattice  Li$_2$RuO$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08905" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08905</a>
<br>
<i>Sakshi Bansal, Asif Ali, B. H. Reddy, Ravi Shankar Singh</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the role of electron correlation in the electronic structure
of honeycomb lattice Li$_2$RuO$_3$ using photoemission spectroscopy and band
structure calculations. Monoclinic Li$_2$RuO$_3$ having Ru network as honeycomb
lattice undergoes magneto-structural transition at T$_c$ $\sim$ 540 K from high
temperature phase $C2/m$ to low temperature dimerized phase $P2_1/m$. Room
temperature valence band photoemission spectra reveal an insulating ground
state with no intensity at Fermi level ($E_F$). Ru 4$d$ band extracted from
high and low photon energy valence band photoemission spectra reveal that the
surface and bulk electronic structures are very similar in this system. Band
structure calculations using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) leads to
metallic ground state while screened hybrid (YS-PBE0) functional reveals
opening up of a gap in almost degenerate $d_{zx}$/$d_{yz}$ orbital, whereas
$d_{xy}$ orbital is already gapped. Ru 3$d$ core level spectra with prominent
unscreened feature provides direct evidence of strong electron correlation
among Ru 4$d$ electrons which is also manifested by $|E-E_F|^2$ dependence of
spectral density of states (DOS) in the vicinity of $E_F$ in the
high-resolution spectra, establishing Li$_2$RuO$_3$ as Mott insulator.

We study the surface criticality of a three-dimensional classical
antiferromagnetic Potts model, whose bulk critical behaviors belongs to the XY
model because of emergent O(2) symmetry. We find that the surface
antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighboring interactions can drive the
extraordinary-log phase to the ordinary phase, the transition between the two
phases belongs to the universality class of the well-known special transition
of the XY model. Further strengthening the surface next-nearest neighboring
interactions, the extraordinary-log phase reappears, but the main critical
behaviors are dominated on the sublattices of the model; the special point
between the ordinary phase and the sublattice extraordinary-log phase belongs
to a new universality class.

Magnetic materials exhibiting topological Dirac fermions are attracting
significant attention for their promising technological potential in
spintronics. In these systems, the combined effect of the spin-orbit coupling
and magnetic order enables the realization of novel topological phases with
exotic transport properties, including the anomalous Hall effect and
magneto-chiral phenomena. Herein, we report experimental signature of
topological Dirac antiferromagnetism in TaCoTe2 via angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, we find the existence of spin-orbit
coupling-induced gaps at the Fermi level, consistent with the manifestation of
a large intrinsic non-linear Hall conductivity. Remarkably, we find that the
latter is extremely sensitive to the orientation of the N\'eel vector,
suggesting TaCoTe2 a suitable candidate for the realization of non-volatile
spintronic devices with an unprecedented level of intrinsic tunability.

The optical response of a matter excitation embedded in nanophotonic devices
is commonly described by the Drude-Lorentz model. Here, we demonstrate that
this widely used approach fails in the case where quantum-confined plasmons of
a two-dimensional electron gas interact strongly with optical phonons. We
propose a new quantum model which contains the semiclassical Drude-Lorentz one
for simple electronic potentials, but predicts very different results in
symmetry-broken potentials. We unveil a new mechanism for the oscillator
strength transfer between bright phonon-polariton and dark plasmon modes,
enabling thus new quantum degrees of freedom for designing the optical response
of nanostructures.

Heterovalent substitution of toxic lead is an increasingly popular design
strategy to obtain environmentally sustainable variants of the exciting
material class of halide perovskites. Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) obtained
through solution-based methods exhibit exceedingly high optical quality.
Unfortunately, most of these synthesis routes still require reaction under
inert gas and at very high temperatures. Herein we present a novel synthesis
routine for lead-free double perovskite NCs. We combine hot injection and
ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) methods to achieve a low-temperature and
ambient atmosphere-based synthesis for manganese-doped Cs_{2}NaBiCl_{6} NCs. Mn
incorporation is critical for the otherwise non-emissive material, with a 9:1
Bi:Mn precursor ratio maximizing the bright orange photoluminescence (PL) and
quantum yield (QY). Higher temperatures slightly increased the material's
performance, yet NCs synthesized at room temperature were still emissive,
highlighting the versatility of the synthetic approach. Furthermore, the NCs
show excellent long-term stability in ambient conditions, facilitating
additional investigations and energy-related applications.

Using first-principles calculations, we study the structural and electronic
properties of the bilayer SnS/graphene, bilayer SnS/bilayer graphene
(AA-stacked), bilayer SnS/bilayer graphene (AB-stacked) and monolayer
SnS/graphene/monolayer SnS van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Electronic
properties of all components of the vdW heterostructures are well preserved,
which reflects the weakness of the vdW interaction. In the cases of bilayer
SnS/graphene and bilayer SnS/bilayer graphene (AA-stacked), an Ohmic contact is
formed which can be turned first into p-type and then into n-type Schottky
contacts via application of an external electric field. Calculations show that
an Ohmic contact is also formed at the interface of bilayer SnS/bilayer
graphene (AB-stacked) heterostructure, but interestingly, by applying the
perpendicular electric field a transition from semimetal/semiconductor contact
to semiconductor/semiconductor one occurs which can enhance its optical
properties. Alternatively, in the monolayer SnS/graphene/monolayer SnS vdW
heterosructure, a p-type Schottky contact is established that changes into
Ohmic contact under an applied electric field. Our results clearly indicate
that the electronic properties of the vdW heterostructures can be tuned
efficiently by external electric field, which is important in designing of new
nanoelectronic devices.

<br>
<br>
Interatomic forces that bind materials are largely determined by an often
complex interplay between the electronic band-structure and the atomic
arrangements to form its equilibrium structure and dynamics. As these forces
also determine the phonon dispersion, lattice dynamics measurements are often
crucial tools for understanding how materials transform between different
structures. This is the case for the mono-chalcogenides which feature a number
of lattice instabilities associated with their network of resonant bonds and a
large tunability in their functional properties. SnSe hosts a novel lattice
instability upon above-bandgap photoexcitation that is distinct from the
distortions associated with its high temperature phase transition,
demonstrating that photoexcitation can alter the interatomic forces
significantly different than thermal excitation. Here we report decisive
time-resolved X-ray scattering-based measurements of the nonequlibrium lattice
dynamics in SnSe. By fitting interatomic force models to the excited-state
dispersion, we determine this instability as being primarily due to changes in
the fourth-nearest neighbor bonds that connect bilayers, with relatively little
change to the intralayer resonant bonds. In addition to providing critical
insight into the nonthermal bonding origin of the instability in SnSe, such
measurements will be crucial for understanding and controlling materials
properties under non-equilibrium conditions.

Spectro-ptychography offers improved spatial resolution and additional phase
spectral information relative to that provided by scanning transmission X-ray
microscopes (STXM). However, carrying out ptychography at the lower range of
soft X-ray energies (e.g., below 200 eV to 600 eV) on samples with weakly
scattering signals can be challenging. We present soft X-ray ptychography
results at energies as low as 180 eV and illustrate the capabilities with
results from permalloy nanorods (Fe 2p), carbon nanotubes (C 1s), and boron
nitride bamboo nanostructures (B 1s, N1s). We describe optimization of low
energy X-ray spectro-ptychography and discuss important challenges associated
with measurement approaches, reconstruction algorithms, and their effects on
the reconstructed images. A method for evaluating the increase in radiation
dose when using overlapping sampling is presented.

In the last decade the Fick-Jacobs approximation has been exploited to
capture the transport across constrictions. Here, we review the derivation of
the Fick-Jacobs equation with particular emphasis on its linear response
regime. We show that for fore-aft symmetric channels the flux of
non-interacting systems is fully captured by its linear response regime. For
this case we derive a very simple formula that captures the correct trends and
that can be exploited as a simple tool to design experiments or simulations.
Finally, we show that higher order corrections in the flux may appear for
non-symmetric channels.

<h3>Water diffusion in carbon nanotubes for rigid and flexible models</h3>

We compared the diffusion of water confined in armchair and zigzag carbon
nanotubes for rigid and flexible water models. Using one rigid model,
TIP4P/2005, and two flexible models, SPC/Fw and SPC/FH, we found that the
number of the number of hydrogen bonds that water forms depends on the
structure of the nanotube, directly affecting the diffusion of water. The
simulation results reveal that due to the hydrophobic nature of carbon
nanotubes and the degrees of freedom imposed by the water force fields, water
molecules tend to avoid the surface of the carbon nanotube. This junction of
variables plays a central role in the diffusion of water, mainly in narrow
and/or deformed nanotubes, governing the mobility of confined water in a
non-trivial way, where the greater the degree of freedom of the water force
field, the smaller it will be mobility in confinement, as we limit the
competition between area/volume, and it no longer plays the unique role in
changing water diffusivity.

<h3>Power law hopping of single particles in one-dimensional non-Hermitian  quasicrystals</h3>

<br>

In this paper, a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law
hoppings ($1/s^{a}$) and quasiperiodic parameter $\beta$ is studied, where $a$
is the power-law index, $s$ is the hopping distance, and $\beta$ is a member of
the metallic mean family. We find that under the weak non-Hermitian effect,
there preserves $P_{\ell=1,2,3,4}$ regimes where the fraction of ergodic
eigenstates is $\beta$-dependent as $\beta^{\ell}$L ($L$ is the system size)
similar to those in the Hermitian case. However, $P_{\ell}$ regimes are ruined
by the strong non-Hermitian effect. Moreover, by analyzing the fractal
dimension, we find that there are two types of edges aroused by the power-law
index $a$ in the single-particle spectrum, i.e., an ergodic-to-multifractal
edge for the long-range hopping case ($a<1$), and an ergodic-to-localized edge
for the short-range hopping case ($a>1$). Meanwhile, the existence of these two
types of edges is found to be robust against the non-Hermitian effect. By
employing the Simon-Spence theory, we analyzed the absence of the localized
states for $a<1$. For the short-range hopping case, with the Avila's global
theory and the Sarnak method, we consider a specific example with $a=2$ to
reveal the presence of the intermediate phase and to analytically locate the
intermediate regime and the ergodic-to-multifractal edge, which are
self-consistent with the numerically results.

Multi-hydrogen lanthanum hydrides have shown the highest critical temperature
$T_c$ at 250-260 K under 170-200 GPa. However, such high pressure is a great
challenge for sample preparation and practical application. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel design strategy for high-$T_c$ superconductors by
constructing new few-hydrogen metal-bonded perovskite hydrides at ambient
pressure, such as $\rm {Al_4H}$, with better ductility than the well-known
multi-hydrogen, cuprate and iron-based superconductors. Based on the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory, we predict that the structurally stable $\rm {Al_4H}$
has a favorable high $T_c$ up to 54 K under atmospheric pressure, similar to
SmOFeAs.

A theoretical study is reported on the origin of extremely high upper
critical field $\sim$70T observed in UTe$_2$ with the transition temperature
T$_{\rm c}$=1.6K-2K, far exceeding the conventional orbital depairing limit set
by the Fermi velocity and T$_{\rm c}$ for a superconductor (SC) in the clean
limit. We investigate possible violation of the orbital limit in terms of a
spin-triplet nonunitary state, which is effectively coupled to the underlying
magnetization induced by external field. This in turn produces the reduced
internal field by cancelling it via magnetization. We formulate a theory within
Ginzburg-Landau framework to describe this orbital limit violation and analyze
experimental data on the upper critical fields for various field orientations
in UTe$_2$. It is pointed out that the orbital limit violation for a
spin-triplet SC together with the Pauli-Clogston limit violation for a
spin-singlet SC constitutes a complete and useful framework to examine the high
field physics in superconductors in the clean limit.

Elucidating collective dynamics in crystalline systems is a common scientific
question in multiple fields. In this work, by combination of high-precision
numerical approach and analytical normal mode analysis, we systematically
investigate the dynamical response of two-dimensional Lennard-Jones crystal as
a purely classical mechanical system under random disturbance of varying
strength, and reveal rich microscopic dynamics. Specifically, we observe highly
symmetric velocity field composed of sharply divided coherent and disordered
regions, and identify the order-disorder dynamical transition of the velocity
field. Under stronger disturbance, we reveal the vacancy-driven shattering of
the crystal. This featured disruption mode is fundamentally different from the
dislocation-unbinding scenario in two-dimensional melting. We also examine the
healing dynamics associated with vacancies of varying size. The results in this
work advance our understanding about the formation of collective dynamics and
crystal disruption, and may have implications in elucidating relevant
non-equilibrium behaviors in a host of crystalline systems.

When a magnetic moment is embedded in a metal, it captures itinerant
electrons to form the Kondo cloud1,2, which can spread out over a few
micrometres3,4. For a metal with dense magnetic impurities such that Kondo
clouds overlap with each other, correlated ground states are formed. When the
impurities form a regular lattice, the result is a heavy fermion or
anti-ferromagnetic order depending on the dominant interaction5,6. Even in the
case of random impurities, overlapping Kondo clouds are expected to form a
coherent ground state. Here, we examine this issue by performing electrical
transport and high-precision tunnelling density-of-states (DOS) spectroscopy
measurements in a highly P-doped crystalline silicon metal where
disorder-induced localized magnetic moments exist7. We detect the Kondo effect
in the resistivity of the Si metal below 2 K and an exotic pseudogap in the DOS
with gap edge peaks at a Fermi energy below 100 mK. The DOS gap and peaks are
tuned by applying an external magnetic field and transformed into a metallic
Altshuler-Aronov gap8 in the paramagnetic disordered Fermi liquid (DFL) phase.
We interpret this phenomenon as the Kondo condensation, the formation of a
correlated ground state of overlapping Kondo clouds, and its transition to a
DFL. The boundary between the Kondo condensation and DFL phases is identified
by analysing distinct DOS spectra in the magnetic field-temperature plane. A
detailed theoretical analysis using a holographic method 9 , 10 , 11 reproduces
the unusual DOS spectra, 1, supporting our scenario. Our work demonstrates the
observation of the magnetic version of Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) pair
condensation and will be useful for understanding complex Kondo systems.

Here we report the discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in
quasi-one-dimensional $\mathrm{Ta}_2 \mathrm{PdSe}_6$, through a combination of
electrical transport, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and theoretical
calculations. Our transport measurements show that the superconductivity
appears at a critical pressure $P_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 18.3$ GPa and is robust
upon further compression up to $62.6$ GPa. The estimated upper critical field
$\mu_0 H_{\mathrm{c} 2}(0)$ in the pressurized $\mathrm{Ta}_2 \mathrm{PdSe}_6$
is much lower than the Pauli limiting field, in contrast to the case in its
isostructural analogs $M_2 \mathrm{Pd}_{\mathrm{x}} X_5$ $(M=\mathrm{Nb}$, Ta;
$X=\mathrm{S}, \mathrm{Se})$. Concomitant with the occurrence of
superconductivity, anomalies in pressuredependent transport properties are
observed, including sign reversal of Hall coefficient, abnormally enhanced
resistance, and dramatically suppressed magnetoresistance. Meanwhile,
room-temperature synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments reveal the stability
of the pristine monoclinic structure (space group $C 2 / m$ ) upon compression.
Combined with the density functional theory calculations, we argue that a
pressure-induced Lifshitz transition could be the electronic origin of the
emergent superconductivity in $\mathrm{Ta}_2 \mathrm{PdSe}_6$.

This paper presents a novel modeling framework to generate an optimal
microstructure having ultimate multifunctionality using a diffusion-based
generative model. In computational material science, generating microstructure
is a crucial step in understanding the relationship between the microstructure
and properties. However, using finite element (FE)-based direct numerical
simulation (DNS) of microstructure for multiscale analysis is extremely
resource-intensive, particularly in iterative calculations. To address this
time-consuming issue, this study employs a diffusion-based generative model as
a replacement for computational analysis in design optimization. The model
learns the geometry of microstructure and corresponding stress contours,
allowing for the prediction of microstructural behavior based solely on
geometry, without the need for additional analysis. The focus on this work is
on mechanoluminescence (ML) particulate composites made with europium ions and
dysprosium ions. Multi-objective optimization is conducted based on the
generative diffusion model to improve light sensitivity and fracture toughness.
The results show multiple candidates of microstructure that meet the design
requirements. Furthermore, the designed microstructure is not present in the
training data but generates new morphology following the characteristics of
particulate composites. The proposed approach provides a new way to
characterize a performance-based microstructure of composite materials.

Hybrid quantum systems based on magnetic platforms have witnessed the birth
and fast development of quantum spintronics. Until now, most of the studies
rely on magnetic excitations in low-damping magnetic insulators, particularly
yttrium iron garnet, while a large class of magnetic systems is ruled out in
this interdisciplinary field. Here we propose the generation of a magnon bundle
in a hybrid magnet-qubit system, where two or more magnons are emitted
simultaneously. By tuning the driving frequency of qubit to match the detuning
between magnon and qubit mode, one can effectively generate a magnon bundle via
super-Rabi oscillations. In contrast with general wisdom, magnetic dissipation
plays an enabling role in generating the magnon bundle, where the relaxation
time of magnons determines the typical time delay between two successive
magnons. The maximal damping that allows an antibunched magnon bundle can reach
the order of 0.1, which may break the monopoly of low-dissipation magnetic
insulators in quantum spintronics and enables a large class of magnetic
materials for quantum manipulation. Further, our finding may provide a scalable
and generic platform to study multi-magnon physics and benefit the design of
magnonic networks for quantum information processing.

A quantum spin Hall strip where different edges are contacted by $s$-wave
superconductors with a phase difference $\phi$ supports Majorana Kramers pairs
(MKPs). We study the transport properties of this setup in a four-terminal
normal metal (N)/insulator (I)/superconductor (S) and S/I/S junction. The
tunneling spectroscopy for the N/I/S junction reveals that the signature of
MKPs is that the conductance is quantized by $4e^2/h$ at zero bias and
suppressed at the gap edges. In the S/I/S junction, the subharmonic gap
structure displays a phase-tuned even-odd effect, where all odd spikes
disappear in the presence of MKPs and the remaining even spikes split when
superconductors forming the junction have different gaps. We explain these
features by showing that midgap bound states enhance the transmission of the
even order multiple Andreev reflections, while the reduced density of states at
the gap edges suppresses the odd order ones.

Van der Waals magnetic materials are building blocks for novel kinds of
spintronic devices and playgrounds for exploring collective magnetic phenomena
down to the two-dimensional limit. Chromium-tellurium compounds are relevant in
this perspective. In particular, the 1$T$ phase of CrTe$_2$ has been argued to
have a Curie temperature above 300~K, a rare and desirable property in the
class of lamellar materials, making it a candidate for practical applications.
However, recent literature reveals a strong variability in the reported
properties, including magnetic ones. Using electron microscopy, diffraction and
spectroscopy techniques, together with local and macroscopic magnetometry
approaches, our work sheds new light on the structural, chemical and magnetic
properties of bulk 1$T$-CrTe$_2$ exfoliated in the form of flakes having a
thickness ranging from few to several tens of nanometers. We unambiguously
establish that 1$T$-CrTe$_2$ flakes are ferromagnetic above room temperature,
have an in-plane easy axis of magnetization, low coercivity, and we confirm
that their Raman spectroscopy signatures are two modes, $E_{2\text{g}}$
(103.5~cm$^{-1}$) and $A_{1\text{g}}$ (136.5~cm$^{-1}$). We also prove that
thermal annealing causes a phase transformation to monoclinic Cr$_5$Te$_8$ and,
to a lesser extent, to trigonal Cr$_5$Te$_8$. In sharp contrast with
1$T$-CrTe$_2$, none of these compounds have a Curie temperature above room
temperature, and they both have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our findings
reconcile the apparently conflicting reports in the literature and open
opportunities for phase-engineered magnetic properties.

We investigate the finite-size scaling of the entanglement gap in the one
dimensional long-range quantum spherical model (QSM). We focus on the weak
long-range QSM, for which the thermodynamic limit is well-defined. This model
exhibits a continuous phase transition, separating a paramagnetic from a
ferromagnet phase. The universality class of the transition depends on the
long-range exponent $\alpha$. We show that in the thermodynamic limit the
entanglement gap is finite in the paramagnetic phase, and it vanishes in the
ferromagnetic phase. In the ferromagnetic phase the entanglement gap is
understood in terms of standard magnetic correlation functions. The
entanglement gap decays as $\delta\xi\simeq C_\alpha L^{-(1/2-\alpha/4)}$,
where the constant $C_\alpha$ depends on the low-energy properties of the
model. This reflects that the lower part of the dispersion is affected by the
long range physics. Finally, multiplicative logarithmic corrections are absent
in the scaling of the entanglement gap, in contrast with the higher-dimensional
case.

even- and odd-parity SC states, separated by a first order phase boundary at
$\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*}=4\,\textrm{T}$. Such parity switching is possible due to
a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites located in locally
non-centrosymmetric environments of the globally centrosymmetric lattice.
Existing reports suggest a possibility of the QDW transition line joining the
SC1-SC2 phase boundary at a multicritical point and propose an alternative
interpretation of the transition at $H^{*}$: It separates a mixed SC+QDW (SC1)
and a pure SC (SC2) states. Here, we present a detailed study of higher quality
single crystals of CeRh$_2$As$_2$, showing much sharper signatures of the phase
transitions at $T_{\textrm{c}}=0.31\,\textrm{K}$ and
$T_{\textrm{0}}=0.48\,\textrm{K}$. We refine the $T$-$H$ phase diagram of
CeRh$_2$As$_2$ and demonstrate that $T_{\textrm{0}}(H)$ and $T_{\textrm{c}}(H)$
lines meet at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H\approx6\,\textrm{T}$, well above $H^{*}$,
implying no influence of the QDW on the SC phase switching. We do not detect
the QDW transition within the SC2 state. A basic analysis with the
Ginzburg-Landau theory suggests that we have a weak competing interaction
between the two order parameters.

Multimodal characterization is commonly required for understanding materials.
User facilities possess the infrastructure to perform these measurements,
albeit in serial over days to months. In this paper, we describe a unified
multimodal measurement of a single sample library at distant instruments,
driven by a concert of distributed agents that use analysis from each modality
to inform the direction of the other in real time. Powered by the Bluesky
project at the National Synchrotron Light Source II, this experiment is a
world's first for beamline science, and provides a blueprint for future
approaches to multimodal and multifidelity experiments at user facilities.

Spontaneous electric polarization of solid ferroelectrics follows aligning
directions of crystallographic axes. Domains of differently oriented
polarization are separated by domain walls (DWs), which are predominantly flat
and run along directions dictated by the bulk translational order and the
sample surfaces. Here we explore DWs in a ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid
crystal, which is a fluid with polar long-range orientational order but no
crystallographic axes nor facets. We demonstrate that DWs in the absence of
bulk and surface aligning axes are shaped as conic sections. The conics bisect
the angle between two neighboring polarization fields to avoid electric
charges. The remarkable bisecting properties of conic sections, known for
millennia, play a central role as intrinsic features of liquid ferroelectrics.
The findings could be helpful in designing patterns of electric polarization
and space charge.

Computing correlation functions in strongly-interacting quantum systems is
one of the most important challenges of modern condensed matter theory, due to
their importance in the description of many physical observables.
Simultaneously, this challenge is one of the most difficult to address, due to
the inapplicability of traditional perturbative methods or the few-body
limitations of numerical approaches. For special cases, where the model is
integrable, methods based on the Bethe Ansatz have succeeded in computing the
spectrum and given us analytical expressions for the matrix elements of
physically important operators. However, leveraging these results to compute
correlation functions generally requires the numerical evaluation of summations
over eigenstates. To perform these summations efficiently, Hilbert space
exploration algorithms have been developed which has resulted most notably in
the ABACUS library. While this performs quite well for correlations on ground
states or low-entropy states, the case of high entropy states (most importantly
at finite temperatures or after a quantum quench) is more difficult, and leaves
room for improvement. In this work, we develop a new Hilbert space exploration
algorithm for the Lieb-Liniger model, specially tailored to optimize the
computational order on finite-entropy states for correlations of
density-related operators.

<h3>Easy-plane spin Hall oscillator</h3>

Spin Hall oscillators (SHOs) based on bilayers of a ferromagnet (FM) and a
non-magnetic heavy metal (HM) are electrically tunable nanoscale microwave
signal generators. Achieving high output power in SHOs requires driving
large-amplitude magnetization dynamics by a direct spin Hall current. The
maximum possible amplitude of such oscillations with the precession cone angle
nearing $90^\circ$ is predicted for FM layers with easy-plane magnetic
anisotropy and spin Hall current polarization perpendicular to the easy plane.
While many FMs exhibit natural easy-plane anisotropy in the FM film plane, the
spin Hall current in a HM|FM bilayer is polarized in this plane and thus cannot
drive large-amplitude magneto-dynamics. Here we present a new type of SHO
engineered to have the easy-plane anisotropy oriented normal to the film plane,
enabling large-amplitude easy-plane dynamics driven by spin Hall current. Our
experiments and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the desired
easy-plane anisotropy can be achieved by tuning the magnetic shape anisotropy
and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a nanowire SHO, leading to a
significant enhancement of the generated microwave power. The easy-plane SHO
experimentally demonstrated here is an ideal candidate for realization of a
spintronic spiking neuron. Our results provide a new approach to design of
high-power SHOs for wireless communications, neuromorphic computing, and
microwave assisted magnetic recording.

We investigate the electronic structure of highly conducting perovskite
SrMoO$_{3}$ using valence band photoemission spectroscopy and electronic
structure calculations. Large intensity corresponding to coherent feature close
to Fermi level is captured by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. An
additional satellite at $\sim$ 3 eV binding energy remains absent in DFT,
hybrid functional (DFT-hybrid) and dynamical mean field theory (DFT + DMFT)
calculations. Mo 4$d$ spectra obtained with different surface sensitive
photoemission spectroscopy suggest different surface and bulk electronic
structures. DFT + DMFT spectral function is in excellent agreement with the
coherent feature in the bulk Mo 4$d$ spectra, revealing moderate electron
correlation strength. A large plasmon satellite and signature of strong
electron correlation are observed in the surface spectra, while the bulk
spectra exhibits a $weak$ plasmon satellite.

<br>
In this paper, a magnon-bandgap controllable artificial domain wall waveguide
is proposed by means of micromagnetic simulation. By the investigation of the
propagation behavior and dispersion relationship of spin waves in artificial
domain wall waveguides, it is found that the nonreciprocal propagation of spin
waves in the artificial domain walls are mainly affected by the local effective
exchange field, and the magnon bandgap can be controlled by changing the
maximum value of the effective exchange field. In addition, it is observed that
the artificial domain wall waveguides are structurally more stable than the
natural domain wall waveguides under the same spin wave injection conditions,
and the magnon bandgap of the artificial domain wall waveguides can be adjusted
by its width and magnetic anisotropy parameters. The bandgap controllable
artificial domain wall scheme is beneficial to the miniaturization and
integration of magnon devices and can be applied to future magnonic technology
as a novel frequency filter.

<h3>Geometric Theory of Mechanical Screening in two-dimensional solids</h3>

Holes in mechanical metamaterials, quasi-localized plastic events in
amorphous solids, and bound dislocations in a hexatic matter are different
mechanisms of generic stress relaxation in solids. Regardless of the specific
mechanism, these and other local stress relaxation modes are quadrupolar in
nature, forming the foundation for stress screening in solids, similar to
polarization fields in electrostatic media. We propose a geometric theory for
stress screening in generalized solids based on this observation. The theory
includes a hierarchy of screening modes, each characterized by internal length
scales, and is partially analogous to theories of electrostatic screening such
as dielectrics and Debye-H{\"u}ckel theory. Additionally, our formalism
suggests that the hexatic phase, traditionally defined by structural
properties, can also be defined by mechanical properties and may exist in
amorphous materials.

Realistic microscale domains are an essential step towards making modern
multiscale simulations more applicable to computational materials engineering.
For this purpose, 3D computed tomography scans can be very expensive or
technically impossible for certain materials, whereas 2D information can be
easier obtained. Based on a single or three orthogonal 2D slices, the recently
proposed differentiable microstructure characterization and reconstruction
(DMCR) algorithm is able to reconstruct multiple plausible 3D realizations of
the microstructure based on statistical descriptors, i.e., without the need for
a training data set. Building upon DMCR, this work introduces a highly accurate
two-stage reconstruction algorithm that refines the DMCR results under
consideration of microstructure descriptors. Furthermore, the 2D-to-3D
reconstruction is validated using a real computed tomography (CT) scan of a
recently developed beta-Ti/TiFe alloy as well as anisotropic "bone-like"
spinodoid structures. After a detailed discussion of systematic errors in the
descriptor space, the reconstructed microstructures are compared to the
reference in terms of the numerically obtained effective elastic and plastic
properties. Together with the free accessibility of the presented algorithms in
MCRpy, the excellent results in this study motivate interdisciplinary
cooperation in applying numerical multiscale simulations for computational
materials engineering.

Research efforts on the low temperature magnetic order and electronic
properties of U$_3$O$_8$ have been inconclusive so far. Reinterpreting neutron
scattering results, we use group representation theory to show that the ground
state presents collinear out-of-plane magnetic moments, with antiferromagnetic
coupling both in-layer and between layers. Charge localization relieves the
initial geometric frustration, generating a slightly distorted honeycomb
sublattice with N\'eel order. We show, furthermore, that spin-orbit coupling
has a giant effect on the conduction band states and band gap value. Our
results allow a reinterpretation of recent optical absorption measurements.

Graphene is an ideal platform to study the coherence of quantum interference
pathways by tuning doping or laser excitation energy. The latter produces a
Raman excitation profile that provides direct insight into the lifetimes of
intermediate electronic excitations and, therefore, on quantum interference,
which has so far remained elusive. Here, we control the Raman scattering
pathways by tuning the laser excitation energy in graphene doped up to 1.05eV,
above what achievable with electrostatic doping. The Raman excitation profile
of the G mode indicates its position and full width at half maximum are
linearly dependent on doping. Doping-enhanced electron-electron interactions
dominate the lifetime of Raman scattering pathways, and reduce Raman
interference. This paves the way for engineering quantum pathways in doped
graphene, nanotubes and topological insulators.

We study the effects of noise cross-correlations on the steady states of
driven, nonequilibrium systems, which are described by two stochastically
driven dynamical variables, in one dimension. We use a well-known
stochastically driven coupled model with two dynamical variables, where one of
the variables is autonomous being independent of the other, whereas the second
one depends explicitly on the former. Introducing cross-correlations of the two
noises in the two dynamical equations, we show that depending upon the details
of the nonlinear coupling between the dynamical fields, such cross-correlations
can induce instabilities in the models, that are otherwise stable in the
absence of any cross-correlations. We argue that this is reminiscent of the
roughening transition found in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions
greater than two. Phenomenological implications of our results are discussed.

<br>
Motivated by the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) in solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK)
model and ubiquitous quantum oscillation phenomena observed in strongly
correlated electron systems, we have studied the quantum oscillation in HK
model in terms of a combination of analytic and numerical calculation. The
analytic results indicate the existence of quantum oscillation in NFL state and
its properties can be described by Lifshitz-Kosevich-like formula. Although
numerical simulation from exact diagonolization exhibits certain oscillation
behavior, it is hard to extract its oscillation period and amplitude.
Therefore, more work (particularly the large-scale numerical simulation) on
this interesting issue is highly desirable and we expect the current study on
HK model will be helpful to understand generic quantum oscillation in
correlated electron materials.

In this paper we present Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) Fortran 90/95
versions of previously published numerical programs for solving the dipolar
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation including the contact interaction in one, two
and three spatial dimensions. The atoms are considered to be polarized along
the z axis and we consider different cases, e.g., stationary and non-stationary
solutions of the GP equation for a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in
one dimension (along x and z axes), two dimensions (in x-y and x-z planes), and
three dimensions. The algorithm used is the split-step semi-implicit
Crank-Nicolson scheme for imaginary- and real-time propagation to obtain
stationary states and BEC dynamics, respectively, as in the previous version
[R. Kishor Kumar et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 195, 117 (2015)]. These OpenMP
versions have significantly reduced execution time in multicore processors.

<h3>Universality in nonlinear passage through the miscible-immiscible phase  transition in two component Bose-Einstein condensates</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this study, we investigate the formation of domain defects and the
universal critical real-time dynamics in a two-component Bose-Einstein
condensate with nonlinear quenching across the miscible-immiscible phase
transition. By analyzing the Bogoliubov excitations, we obtain the power-law
relations among the defect density, the phase transition delay and the quench
time near the phase transition. Moreover, by simulating the real-time dynamics
across the miscible-immiscible phase transition, we clearly show the formation
of domain defects and the delay of the phase transition. Furthermore, we find
that the domain defects are suppressed by large nonlinear coefficients and long
quench times. To accurately characterize the domain defects, we quantify the
defect excitations using the correlation length and the domain number. In
addition, by combining the power-law relations between the phase transition
delay and the quench time, we extract the critical exponents for different
nonlinear coefficients. Our study not only confirms that the critical exponents
do not sensitively depend on the nonlinear quenches but also provides a dynamic
path toward the suppression of nonadiabatic excitation.

<h3>Effect of polydispersity in concentrated magnetorheological fluids</h3>

Magnetorheological fluids (MRF) are smart materials of increasing interest
due to their great versatility in mechanical and mechatronic systems. As main
rheological features, MRFs must present low viscosity in the absence of a
magnetic field (0.1 - 1.0 Pa.s) and high yield stress (50 - 100 kPa) when
magnetized, in order to optimize the magnetorheological effect. Such
properties, in turn, are directly influenced by the composition, volume
fraction, size, and size distribution (polydispersity) of the particles, the
latter being an important piece in the improvement of these main properties. In
this context, the present work aims to analyze, through experiments and
simulations, the influence of polydispersity on the maximum packing fraction,
on the yield stress under field (on-state), and on the plastic viscosity in the
absence of field (off-state) of concentrated MRF (phi = 48.5 vol.%). Three
blends of carbonyl iron powder in polyalphaolefin oil were prepared. These
blends have the same mode, but different polydispersity indexes, ranging from
0.46 to 1.44. Separate simulations show that the random close packing fraction
increases from about 68% to 80% as the polydispersity index increases over this
range. The on-state yield stress, in turn, is raised from 30 +/- 0.5 kPa to 42
+/- 2 kPa (B ~ 0.57 T) and the off-state plastic viscosity, is reduced from 4.8
Pa.s to 0.5 Pa.s. Widening the size distributions, as is well known in the
literature, increases packing efficiency and reduces the viscosity of
concentrated dispersions, but beyond that, it proved to be a viable way to
increase the magnetorheological effect of concentrated MRF. The Brouwers model,
which considers the void fraction in suspensions of particles with lognormal
distribution, was proposed as a possible hypothesis to explain the increase in
yield stress under magnetic field.

Zero-point quantum fluctuations of a N\'eel order can produce effective
interactions between quasi-orphan spins weakly coupled to the lattice. On the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}-$distorted triangular lattice, this phenomenon leads to
a correlated partially disordered phase. In this article, we use matrix product
state methods to study a similar model: the $S=1/2$ stuffed square lattice.
Tunning the exchange amplitudes we go from a square lattice plus orphan central
spins at $J'/J =0$, to the union jack lattice at $J'/J=1$, and a square lattice
including all spins at $J/J'=0$. We calculate the complete antiferromagnetic
phase diagram, dominated by ferrimagnetic and N\'eel orders, and compare with
existing results. Most importantly, we find a partially disordered phase in the
weakly frustrated regime. In this phase, the N\'eel order from the square
lattice is unaffected, while the central spins form a collective state with
exponentially decaying double striped correlations. We also study the role of
quantum fluctuations by introducing an ordering staggered magnetic field on the
square sublattice, and find that the central spins order ferromagnetically when
fluctuations from the N\'eel order are suppressed.

Local deformation of atomically thin van der Waals materials provides a
powerful approach to create site-controlled chip-compatible single-photon
emitters (SPEs). However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the formation
of such strain-induced SPEs are still not fully clear, which hinders further
efforts in their deterministic integration with nanophotonic structures for
developing practical on-chip sources of quantum light. Here we investigate SPEs
with single-photon purity up to 98% created in monolayer WSe$_2$ via
nanoindentation. Using photoluminescence imaging in combination with atomic
force microscopy, we locate single-photon emitting sites on a deep
sub-wavelength spatial scale and reconstruct the details of the surrounding
local strain potential. The obtained results suggest that the origin of the
observed single-photon emission is likely related to strain-induced spectral
shift of dark excitonic states and their hybridization with localized states of
individual defects.

<h3>Study on the composition optimization method for improving the fluidity  of cast Ti$_2$AlNb alloy and its mechanism</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper, the effects of Al, Nb main elements, Fe, Mo, W, Co, B, Si and
their contents on the fluidity of Ti-22Al-25Nb alloy were investigated. The
composition that was beneficial to improve the fluidity was screened through
the thermodynamic software calculating thermophysical parameters affecting the
fluidity of Ti$_2$AlNb alloy, the numerical simulation test of its fluidity and
the verification test of the fluidity of optimized alloys. Finally, the
improvement mechanism of the alloy fluidity was discussed. Results showed that
the appropriate reduction of Nb element was better than Al element for the
improvement of fluidity. The addition of trace Fe, B and Si elements were
beneficial to the improvement of fluidity, the improvement effect of B element
was best, while the addition of trace Mo, W, Co were not conducive to the
improvement of fluidity. The cessation mechanism of Ti$_2$AlNb alloy is the
cessation mechanism of the alloy with a wide crystallization temperature range.
The composition which was most beneficial to improve the fluidity was
Ti-22Al-24Nb-0.1B. The main reasons for the improvement of the fluidity had two
sides: on the one hand, the reduction of 1at% Nb and the addition of 0.1at% B
not only increased the superheat and crystallization latent heat of the alloy,
but also reduced the melt viscosity and thermal conductivity, thus improving
the fluidity. On the other hand, the TiB phase refined the grains, the fine
grains prevented the dendrite from growing into developed dendrite networks,
inhibited the adverse effect of the increase in the width of the solidification
zone on the fluidity, reduced the flow resistance of the molten metal, and
further improved the fluidity of the alloy.

The mutual coupling of spin and lattice degrees of freedom is ubiquitous in
magnetic materials and potentially creates exotic magnetic states in response
to the external magnetic field. Here, we investigate phase transitions of a
geometrically frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet LiGaCr$_{4}$O$_{8}$,
comprised of a breathing pyrochlore network of spin-3/2 Cr$^{3+}$ ions, up to
600 T by means of magnetization and magnetostriction measurements. We observe a
two-step magnetostructural transition between 150 T and 200 T prior to a
half-magnetization plateau. Considering a microscopic magnetoelastic theory,
the intermediate-field phase can be assigned to a magnetic superstructure with
a three-dimensional periodic array of 3-up-1-down spin molecules and canted
2-up-2-down ones. We attribute the emergence of the magnetic superstructure to
a unique combination of the strong spin-lattice coupling and large breathing
anisotropy.

<h3>Does quantized charge transport in disordered Floquet topological  insulators require Anderson localization?</h3>

<i>Lennard Berg, Andreas Alvermann, Holger Fehske</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform a numerical study of Floquet topological insulators with temporal
disorder to investigate the existence of quantized charge transport without
Anderson localization. We first argue that in setups with temporal
imperfections Anderson localization can not be expected but bulk transport is
diffusive in the long-time limit. In a second step we compute the corrections
to the cumulative averaged pumped charge due to the temporal disorder and show
that transport is characterized by two regimes: the transient regime,
represented by a plateau for uncorrelated disorder, and the long-time behavior
with a common scaling law for both uncorrelated and correlated disorder. Most
notably, our numerical results indicate that the dynamic corrections vanish in
the long-time limit such that quantized charge transport and diffusive bulk
motion can coexist in temporally disordered Floquet topological insulators.

Self-assembly of chiral particles with an L-shape is explored by Monte-Carlo
computer simulations in two spatial dimensions. For sufficiently high packing
densities in confinement, a carpet-like texture emerges due to the interlocking
of L-shaped particles, resembling a distorted smectic liquid crystalline layer
pattern. From the positions of either of the two axes of the particles, two
different types of layers can be extracted, which form distinct but
complementary entangled networks. These coarse-grained network structures are
then analyzed from a topological point of view. We propose a global charge
conservation law by using an analogy to uniaxial smectics and show that the
individual network topology can be steered by both confinement and particle
geometry. Our topological analysis provides a general classification framework
for applications to other intertwined dual networks.

{\mu}-Co7Nb6 phase deform plastically by basal slip at either room temperature
or 600 oC. At room temperature, the Co-49Nb and Co-52Nb micropillars show high
yield stresses and an abrupt large strain burst at the onset of yielding
regardless of orientation, whereas the Co-54Nb micropillars oriented for basal
slip yield at much lower stresses and show intermittent small strain bursts
during plastic deformation. While the Co-49Nb micropillars deform by full
dislocation slip on the basal plane at room temperature, the Co-54Nb
micropillars deform by partial dislocation slip on the basal plane. At 600 oC,
the Co-49Nb micropillars oriented for basal slip show stable and continuous
plasticity and their critical resolved shear stress decreases dramatically. The
plastic deformation of the Co-49Nb micropillars occurs via partial dislocation
slip on the basal plane at 600 oC. Based on the geometric {\gamma}-surfaces for
all potential basal slip planes, we explore where and why the glide of full and
partial dislocations on the basal plane occurs in the {\mu}-Co7Nb6 phase.

We revisit the Partisan Voter Model (PVM) reporting analytical results for
the quasi-stationary distribution, exit probabilities and fixation times.
Similarly to the Noisy Voter Model (NVM) we introduce a Noisy version of the
PVM (NPVM). We find that the finite size noise induced transition of the NVM is
modified in the NPVM so that there exists a new intermediate phase.

Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are promising materials for
classical and quantum lightemission applications. To gain a better
understanding of their outstanding properties, a thorough understanding of the
band-edge exciton emission is needed which is not reachable in ensemble and
room temperature studies because of broadening effects. Here, we report on a
study of the photoluminescence (PL) of single CsPbBr$_3$ NCs in the
intermediate quantum confinement regime at cryogenic temperature. We reveal the
size-dependence of the spectral features observed in single NCs PL: the
bright-triplet exciton energy splittings, the trion and biexciton binding
energies as well as the optical phonon replica spectrum. In addition, we show
that the bright triplet energy splittings are consistent with a pure exchange
model and that the variety of polarisation properties and PL spectra of single
CsPbBr$_3$ NCs can be simply rationalised by considering the orientation of the
emitting dipoles and the thermal populations of the emitting states.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials for
applications in nanoelectronics and correlated fields, where their metallic
edge states play a fundamental role in the electronic transport. In this work,
we investigate the transport properties of MoS$_2$ zigzag nanoribbons under a
butadiene (C$_4$H$_6$) atmosphere, as this compound has been used to obtain
MoS$_2$ flakes by exfoliation. We use density functional theory combined with
non-equilibrium Green's function techniques, in a methodology contemplating
disorder and different coverages. Our results indicate a strong modulation of
the TMDC electronic transport properties driven by butadiene molecules anchored
at their edges, producing the suppression of currents due to a backscattering
process. Our results indicate a high sensitivity of the TMDC edge states. Thus,
the mechanisms used to reduce the dimensionality of MoS$_2$ considerably modify
its transport properties.

<h3>Hard-needle elastomer in one spatial dimension</h3>

We perform exact Statistical Mechanics calculations for a system of elongated
objects (hard needles) that are restricted to translate along a line and rotate
within a plane, and that interact via both excluded-volume steric repulsion and
harmonic elastic forces between neighbors. This system represents a
one-dimensional model of a liquid crystal elastomer, and has a zero-tension
critical point that we describe using the transfer-matrix method. In the
absence of elastic interactions, we build on previous results by Kantor and
Kardar, and find that the nematic order parameter $Q$ decays linearly with
tension $\sigma$. In the presence of elastic interactions, the system exhibits
a standard universal scaling form, with $Q / |\sigma|$ being a function of the
rescaled elastic energy constant $k / |\sigma|^\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is a
critical exponent equal to $2$ for this model. At zero tension, simple scaling
arguments lead to the asymptotic behavior $Q \sim k^{1/\Delta}$, which does not
depend on the equilibrium distance of the springs in this model.

<h3>Estimating random close packing in polydisperse and bidisperse hard  spheres via an equilibrium model of crowding</h3>

We show that an analogy between crowding in fluid and jammed phases of hard
spheres captures the density dependence of the kissing number for a family of
numerically generated jammed states. We extend this analogy to jams of mixtures
of hard spheres in $d=3$ dimensions, and thus obtain an estimate of the random
close packing (RCP) volume fraction, $\phi_{\textrm{RCP}}$, as a function of
size polydispersity. We first consider mixtures of particle sizes with discrete
distributions. For binary systems, we show agreement between our predictions
and simulations, using both our own and results reported in previous works, as
well as agreement with recent experiments from the literature. We then apply
our approach to systems with continuous polydispersity, using three different
particle size distributions, namely the log-normal, Gamma, and truncated
power-law distributions. In all cases, we observe agreement between our
theoretical findings and numerical results up to rather large polydispersities
for all particle size distributions, when using as reference our own
simulations and results from the literature. In particular, we find
$\phi_{\textrm{RCP}}$ to increase monotonically with the relative standard
deviation, $s_{\sigma}$, of the distribution, and to saturate at a value that
always remains below 1. A perturbative expansion yields a closed-form
expression for $\phi_{\textrm{RCP}}$ that quantitatively captures a
distribution-independent regime for $s_{\sigma} < 0.5$. Beyond that regime, we
show that the gradual loss in agreement is tied to the growth of the skewness
of size distributions.

<h3>The $(2 + δ)$-dimensional theory of the electromechanics of lipid  membranes: I. Electrostatics</h3>

The coupling of electric fields to the mechanics of lipid membranes gives
rise to intriguing electromechanical behavior, as, for example, evidenced by
the deformation of lipid vesicles in external electric fields.
Electromechanical effects are relevant for many biological processes, such as
the propagation of action potentials in axons and the activation of
mechanically-gated ion channels. Currently, a theoretical framework describing
the electromechanical behavior of arbitrarily curved and deforming lipid
membranes does not exist. Purely mechanical models commonly treat lipid
membranes as two-dimensional surfaces, ignoring their finite thickness. While
holding analytical and numerical merit, this approach cannot describe the
coupling of lipid membranes to electric fields and is thus unsuitable for
electromechanical models. In a sequence of articles, we derive an
\textit{effective} surface theory of the electromechanics of lipid membranes,
named a $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory, which has the advantages of surface
descriptions while accounting for finite thickness effects. The present article
proposes a new, generic dimension-reduction procedure relying on low-order
spectral expansions. This procedure is applied to the electrostatics of lipid
membranes to obtain a $(2+\delta)$-dimensional theory that captures potential
differences across and electric fields within lipid membranes. This new model
is tested on different geometries relevant for lipid membranes, showing good
agreement with the corresponding three-dimensional electrostatics theory.

<h3>Anisotropic magnetism and electronic structure of trigonal  EuAl$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystals</h3>

The magnetic and electronic properties of the layered Zintl-phase compound
EuAl$_2$Ge$_2$ crystallizing in the trigonal CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type structure are
reported. Our neutron-diffraction measurements show that EuAl$_2$Ge$_2$
undergoes A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below $T_{\rm N} =
27.5(5)$~K, with the Eu moments (Eu$^{2+}$, $S = 7/2$) aligned
ferromagnetically in the $ab$ plane. The $H = 0$ magnetic structure consists of
trigonal AFM domains associated with $ab$-plane magnetic anisotropy and a
field-induced reorientation of the Eu spins in the domains is evident at $T =
2$~K below the critical field $H_{c1} = 2.5(1)$ kOe. Electrical resistivity and
ARPES measurements show that EuAl$_2$Ge$_2$ is metallic both above and below
$T_{\rm N}$. In the AFM phase, we directly observe folded bands in ARPES due to
the doubling of the magnetic unit cell along the $c$ axis with an enhancement
of quasiparticle weight due to the complex change in the coupling between the
magnetic moments and itinerant electrons on cooling below $T_{\rm N}$. The
observed electronic structure is well reproduced by first-principle
calculations, which also predict the presence of nontrivial electronic states
near the Fermi level in the AFM phase with $Z_2$ topological numbers 1;(000).
