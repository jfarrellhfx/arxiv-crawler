<h3>Dynamic flexoelectric instabilities in nematic liquid crystals</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08325</a>
<br>
</p><i>E.S. Pikina, A.R. Muratov, E.I. Kats, V.V. Lebedev</i>
<p>Electro-hydrodynamic phenomena in liquid crystals constitute an old but still
very active research area. The reason is that these phenomena play the key role
in various applications of liquid crystals and due to the general interest of
physical community to out-of-equilibrium systems. Nematic liquid crystals
(NLCs) are ideally representative for such investigations. Our article aims to
study theoretically the linear NLCs dynamics. We include into consideration
orientation elastic energy, hydrodynamic motion, external alternating electric
field, electric conductivity and flexoelectric polarization. We analyze the
linear stability of the NLC film, determining dynamics of perturbations with
respect to the homogeneous initial state of the NLC. For the purpose we compute
eigen-values of the evolution matrix for a period of the external alternating
electric field. These eigen-values determine the amplification factors for the
modes during the period. The instability occurs when the principal eigen-value
of the evolution matrix becomes unity by its absolute value. The condition
determines the threshold (critical field) for the instability of the uniform
state. It turns out that one might expect various types of the instability,
only partially known and investigated in the literature. Particularly, we find
that the flexoelectric instability may lead to two-dimensionally space
modulated patterns exhibiting time oscillations. This type of the structures
was somehow overlooked in the previous works.

<h3>Dissipative frequency converter: from Lindblad dynamics to non-Hermitian  topology</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07991" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07991</a>
<br>
</p><i>Florian Koch, Jan Carl Budich</i>
<p>A topological frequency converter represents a dynamical counterpart of the
integer quantum Hall effect, where a two-level system enacts a quantized
time-averaged power transfer between two driving modes of incommensurate
frequency. Here, we investigate as to what extent temporal coherence in the
quantum dynamics of the two-level system is important for the topological
quantization of the converter. To this end, we consider dissipative channels
corresponding to spontaneous decay and dephasing in the instantaneous
eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian as well as spontaneous decay in a fixed basis.
The dissipation is modelled using both a full Lindblad and an effective
non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian description. For all three dissipation channels
we find a transition from the unperturbed dynamics to a quantum watchdog
effect, which destroys any power transfer in the strong coupling limit. This is
striking because the watchdog effect leads to perfectly adiabatic dynamics in
the instantaneous eigenbasis, at first glance similar to the unperturbed case.
Furthermore, it is found that dephasing immediately leads to an exponential
decay of the power transfer in time due to loss of polarisation in the mixed
quantum state. Finally, we discuss the appearance in the effective NH
trajectory description of non-adiabatic processes, which are suppressed in the
full Lindblad dynamics.

<h3>Nodal d-wave pairing from spin fluctuations in a thermally disordered  anti-ferromagnet</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07999" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07999</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nick Bultinck</i>
<p>We consider electron pairing in a two-dimensional thermally disordered
itinerant anti-ferromagnet. It is shown that transverse spin fluctuations in
such a state can give rise to superconductivity with a sizeable critical
temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ there is quasi-long-range spin-singlet and
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ superconducting order, together with fluctuating triplet order at
momentum $(\pi,\pi)$. The singlet pairs we find are tightly bound together, and
the pair wavefunction has a purely inter-sublattice structure due to the U(1)
spin rotation symmetry of the anti-ferromagnet.

<h3>doped: Python toolkit for robust and repeatable charged defect supercell  calculations</h3>

<p>Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key
properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial
importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational
methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict
defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic
properties. Here we report `doped`, a Python package for the generation,
pre-/post-processing and analysis of defect supercell calculations. `doped` has
been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient,
user-friendly yet powerful and fully-flexible manner, with the goal of
providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible
calculations of solid-state defect properties.

<h3>Bending Mechanics of Biomimetic Scale Plates</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08026" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08026</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pranta Rahman Sarkar, Hossein Ebrahimi, Md Shahjahan Hossain, Ranajay Ghosh</i>
<p>We develop the fundamentals of nonlinear and anisotropic bending behavior of
biomimetic scale plates using a combination of analytical modeling, finite
element (FE) computations, and motivational experiments. The analytical
architecture-property relationships are derived for both synclastic and
anticlastic curvatures. The results show that, as the scales engage, both
synclastic and anticlastic deformations show non-linear scale contact
kinematics and cross-curvature sensitivity of moments resulting in strong
curvature-dependent elastic nonlinearity and emergent anisotropy. The
anisotropy of bending rigidities and their evolution with curvature are
affected by both the direction and magnitude of bending as well as scale
geometry parameters, and their distribution on the substrate. Like earlier
beam-like substrates, kinematic locked states were found to occur; however,
their existence and evolution are also strongly determined by scale geometry
and imposed cross-curvatures. This validated model helps us to quantify bending
response, locking behavior, and their geometric dependence, paving the way for
a deeper understanding of the nature of nonlinearity and anisotropy of these
systems.

<h3>Anomalous Shiba spectrum and superconductivity induced magnetic  interactions in materials with topological band inversion</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08028" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08028</a>
<br>
</p><i>Didier Ndengeyintwali, Shiva Heidari, Cody Youmans, Pavan Hosur, Pouyan Ghaemi</i>
<p>We study the Shiba states in materials with bulk band inversion such as
iron-based topological superconductors or doped topological insulators. We show
that the structure of the Shiba state spectrum depends on the doping level
relative to the chemical potential at which the band-inversion occurs.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the transition from ferro-magnetic to
antiferromagnetic coupling and vice versa, which is caused by the coupling of
magnetic impurities through the overlap of Shiba states, is highly dependent on
the doping level. Additionally, topological edge states may have a substantial
impact on the Shiba states, leading to a decrease in Shiba state energies and
the creation of new states when the magnetic impurity approaches the boundary.

<h3>Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnet CaMnTeO6: Strong Quantum  Fluctuations and Role of s0 vs. s2 Electronic States in Competing Exchange  Interactions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08069" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08069</a>

<p>Noncentrosymmetric triangular magnets offer a unique platform for realizing
strong quantum fluctuations. However, designing these quantum materials remains
an open challenge attributable to a knowledge gap in the tunability of
competing exchange interactions at the atomic level. Here, we create a new
noncentrosymmetric triangular S = 3/2 magnet CaMnTeO6 based on careful chemical
and physical considerations. The model material displays competing magnetic
interactions and features nonlinear optical responses with the capability of
generating coherent photons. The incommensurate magnetic ground state of
CaMnTeO6 with an unusually large spin rotation angle of 127 deg.(1) indicates
that the anisotropic interlayer exchange is strong and competing with the
isotropic interlayer Heisenberg interaction. The moment of 1.39(1) {\mu}B,
extracted from low-temperature heat capacity and neutron diffraction
measurements, is only 46% of the expected value of the static moment 3 {\mu}B.
This reduction indicates the presence of strong quantum fluctuations in the
half-integer spin S = 3/2 CaMnTeO6 magnet, which is rare. By comparing the
spin-polarized band structure, chemical bonding, and physical properties of
AMnTeO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Pb), we demonstrate how quantum-chemical interpretation
can illuminate insights into the fundamentals of magnetic exchange
interactions, providing a powerful tool for modulating spin dynamics with
atomically precise control.

<p>Grain rotation in crystals often results in coarsening or refinement of the
grains that modify the mechanical and thermal properties of materials. While
many studies have explored how externally applied stress and temperature drive
grain structure dynamics in nano-polycrystalline materials, the analogous
studies on colossal grains have been limited, especially in the absence of
external force. In this work, we used X-ray free electron laser pulses to
irradiate single-crystalline bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) and observed grain
boundary formation and subsequent grain rotation in response to the X-ray
radiation. Our observations with simultaneous X-ray diffraction and
transmission X-ray microscopy demonstrate how intense X-ray radiation can
rapidly change grain morphologies of initially single-crystalline material.

<h3>EXCOGITO, an extensible coarse-graining toolbox for the investigation of  biomolecules by means of low-resolution representation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08097</a>
<br>
</p><i>Marco Giulini, Raffaele Fiorentini, Luca Tubiana, Raffaello Potestio, Roberto Menichetti</i>
<p>Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) models proved to be essential to complement and
sometimes even replace all-atom representations of soft matter systems and
biological macromolecules. The development of low-resolution models takes the
moves from the reduction of the degrees of freedom employed, that is, the
definition of a mapping between a system's high-resolution description and its
simplified counterpart. Even in absence of an explicit parametrisation and
simulation of a CG model, the observation of the atomistic system in simpler
terms can be informative: this idea is leveraged by the mapping entropy, a
measure of the information loss inherent to the process of coarsening. Mapping
entropy lies at the heart of the extensible coarse-graining toolbox, or
EXCOGITO, developed to perform a number of operations and analyses on molecular
systems pivoting around the properties of mappings. EXCOGITO can process an
all-atom trajectory to compute the mapping entropy, identify the mapping that
minimizes it, and establish quantitative relations between a low-resolution
representation and geometrical, structural, and energetic features of the
system. Here, the software, which is available free of charge under an open
source licence, is presented and showcased to introduce potential users to its
capabilities and usage.

<p>Magnetic random access memory that uses magnetic tunnel junction memory cells
is a high performance, non-volatile memory technology that goes beyond
traditional charge-based memories. Today its speed is limited by the high
magnetization of the memory storage layer. Here we show that fast and highly
reliable switching is possible using a very low magnetization ferrimagnetic
Heusler alloy, Mn3Ge. Moreover, the tunneling magnetoresistance is the highest
yet achieved for a ferrimagnetic material at ambient temperature. Furthermore,
the devices were prepared on technologically relevant amorphous substrates
using a novel combination of a nitride seed layer and a chemical templating
layer. These results show a clear path to the lowering of switching currents
using ferrimagnetic Heusler materials and, therefore, to the scaling of high
performance magnetic random access memories beyond those nodes possible with
ferromagnetic devices.

<h3>Evaluation of the AMOEBA force field for simulating metal halide  perovskites in the solid state and in solution</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08134" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08134</a>
<br>
</p><i>P.V.G.M. Rathnayake, Stefano Bernardi, Asaph Widmer-Cooper</i>
<p>In this work, we compare existing non-polarizable force fields developed to
study the solid or solution phases of hybrid organic-inorganic halide
perovskites with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The aim is to test whether
more computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer
better transferability between solution and solid phases, with the ultimate
goal being the study of crystal nucleation, growth and other interfacial
phenomena involving these ionic compounds. In the context of hybrid
perovskites, AMOEBA force field parameters already exist for several elements
in solution and we decided to leave them unchanged and to only parameterize the
missing ones (Pb\textsuperscript{2+} and
CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{+} ions) in order to
maximise transferability and avoid over-fitting to the specific examples
studied here. Overall, we find that AMOEBA yields accurate hydration free
energies (within 5\%) for typical ionic species while showing the correct
ordering of stability for the different crystal polymorphs of
CsPbI\textsubscript{3} and
CH\textsubscript{3}NH\textsubscript{3}PbI\textsubscript{3}. While the existing
parameters do not accurately reproduce all transition temperatures and lattice
parameters, AMOEBA offers better transferability between solution and solid
states than existing non-polarizable force fields.

<h3>Ultra-long relaxation of a Kramers qubit formed in a bilayer graphene  quantum dot</h3>

<p>The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene a unique
platform for emerging types of semiconducting qubits. The single-carrier
quantum dot ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy where the two states
have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. By breaking the time-reversal
symmetry of this ground state with an out-of-plane magnetic field, a novel type
of qubit (Kramers qubit), encoded in the two-dimensional spin-valley subspace,
becomes accessible. The Kramers qubit is robust against known spin- and
valley-mixing mechanisms, as it requires a simultaneous change of both quantum
numbers, potentially resulting in long relaxation and coherence times. We
measure the relaxation time of a single carrier in the excited states of a
bilayer graphene quantum dot at small ($\sim \mathrm{mT}$) and zero magnetic
fields. We demonstrate ultra-long spin-valley relaxation times of the Kramers
qubit exceeding $30~\mathrm{s}$, which is about two orders of magnitude longer
than the spin relaxation time of $400~\mathrm{ms}$. The demonstrated
high-fidelity single-shot readout and long relaxation times are the foundation
for novel, long-lived semiconductor qubits.

<h3>Dipolar BF theory and dipolar braiding statistics</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08158</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jung Hoon Han</i>
<p>We analyze the recently proposed dipolar BF theory with couplings to charge
and dipole currents. The quasiparticles of the theory are either charge-like or
dipole-like, and the mutual braiding statistics between charge-like and
dipole-like quasiparticles are dipolar, meaning that it depends on the position
of the quasiparticle being encircled. The braiding statistics between two
dipole-like quasiparticles is that of ordinary anyons. We further prove that
the dipolar BF theory is equivalent to the rank-2 tensor BF theory developed
earlier as an effective theory for the rank-2 toric code. Although the two
theories are equivalent, the dipolar BF formulation embodies the dipole
symmetry explicitly and gives a clean insight into the way the dipole symmetry
manifests itself in various conservation laws and the dipolar braiding
statistics.

<p>We calculate the RKKY interactions derived from ab initio calculations for
the intermetallic compound CeCoSi exhibiting the hidden nonmagnetic order at
$T_0$ and examine the instability towards possible multipole orders within the
random phase approximation. All 36 multipole interactions up to rank 5 are
investigated, and the maximum susceptibility exhibits an antiferro order with
$\boldsymbol{q}=\boldsymbol{0}$ for nonmagnetic multipoles of monopole $I$ and
hexadecapole $H_{0}$, yielding a charge imbalance of $f$ electrons at two Ce
atoms in the unit cell, which is consistent with some experiments.

<h3>Thermal Hall effect in a van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Chunqiang Xu, Heda Zhang, Caitlin Carnahan, Pengpeng Zhang, Di Xiao, Xianglin Ke</i>
<p>CrI3 is a prototypical van der Waals ferromagnet with a magnetic honeycomb
lattice. Previous inelastic neutron scattering studies have suggested
topological nature of its magnetic excitations with a magnon gap at the Dirac
points, which are anticipated to give rise to magnon thermal Hall effect. Here
we report thermal transport properties of CrI3 and show that the long-sought
thermal Hall signal anticipated for topological magnons is fairly small. In
contrast, we find that CrI3 exhibits an appreciable anomalous thermal Hall
signal at lower temperature which may arise from magnon-phonon hybridization or
magnon-phonon scattering. These findings are anticipated to stimulate further
neutron scattering studies on CrI3 single crystal, which can shed light not
only on the intrinsic nature of magnetic excitations but also on the
magnon-phonon interaction.

<br>
</p><i>Ashish Joshi, Robert Peters, Thore Posske</i>
<p>We study the dynamics of quantum skyrmions under a magnetic field gradient
using neural network quantum states. First, we obtain a quantum skyrmion
lattice ground state using variational Monte Carlo with a restricted Boltzmann
machine as the variational ansatz for a quantum Heisenberg model with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Then, using the time-dependent variational
principle, we study the real-time evolution of quantum skyrmions after a
Hamiltonian quench with an inhomogeneous external magnetic field. We show that
field gradients are an effective way of manipulating and moving quantum
skyrmions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that quantum skyrmions can decay when
interacting with each other. This work shows that neural network quantum states
offer a promising way of studying the real-time evolution of quantum magnetic
systems that are outside the realm of exact diagonalization.

<h3>Hybrid magnon-phonon cavity for large-amplitude terahertz spin-wave  excitation</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shihao Zhuang, Xufeng Zhang, Yujie Zhu, Nian X. Sun, Chang-Beom Eom, Paul G. Evans, Jia-Mian Hu</i>
<p>Terahertz (THz) spin waves or their quanta, magnons, can be efficiently
excited by acoustic phonons because these excitations have similar wavevectors
in the THz regime. THz acoustic phonons can be produced using photoacoustic
phenomena but typically have a low population and thus a relatively low
displacement amplitude. The magnetization amplitude and population of the
acoustically excited THz magnons are thus usually small. Using analytical
calculations and dynamical phase-field simulations, we show that a freestanding
metal/magnetic-insulator (MI)/dielectric multilayer can be designed to produce
large-amplitude THz spin wave via cavity-enhanced magnon-phonon interaction.
The amplitude of the acoustically excited THz spin wave in the freestanding
multilayer is predicted to be more than ten times larger than in a
substrate-supported multilayer. Acoustically excited nonlinear magnon-magnon
interaction is demonstrated in the freestanding multilayer. The simulations
also indicate that the magnon modes can be detected by probing the charge
current in the metal layer generated via spin-charge conversion across the
MI/metal interface and the resulting THz radiation. Applications of the
freestanding multilayer in THz optoelectronic transduction are computationally
demonstrated.

<h3>Gauge invariant quantization for circuits including Josephson junctions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08188" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08188</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hiroyasu Koizumi</i>
<p>Recently, a new theory of superconductivity has been put forward that
attributes the origin of superconductivity to the appearance of a non-trivial
Berry connection from many-electron wave functions.
This theory reproduces the major results of the BCS theory with conserving
the particle number, and predicts the single-electron supercurrent tunneling
across the Josephson junction with keeping the correct Josephson relation. We
re-examine the quantization of superconducting qubit circuits by taking into
account the above development, and show that the dynamical variables used in
the standard theory, the flux nodes relating to the voltage, should be replaced
by those relating to the electromagnetic vector potential. The fact that the
Josephson junction tunneling allows the single-electron supercurrent tunneling
is the reason for the existence of excited single electrons in superconducting
qubits with Josephson junctions. We predict that it will be avoided by
weakening the coupling between two superconductors in the Josephson junction.

<h3>Phase transitions in typical $Pca2_1$ ferroelectrics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Heng Yu, Kan-Hao Xue, Nan Feng, Yunzhe Zheng, Yan Cheng, Ben Xu, Xiangshui Miao</i>
<p>While ferroelectric hafnia ($\mathrm{HfO_2}$) has become a technically
important material for microelectronics, the physical origin of its
ferroelectricity remains poorly understood. The tetragonal $P4_2/nmc$ phase is
commonly assigned as its paraelectric mother phase, but it has no soft mode at
the Brillouin zone center. In this work, we propose that the
paraelectric-ferroelectric transition in hafnia-like $Pca2_1$ ferroelectric
family can be described by a $Pcca$-$Pca2_1$ transition, where the $Pcca$
mother phase will evolve into either the $Pca2_1$ ferroelectric phase or the
centrosymmetric $P2_1/c$ monoclinic phase, depending on the strain conditions.
The $Pcca$ phase is directly linked to both phases in the context of continuous
phase transition. Hafnia is regarded as a special case of this family, in that
it has accidental atomic degeneracy because all anions are oxygen. The theory
is also correlated to the seven-coordination theory that explains the
ferroelectricity in hafnia from a chemical perspective. In addition, the strain
conditions to promote the ferroelectric phase in hafnia is discussed.

<h3>The effect of cation-disorder on lithium transport in halide superionic  conductors</h3>

<p>Among the chloride-based Li-ion solid electrolytes, Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) have
emerged as potential candidates due to their affordability, moisture stability,
and high ionic conductivity. LZC synthesized by solid-state heating exhibits
limited Li-ion conductivity while the mechanochemical ball-milled material is
more conductive. In this computational study, we integrate thermodynamic
modeling, using cluster-expansion Monte Carlo, and kinetic modeling, using
molecular dynamics, to investigate whether cation disorder can be achieved in
LZC, and how it affects Li-ion transport. Our results indicate that fast Li-ion
conductivity is induced by the activation of Li/vacancy disorder, which itself
depends on the degree of Zr disorder. We find that the very high-temperature
scale at which equilibrium Zr-disorder can form precludes any equilibrium
synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why
only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling leads to good
conductivity. We identify as the critical mechanism the lack of Li/vacancy
disorder near room temperature when Zr is well-ordered. Our simulations further
show that the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature is lowered by Zr
disorder, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room
temperature. The insights obtained from this study raise a challenge for the
large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term
stability of their properties.

<h3>Capturing electronic correlations in electron-phonon interactions in  molecular systems with the GW approximation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08240" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08240</a>
<br>
</p><i>Antonios M. Alvertis, David B. Williams-Young, Fabien Bruneval, Jeffrey B. Neaton</i>
<p>Electron-phonon interactions are of great importance to a variety of physical
phenomena, and their accurate description is an important goal for
first-principles calculations. Isolated examples of materials and molecular
systems have emerged where electron-phonon coupling is enhanced over density
functional theory (DFT) when using the Green's-function-based ab initio GW
method, which provides a more accurate description of electronic correlations.
It is however unclear how general this enhancement is, and how employing
high-end quantum chemistry methods, which further improve the description of
electronic correlations, might further alter electron-phonon interactions over
GW or DFT. Here, we address these questions by computing the renormalization of
the highest occupied molecular orbital energies of Thiel's set of organic
molecules by harmonic vibrations using DFT, GW and equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster calculations. We find that GW can increase the magnitude of the
electron-phonon coupling across this set of molecules by an average factor of
1.1-1.8 compared to DFT, while equation-of-motion coupled-cluster leads to an
increase of 1.4-2. The electron-phonon coupling predicted with the ab initio GW
method is generally in much closer agreement to coupled cluster values compared
to DFT, establishing GW as an accurate way of computing electron-phonon
phenomena in molecules and beyond at a much lower computational cost than
higher-end quantum chemistry techniques.

<p>This study delves into the magneto-electronic and magneto-optical properties
of stacking-modulated bilayer graphene. By manipulating domain walls (DWs)
across AB-BA domains periodically, we unveil oscillatory Landau subbands and
the associated optical excitations. The DWs act as periodic potentials,
yielding fascinating 1D spectral features. Our exploration reveals 1D phenomena
localized to Bernal stacking, DW regions, and stacking boundaries, highlighting
the intriguing formation of Landau state quantization influenced by the
commensuration between the magnetic length and the system. The stable quantized
localization within different regions leads to the emergence of unconventional
quantized subbands. This study provides valuable insights into the essential
properties of stacking-modulated bilayer graphene.

<h3>Experimental observation of gapped shear waves and liquid-like to  gas-like dynamical crossover in active granular matter</h3>

<p>Unlike crystalline solids, liquids do not exhibit long-range order. Their
atoms undergo frequent structural rearrangements, resulting in the
long-wavelength dynamics of shear fluctuations in liquids being diffusive,
rather than propagating waves, as observed in crystals. When considering
shorter time and length scales, molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical
propositions suggest that collective shear excitations in liquids display a gap
in wave-vector space, referred to as the $k$-gap. Above this gap, solid-like
transverse waves re-emerge. However, direct experimental verification of this
phenomenon in classical liquids remains elusive, with the only documented
evidence from studies in two-dimensional dusty plasmas. Active granular systems
provide a novel platform for exploring the emergence of collective dynamics and
showcasing a rich interplay of complex phases and phenomena. Our study focuses
on bi-disperse active Brownian vibrators. Through measurements of the pair
correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation
functions, vibrational density of states, and a detailed analysis of
microscopic atomic motion, we demonstrate that this active system exhibits both
gas-like and liquid-like phases, depending on the packing fraction, despite
pure hard-disk-like repulsive interactions. Notably, within the granular
liquid-like phase, we experimentally validate the existence of a $k$-gap in the
dispersion of transverse excitations. This gap becomes more significant with a
decrease in packing fraction and disappears into the gas phase, aligning with
theoretical expectations. Our results offer a direct experimental confirmation
of the $k$-gap phenomenon, extending its relevance beyond classical thermal
liquids to active granular systems, and reveal the existence of intriguing
similarities between the physics of active granular matter and supercritical
fluids.

<h3>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in  lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</h3>

<p>Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate
physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on
water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted
molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species,
dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they
are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond)
acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of
water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the
influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K,
the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms
acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5
to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding
dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed
shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle
control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.

<p>Polarizing optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry are used
to determine the phase sequence of three liquid crystalline
4-pentylphenyl-4'-n-alkyloxythiobenzoates with n = 9, 10, 11. The X-ray
diffraction method is applied for structural characterization of the liquid
crystalline phases. The smectic layer spacing, tilt angle, average distance
between the long axes of molecules and correlation length of the short-range
order are determined as a function of temperature. For the crystal-like smectic
phases with hexagonal or herring-bone packing, the unit cell parameters are
obtained. The presence of the tilted hexagonal phase for n = 10, 11 and tilted
herring-bone phase for n = 9, 10 is indicated, although the direction of the

<p>Cobalt disilicide provides a promising nearly-epitaxial superconducting
material on silicon, which is compatible with high-density integrated circuit
technology. We have characterized CoSi$_{2}$ superconducting microwave cavities
around 5.5 GHz for resonance frequency fluctuations at temperatures 10 - 200
mK. We found relatively weak fluctuations $(\delta f/f)^2$ following the
spectral density $A/f^{\gamma} $, with $A \simeq 6 \times 10^{-16}$ and
$\gamma$ slightly below 1 at an average number of photons of $10^4$; the noise
decreased with measurement power as $1/P^{1/2}$. We identify the noise as
arising from kinetic inductance fluctuations and discuss possible origins of
such fluctuations.

<h3>Geometric and electronic properties of two kinds of CrO2 magnetic  monolayers: D3d and D2h phases</h3>

</p><i>Yang Zhang, Xianggong Bo, Jimeng Jing, Lixia Wang, Shiqian Qiao, Hong Wu, Yong Pu, Feng Li</i>
<p>Due to the high magnetic coupling strength between the Cr elements, the bulk
phase CrO2 is one of several ferromagnetic oxides known to have the highest
Curie temperature. When the dimensionality of the material is reduced from 3D
to 2D, the 2D CrO2 system material is expected to maintain a high Curie
temperature. In this work, we predict two new phases of CrO2 monolayer (D3d and
D2h) by using first-principles calculations. We have found that the Curie
temperature of 2D CrO2 is much lower than that of its bulk phase, but still
remains as high as 191K, which is comparable to that of Fe2Cr2Ge6. In addition,
1L D3d-CrO2 is in the ferromagnetic state, while 1L D2h-CrO2 is in the
antiferromagnetic state. Also, the different geometric structure affects its
electrical properties: the 1L D3d-CrO2 is a half-metal while 1L D2h-CrO2 is a
semiconductor. Our studies have shown that there is a wealth of electrical and
magnetic properties in CrO2.

<p>How a closed system thermalizes, especially in the absence of global
conservation laws but in the presence of disorder and interactions, is one of
the central questions in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We explore this
for a disordered, periodically driven Ising chain. Our numerical results reveal
inhomogeneous thermalization leading to a distribution of thermalization
timescales within a single disordered sample, which we encode via a
distribution of effective local temperatures. Using this, we find an excellent
collapse $\textit{without}$ $\textit{any}$ $\textit{fitting}$
$\textit{parameters}$ of the local relaxation dynamics for the entire range of
disorder values in the ergodic regime when adapting the disorder-averaged
diagonal entanglement entropy as internal `time' of the system. This approach
evidences a remarkably uniform parametrization of the dynamical many-body
evolution of local temperature within the otherwise highly heterogeneous
ergodic regime, independent of the strength of the disorder.

<h3>Chiral spin state and nematic ferromagnet in the spin-1 Kitaev-$Γ$  model</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08382" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08382</a>
<br>
</p><i>Qiang Luo, Jize Zhao, Jinbin Li, Xiaoqun Wang</i>
<p>The higher-spin Kitaev magnets, in which the Kitaev interaction and
off-diagonal exchange couplings are overwhelmingly large, have emerged as a
fertile avenue to explore exotic phases and unusual excitations. In this work,
we study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-1 Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model on the
honeycomb lattice using density-matrix renormalization group. It harbours six
distinct phases and the intriguing findings are three magnetically ordered
phases in which both time-reversal symmetry and lattice symmetry albeit of
different sort are broken spontaneously. The chiral spin state originates from
the order-by-disorder effect and exhibits an almost saturated scalar spin
chirality at the quantum level. Depending on the relative strength of the two
interactions, it also features columnar or plaquette valence-bond-solid-like
pattern as a consequence of the translational symmetry breaking. In parallel,
the nematic ferromagnets are situated at ferromagnetic Kitaev side and possess
small but finite ferromagnetic ordering. The lattice-rotational symmetry
breaking enforces nonequivalent bond energy along one of the three bonds.
Although the intrinsic difference between the two nematic ferromagnets remains
elusive, the discontinuities in the von Neumann entropy, hexagonal plaquette
operator, and Wilson loop operator convincingly suggest that they are separated
via a first-order phase transition.

</p><i>Dario A. Leon, Cana Elgvin, Phuong Dan Nguyen, Øystein Prytz, Fredrik S. Hage, Kristian Berland</i>
<p>We present a detailed study of the dielectric response of ZnO using a
combination of low-loss momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy
(EELS) and first-principles calculations at several levels of theory, from the
independent particle and the random phase approximation with different variants
of density functional theory (DFT), including hybrid and DFT$+U$ schemes; to
the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). We use a method based on the $f$-sum rule to
obtain the momentum-resolved experimental loss function and absorption spectra
from EELS measurements. We characterize the main features in the direct and
inverse dielectric functions of ZnO and their dispersion, associating them to
single-particle features in the electronic band structure, while highlighting
the important role of many-body effects such as plasmons and excitons. We
discuss different signatures of the high anisotropy in the response function of
ZnO, including the symmetry of the excitonic wave-functions.

</p><i>Garry Goldstein</i>
<p>In this work we extend the idea of the meanfield. Meanfields approximately
map - through some self consistency relation - a complex, usually manybody,
problem to a simpler more readily solvable problem. Prototypical examples of
simpler meanfield problem (meanfield systems) are the single site and free
particle problems - which are solvable. Here we propose a new class of simple
meanfield systems where the simple problem to be solved is a 1D spin chain.
These meanfields are particularly useful for studying quasi-1D models. We
illustrate this idea by considering meanfields for the Ising and ferromagnetic
Heisenberg models with one direction coupled much more strongly then the other
directions (quasi-1D systems) which map at meanfield level onto the 1D Ising
and 1D ferromagnetic Heisenberg models. Magnetic phase transition temperatures
and are obtained for both models.

<p>Two-dimensional semiconductors based on transition metal dichalcogenides are
promising for electronics and optoelectronics applications owing to their
properties governed by strongly-bound bright and dark excitons.
Momentum-forbidden dark excitons have recently received attention as better
alternatives to bright excitons for long-range transport. However, accessing
the dynamics of dark excitons is challenging experimentally. The most direct,
but very complicated, experiment is transient angle-resolved photoemission
electron spectroscopy: sub-100-fs formation of K-$\Lambda$-excitons in
monolayer WS$_2$ has been identified previously taking advantage of momentum
resolution of detected signals [1]. Here, we use a simpler setting of transient
photoemission electron microscopy (with spatial resolution of 75 nm), which is
inherently sensitive to dark K-$\Lambda$ excitons in monolayers of transition
metal dichalcogenide and has exceptionally high temporal resolution of 13 fs.
We are able to directly observe intervalley scattering (dark-exciton formation)
in monolayer WS$_2$ with scattering rates in the range of 14-50 fs followed by
picosecond-scale dynamics mediated by defects.

<h3>Topology of Discrete Quantum Feedback Control</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Masaya Nakagawa, Masahito Ueda</i>
<p>A general framework for analyzing topology of quantum channels of
single-particle systems is developed to find a class of genuinely dynamical
topological phases that can be realized by means of discrete quantum feedback
control. We provide a symmetry classification of quantum channels by
identifying ten symmetry classes of discrete quantum feedback control with
projective measurements. We construct various types of topological feedback
control by using topological Maxwell's demons that achieve robust
feedback-controlled chiral or helical transport against noise and decoherence.
Topological feedback control thus offers a versatile tool for creating and
controlling nonequilibrium topological phases in open quantum systems that are
distinct from non-Hermitian and Lindbladian systems and should provide a
guiding principle for topology-based design of quantum feedback control.

</p><i>Sergey Belan</i>
<p>Poisson restart assumes that a stochastic process is interrupted and starts
again at random time moments. A number of studies have demonstrated that this
strategy may minimize the expected completion time in some classes of random
search tasks. What is more, it turned out that under optimally tuned restart
rate, any stochastic process, regardless of its nature and statistical details,
satisfies a number of universal relations for the statistical moments of
completion time. In this paper, we describe several new universal properties of
optimally restarted processes. Also we obtain a universal inequality for the
quadratic statistical moments of completion time in the optimization problem
where stochastic process has several possible completion scenarios.

<h3>Theoretical limits of magnetic detection of structural surface defects  at the nanometer scale</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Wolfgang Körner, Daniel F. Urban, Christian Elsässer</i>
<p>We present a theoretical study on the magnetic signals of structural surface
defects like cracks or indents combined with rough surfaces or subsurface
inclusions of soft ferromagnetic metals like body-centered cubic Fe or
amorphous CoFeB. We discuss limits of early detection of small surface defects
on the basis of calculated magnetic stray fields few tens of nm above the
surface. The considered surface imperfections have extensions of a few nm which
correspond to low multiples of the magnetic exchange lengths of Fe or CoFeB.
The detection of such small inhomogeneities requires that the sensor is about
as close to the surface as the size of the inhomogeneity is. Furthermore, the
step width of a scanning sensor must be of the same size as well. Both these
requirements may be fulfilled for instance by scanning microscopy with diamond
nitrogen-vacancy-center quantum sensors.

<h3>Superfluid fraction of interacting bosonic gases</h3>

<p>The superfluid fraction $f$ of a quantum fluid is defined in terms of the
response of the system to a weak and constant drag. Notably, Leggett long ago
derived two simple expressions providing a rigorous upper bound and a heuristic
lower bound for $f$. Here we study the superfluid fraction of bosonic gases in
various two-dimensional potentials, such as regular optical lattices and
disordered speckles, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and performing
Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations. We show that under conditions relevant for
most ultracold experiments the bounds proposed by Leggett provide a
surprisingly narrow bracketing of the exact value of the superfluid fraction.

<h3>Modelling of initially stressed solids: structure of the energy density  in the incompressible limit</h3>

<br>
</p><i>M. Magri, D. Riccobelli</i>
<p>This study addresses the modelling of elastic bodies, particularly when the
relaxed configuration is unknown or non-existent. We adopt the theory of
initially stressed materials, incorporating the deformation gradient and stress
state of the reference configuration (initial stress tensor) into the response
function. We show that for the theory to be applicable, the response function
of the relaxed material is invertible up to an element of the material symmetry
group. Additionally, we establish that commonly imposed constitutive
restrictions, namely the initial stress compatibility condition and initial
stress reference independence, naturally arise when assuming an initial stress
generated solely from elastic distortion. The paper delves into modelling
aspects concerning incompressible materials, showcasing the expressibility of
strain energy density as a function of the deviatoric part of the initial
stress tensor and the isochoric part of the deformation gradient. This not only
reduces the number of independent invariants in the energy functional, but also
enhances numerical robustness in finite element simulations. The findings of
this research hold significant implications for modelling materials with
initial stress, extending potential applications to areas such as
mechanobiology, soft robotics, and 4D printing.

<h3>How motility drives the glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial  monolayers?</h3>

<p>As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the
cellular monolayer undergoes a glass transition from a solid-like jammed to a
fluid-like flowing state. Two primary characteristics of these systems,
confluency, and self-propulsion, make them distinct from particulate systems.
Are the glassy dynamics in these biological systems and equilibrium particulate
systems different? Despite the biological significance of glassiness in these
systems, no analytical framework, which is indispensable for deeper insights,
exists. Here, we extend one of the most popular theories of equilibrium
glasses, the random first-order transition (RFOT) theory, for confluent systems
with self-propulsion. One crucial result of this work is that, unlike in
particulate systems, the confluency affects the effective persistence
time-scale of the active force, described by its rotational diffusion
$D_r^{\text{eff}}$. Unlike in particulate systems, this value differs from the
bare rotational diffusion of the active propulsion force due to cell shape
dynamics which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal
to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small, and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We present
simulation results for the glassy dynamics in active confluent models and find
that the results are consistent with existing experimental data, and conform
remarkably well with our theory. In addition, we show that the theoretical
predictions agree nicely with and explain previously published simulation
results. Our analytical theory provides a foundation for rationalizing and a
quantitative understanding of various glassy characteristics of these
biological systems.

</p><i>Kevin Höllring, Nataša Vučemilović-Alagić, David M. Smith, Ana-Sunčana Smith</i>
<p>Hypothesis: Ionic liquids have various applications in catalytic reaction
environments. In those systems, their interaction with interfaces is key to
their performance as a liquid phase. We hypothesize that the way a monolayer
ionic liquid phase interacts with interfaces like a sapphire substrate is
significantly dependent on temperature and that critical behavior can be
observed in the structural properties of the liquid film.
Methods and simulations: We perform molecular dynamics simulations of
imidazolium-based ionic liquid monolayers deposited on a sapphire substrate at
temperatures from 200K to 400K. We develop computational tools to analyze
structural properties of molecular arrangement in the monolayer, the structure
of the film and the defects spontaneously forming and healing.
Findings: We observe a clear structural phase transition at around 300K from
a solid-like to a liquid-like behavior of a film. Below the critical point an
alternating crystalline structure of cations and anions with alignment of
periodic vectors with the underlying substrate grid is observed, with frozen
defects. Above the critical temperature, the pattern becomes isotropic within
the contact layer that displays dynamic defects of a characteristic size. Our
results highlight the importance of confinement to the phase behavior of the
system.

<p>Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is an ideal X-ray spectroscopy
method to push the combination of energy and time resolutions to the Fourier
transform ultimate limit, because it is unaffected by the core-hole lifetime
energy broadening. And in pump-probe experiments the interaction time is made
very short by the same core-hole lifetime. RIXS is very photon hungry so it
takes great advantage from high repetition rate pulsed X-ray sources like the
European XFEL. The hRIXS instrument is designed for RIXS experiments in the
soft X-ray range with energy resolution approaching the Fourier and the
Heisenberg limits. It is based on a spherical grating with variable line
spacing (VLS) and a position-sensitive 2D detector. Initially, two gratings are
installed to adequately cover the whole photon energy range. With optimized
spot size on the sample and small pixel detector the energy resolution can be
better than 40 meV at any photon energy below 1000 eV. At the SCS instrument of
the European XFEL the spectrometer can be easily positioned thanks to air-pads
on a high-quality floor, allowing the scattering angle to be continuously
adjusted over the 65-145 deg range. It can be coupled to two different sample
interaction chamber, one for liquid jets and one for solids, each equipped at
the state-of-the-art and compatible for optical laser pumping in collinear
geometry. The measured performances, in terms of energy resolution and count
rate on the detector, closely match design expectations. hRIXS is open to
public users since the summer of 2022.

<p>Collective cellular movement plays a crucial role in many processes
fundamental to health, including development, reproduction, infection, wound
healing, and cancer. The emergent dynamics that arise in these systems are
typically thought to depend on how cells interact with one another and the
mechanisms used to drive motility, both of which exhibit remarkable diversity
across different biological systems. Here, we report experimental evidence of a
universal feature in the patterns of flow that spontaneously emerges in groups
of collectively moving cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that the flows
generated by collectively moving dog kidney cells, human breast cancer cells,
and by two different strains of pathogenic bacteria, all exhibit conformal
invariance. Remarkably, not only do our results show that all of these very
different systems display robust conformal invariance, but we also discovered
that the precise form of the invariance in all four systems is described by the
Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE), and belongs to the percolation universality
class. A continuum model of active matter can recapitulate both the observed
conformal invariance and SLE form found in experiments. The presence of
universal conformal invariance reveals that the macroscopic features of living
biological matter exhibit universal translational, rotational, and scale
symmetries that are independent of the microscopic properties of its
constituents. Our results show that the patterns of flows generated by diverse
cellular systems are highly conserved and that biological systems can
unexpectedly be used to experimentally test predictions from the theories for
conformally invariant structures

</p><i>Shinnosuke Koyama, Joji Nasu</i>
<p>We propose a theory for thermal Hall transport mediated by magnons to address
the impact of their damping resulting from magnon-magnon interactions in
insulating magnets. This phenomenon is anticipated to be particularly
significant in systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations,
exemplified by spin-1/2 systems. Employing a nonlinear flavor-wave theory, we
analyze a general model for localized electron systems and develop a
formulation for thermal conductivity based on a perturbation theory, utilizing
bosonic Green's functions with a nonzero self-energy. We derive the expression
of the thermal Hall conductivity incorporating magnon damping. To demonstrate
the applicability of the obtained representation, we adopt it to two $S=1/2$
quantum spin models on a honeycomb lattice. In calculations for these systems,
we make use of the self-consistent imaginary Dyson equation approach at finite
temperatures for evaluating the magnon damping rate. In both systems, the
thermal Hall conductivity is diminished due to the introduction of magnon
damping over a wide temperature range. This effect arises due to the smearing
of magnon spectra with nonzero Berry curvatures. We also discuss the relation
to the damping of chiral edge modes of magnons. Our formulation can be applied
to various localized electron systems as we begin with a general Hamiltonian
for these systems. Our findings shed light on a new aspect of topological
magnonics emergent from many-body effects and will stimulate further
investigations on the impact of magnon damping on topological phenomena.

</p><i>Andrey S. Plyashechnik, Alexey A. Sokolik, Yurii E. Lozovik</i>
<p>We consider Bose-Einstein condensation of noninteracting homogeneous
three-dimensional gas in canonical ensemble when both particle number $N$ and
total momentum $\mathbf{P}$ of all particles are fixed. Using the saddle point
method, we derive the large-$N$ analytical approximations for partition
function, free energy, and statistical distributions of occupation numbers of
different single-particle energy levels. At temperatures below the critical
point of phase transition, we predict, in some ranges of $\mathbf{P}$,
fragmentation of the condensate, when more than one single-particle level is
macroscopically occupied. The occupation number distributions have
approximately Gaussian shapes for the levels hosting the condensate, and
exponential shapes for other, noncondensate levels. Our analysis demonstrates
breaking of Galilean invariance of moving finite-temperature many-particle
system in the presence of Bose-Einstein condensation and extends the theory of
moving and rotating quantum systems to the finite-temperature large-$N$ limit.

<h3>Study of Physical Characteristics of the New Half-Heusler Alloy BaHgSn  by DFT Analysis</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08483</a>
<br>
</p><i>A. Jabar, S. Benyoussef, L. Bahmad</i>
<p>To investigate the physical characteristics of the half-Heusler BaHgSn
molecule, we used theoretical calculations within the Density Functional Theory
(DFT) framework utilizing the LSDA+mBJ technique in this study. Using the
optimal lattice parameters, we discover that half-Heusler BaHgSn exhibits a
Dirac semimetal behavior with a band gap of 0.1 eV. Thomas Charpin's numerical
first-principles calculation approach was applied to determine the elastic
constants of hexagonal BaHgSn alloys. The material's optical characteristics
verified its prospective use in infrared-visible devices. According to a
thermo-electric properties analysis, at 20x10^18 {\Omega}-1.m-1.s-1, the
electrical conductivity reaches its maximum after increasing gradually up to
500 K. Compared to other compounds, these results indicate that BaHgSn has
potential for use in opto-electronic and thermo-electric devices.

<h3>Sharp detection of the onset of Floquet heating using eigenstate  sensitivity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08490" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08490</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sourav Bhattacharjee, Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Anatoli Polkovnikov</i>
<p>Chaotic Floquet systems at sufficiently low driving frequencies are known to
heat up to an infinite temperature ensemble in the thermodynamic limit. However
at high driving frequencies, Floquet systems remain energetically stable in a
robust prethermal phase with exponentially long heating times. We propose
sensitivity (susceptibility) of Floquet eigenstates against infinitesimal
deformations of the drive, as a sharp and sensitive measure to detect this
heating transition. It also captures various regimes (timescales) of Floquet
thermalization accurately. Particularly, we find that at low frequencies near
the onset of unbounded heating, Floquet eigenstates are maximally sensitive to
perturbations and consequently the scaled susceptibility develops a sharp
maximum. We further connect our results to the relaxation dynamics of local
observables to show that near the onset of Floquet heating, the system is
nonergodic with slow glassy dynamics despite being nonintegrable at all driving
frequencies.

<p>Recent theoretical studies have suggested that transition metal perovskite
oxide membranes can enable surface phonon polaritons in the infrared range with
low loss and much stronger subwavelength confinement than bulk crystals. Such
modes, however, have not been experimentally observed so far. Here, using a
combination of far-field Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and
near-field synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS) imaging, we study the
phonon-polaritons in a 100 nm thick freestanding crystalline membrane of SrTiO3
transferred on metallic and dielectric substrates. We observe a
symmetric-antisymmetric mode splitting giving rise to epsilon-near-zero and
Berreman modes as well as highly confined (by a factor of 10) propagating
phonon polaritons, both of which result from the deep-subwavelength thickness
of the membranes. Theoretical modeling based on the analytical finite-dipole
model and numerical finite-difference methods fully corroborate the
experimental results. Our work reveals the potential of oxide membranes as a
promising platform for infrared photonics and polaritonics.

<h3>Small field chaos in spin glasses: universal predictions from the  ultrametric tree and comparison with numerical simulations</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08503" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08503</a>
<br>
</p><i>Miguel Aguilar-Janita, Silvio Franz, Victor Martin-Mayor, Javier Moreno-Gordo, Giorgio Parisi, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Juan J. Ruiz-Lorenzo</i>
<p>We study the chaotic behavior of the Gibbs state of spin-glasses under the
application of an external magnetic field, in the crossover region where the
field intensity scales proportional to $1/\sqrt{N}$, being $N$ the system size.
We show that Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) theory provides universal
predictions for chaotic behavior: they depend only on the zero-field overlap
probability function $P(q)$ and are independent of other features of the
system. Using solely $P(q)$ as input we can analytically predict quantitatively
the statistics of the states in a small field. In the infinite volume limit,
each spin-glass sample is characterized by an infinite number of states that
have a tree-like structure. We generate the corresponding probability
distribution through efficient sampling using a representation based on the
Bolthausen-Snitmann coalescent. In this way, we can compute quantitatively
properties in the presence of a magnetic field in the crossover region, the
overlap probability distribution in the presence of a small field and the
degree of decorrelation as the field is increased. To test our computations, we
have simulated the Bethe lattice spin glass and the 4D Edwards-Anderson model,
finding in both cases excellent agreement with the universal predictions.

<h3>Stability of Weyl node merging processes under symmetry constraints</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Gabriele Naselli, György Frank, Dániel Varjas, Ion Cosma Fulga, Gergő Pintér, András Pályi, Viktor Könye</i>
<p>Changes in the number of Weyl nodes in Weyl semimetals occur through merging
processes, usually involving a pair of oppositely charged nodes. More
complicated processes involving multiple Weyl nodes are also possible, but they
typically require fine tuning and are thus less stable. In this work, we study
how symmetries affect the allowed merging processes and their stability,
focusing on the combination of a two-fold rotation and time-reversal
($C_2\mathcal{T}$) symmetry. We find that, counter-intuitively, processes
involving a merging of three nodes are more generic than processes involving
only two nodes. Our work suggests that multi-Weyl-merging may be observed in a
large variety of quantum materials, and we discuss SrSi$_2$ and bilayer
graphene as potential candidates

<h3>Empirical Band-Gap Correction for LDA-Derived Atomic Effective  Pseudopotentials</h3>

</p><i>Surender Kumar, Hanh Bui, Gabriel Bester</i>
<p>Atomic effective pseudopotentials enable atomistic calculations at the level
of accuracy of density functional theory for semiconductor nanostructures with
up to fifty thousand atoms. Since they are directly derived from ab-initio
calculations performed in the local density approximation (LDA), they inherit
the typical underestimated band gaps and effective masses. We propose an
empirical correction based on the modification of the non-local part of the
pseudopotential and demonstrate good performance for bulk binary materials
(InP, ZnS, HgTe, GaAs) and quantum dots (InP, CdSe, GaAs) with diameters
ranging from 1.0 nm to 4.45 nm. Additionally, we provide a simple analytic
expression to obtain accurate quasiparticle and optical band gaps for InP,
CdSe, and GaAs QDs, from standard LDA calculation.

<h3>Heterogeneous Nucleation and Growth of Sessile Chemically Active  Droplets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08555" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08555</a>
<br>
</p><i>Noah Ziethen, David Zwicker</i>
<p>Droplets are essential for spatially controlling biomolecules in cells. To
work properly, cells need to control the emergence and morphology of droplets.
On the one hand, driven chemical reactions can affect droplets profoundly. For
instance, reactions can control how droplets nucleate and how large they grow.
On the other hand, droplets coexist with various organelles and other
structures inside cells, which could affect their nucleation and morphology. To
understand the interplay of these two aspects, we study a continuous field
theory of active phase separation. Our numerical simulations reveal that
reactions suppress nucleation while attractive walls enhance it. Intriguingly,
these two effects are coupled, leading to shapes that deviate substantially
from the spherical caps predicted for passive systems. These distortions result
from anisotropic fluxes responding to the boundary conditions dictated by the
Young-Dupr\'e equation. Interestingly, an electrostatic analogy of chemical
reactions confirms these effects. We thus demonstrate how driven chemical
reactions affect the emergence and morphology of droplets, which could be
crucial for understanding biological cells and improving technical
applications, e.g., in chemical engineering.

<p>Heat-to-charge conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials is closely
linked to the entropy per charge carrier. Thus, magnetic materials are
promising building blocks for highly efficient energy harvesters, as their
carrier entropy is boosted by a spin degree of freedom. In this work, we
investigate how this spin entropy impacts heat-to-charge conversion in A-type
antiferromagnet CrSBr. We perform simultaneous measurements of electrical
conductance and thermocurrent while changing magnetic order using temperature
and magnetic field as tuning parameters. We find a strong enhancement of the
thermoelectric power factor around the N\'eel temperature. We further reveal
that the power factor at low temperature can be increased by up to 600% upon
applying a magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that the thermoelectric
properties of 2D magnets can be optimized by exploiting the sizeable impact of
spin entropy and confirm thermoelectric measurements as a sensitive tool to
investigate subtle magnetic phase transitions in low-dimensional magnets.

<p>Achieving a correlative measurement of both magnetic and atomic structures at
the nanoscale is imperative to understand the fundamental magnetism of matters
and for fostering the development of new magnetic nanomaterials. Conventional
microscopy methods fall short in providing the two information simultaneously.
Here, we develop a new approach to simultaneously map the magnetic field and
atomic structure at the nanoscale using Lorentz 4-dimensional scanning
transmission electron microscopy (Ltz-4D-STEM). This method enables precise
measurement of the characteristic atomic and magnetic structures across an
extensive field of view, a critical aspect for investigating real-world
ferromagnetic materials. It offers a comprehensive visualization and
statistical evaluation of the different structural information at a
pixel-by-pixel correlation. The new method allows to directly visualize the
magnetoelastic coupling and the resulting complex magnetization arrangement as
well as the competition between magnetoelastic and magnetostatic energy. This
approach opens new avenues for in-depth studying the structure-property
correlation of nanoscale magnetic materials.

<p>An improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and its
superiority over standard particle swarm optimization algorithm is tested on
two typical benchmark functions. By employing this algorithm to search for the
magnetic ground states of the Hubbard model on the real-space square lattice
with finite size based on the mean-field approximation, two new magnetic
states, namely the double striped-type antiferromagnetic state and the triple
antiferromagnetic state, are found. We further perform mean-field calculations
in the thermodynamical limit to confirm that these two new magnetic states are
not a result of a finite-size effect, where the properties of the double
striped-type antiferromagnetic state are also presented.

</p><i>Matteo Masto, Vincent Favre-Nicolin, Steven Leake, Tobias Schülli, Marie-Ingrid Richard, Ewen Bellec</i>
<p>We propose a deep learning algorithm for the inpainting of Bragg Coherent
Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) patterns affected by detector gaps. These regions of
missing intensity can compromise the accuracy of reconstruction algorithms,
inducing artifacts in the final result. It is thus desirable to restore the
intensity in these regions in order to ensure more reliable reconstructions.
The key aspect of our method lies in the choice of training the neural network
with cropped sections of both experimental diffraction data and simulated data
and subsequently patching the predictions generated by the model along the gap,
thus completing the full diffraction peak. This provides us with more
experimental training data and allows for a faster model training due to the
limited size, while the neural network can be applied to arbitrarily larger
BCDI datasets. Moreover, our method not only broadens the scope of application
but also ensures the preservation of data integrity and reliability in the face
of challenging experimental conditions.

<h3>Spin-resolved counting statistics as a sensitive probe of spin  correlation in transport through a quantum dot spin valve</h3>

</p><i>Guanjian Hu, Shikuan Wang, Jing Hu, RuiQiang Li, Yiying Yan, JunYan Luo</i>
<p>We investigate the noise in spin transport through a single quantum dot (QD)
tunnel coupled to ferromagnetic electrodes with noncollinear magnetizations.
Based on a spin-resolved quantum master equation, auto- and cross-correlations
of spin-resolved currents are analyzed to reveal the underlying spin transport
dynamics and characteristics for various polarizations. We find the currents of
majority and minority spins could be strongly autocorrelated despite
uncorrelated charge transfer. The interplay between tunnel coupling and the
Coulomb interaction gives rise to an exchange magnetic field, leading to the
precession of the accumulated spin in the QD. It strongly suppresses the
bunching of spin tunneling events and results in a unique double-peak structure
in the noise of the net spin current. The spin autocorrelation is found to be
susceptible to magnetization alignments, which may serve as a sensitive tool to
measure the magnetization directions between the ferromagnetic electrodes.

<h3>Coupling of quantum-dot states via elastic-cotunneling and crossed  Andreev reflection in a minimal Kitaev chain</h3>

</p><i>Zhi-Hai Liu, Chuanchang Zeng, H. Q. Xu</i>
<p>Recently, exciting progress has been made in using the superconducting
nanowires coupled to gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) to mimic the Kiteav chain
and realize the Majorana-bound states via a poor man's route. The essential
ingredient is to balance the interdot elastic-cotunneling (ECT) and crossed
Andreev reflection (CAR). As theoretically proposed, this can be mediated by
the Andreev bound states (ABSs) formed in the superconducting nanowires.
However, most of the gate-tuning asymmetric features observed in experiments
can not be captured using the current theoretical models. To address this
insufficiency, here, we consider a full model that explicitly includes all the
details of both the QD states and the ABSs. Remarkable agreement is found with
the recent experimental observations, where our model correctly reveals the
gate-tuning asymmetry in ECTs and by which the average QD state energy can also
be extracted. In contrast, CARs do not depend on the tuning of QD states.
Moreover, armed with the tunability of ECTs and CARs with QD states, we also
predict a controllable anisotropic superexchange interaction between electron
spins in the two separated QDs.

</p><i>Junsoo Park, Zhigang Wu, John W. Lawson</i>
<p>We demonstrate an efficient and accurate, general-purpose first-principles
blueprint for calculating anharmonic vibrational free energy and predicting
structural phase transition temperatures of solids. Thermodynamic integration
is performed without molecular dynamics using only interatomic force constants
to model analogues of the true potential and generate their thermal ensembles.
By replacing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) with statistical
sampling of ensemble configurations and trading density-functional theory (DFT)
energy calculations on each configuration for a set of matrix operations, our
approach enables a faster thermodynamic integration by 4 orders of magnitude
over the traditional route via AIMD. Experimental phase transition temperatures
of a variety of strongly anharmonic materials with dynamical instabilities
including shape-memory alloys are recovered to largely within 25% error. Such a
combination of speed and accuracy enables the method to be deployed at a
large-scale for predictive mapping of phase transition temperatures.

<p>Numerous applications, from industrial non-destructive imaging through
ultra-sensitive photon counting to various implementations of solid-state
quantum computers require low temperatures for their sensor and processor
chips. Replacing the bulky cryo-liquid based cooling stages of cryo-enabled
instruments by chip scale refrigeration is envisioned to disruptively reduce
the system size similarly as microprocessors did for computers. Chip scale
cooling has been demonstrated with electronic refrigerators based on tunnel
junctions in the sub-1 K temperature range. Here, we extend the operation
temperature to above 2 K, thereby, bridging the gap between electronic and
pulse tube refrigerators. We report on scalable Al-AlOx-Nb superconducting
tunnel junction cooler technology that can deliver electronic cooling power of
~ mW/mm^2, which is enough to demonstrate significant electron temperature
reduction of 0.82 K against the phonon bath at 2.4 K (34% relative cooling).
Our work shows that the key material of integrated superconducting circuits

time, it introduces a new electro-thermal tool for quantum heat transport

<p>Charge density wave (CDW) systems are proposed to exhibit application
potential for electronic and optoelectronic devices. Therefore, identifying new
materials that exhibit a CDW state at room temperature is crucial for the
development of CDW-based devices. Here, we present a non-layered tetragonal
polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5, which exhibits a CDW state at room temperature.
Gd2Os3Si5 crystallizes in the U2Mn3Si5-type tetragonal crystal structure with
the space group P4/mnc. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis shows
that Gd2Os3Si5 possesses an incommensurately modulated structure with
modulation wave vector q = (0.53, 0, 0), while the modulation reduces the
symmetry to orthorhombic Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0. This differs in contrast to
isostructural Sm2Ru3Ge5, where the modulated phase has been reported to possess
the superspace symmetry Pm({\alpha} 0 {\gamma})0. However, reinvestigation of
Sm2Ru3Ge5 suggests that its modulated crystal structure can alternatively be
described by Cccm({\sigma}00)0s0, with modulations similar to Gd2Os3Si5. The
magnetic susceptibility, \c{hi}(T), exhibits a maximum at low temperatures that
indicates an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 5.5 K. The \c{hi}(T)
furthermore shows an anomaly at around 345 K, suggesting a CDW transition at
TCDW = 345 K, that corroborates the result from high-temperature SXRD
measurements. Interestingly, R2T3X5 compounds are known to crystallize either
in the tetragonal Sc2Fe3Si5 type structure or in the orthorhombic U2Co3Si5
structure type. Not all of the compounds in the R2T3X5 series undergo CDW phase
transitions. We find that R2T3X5 compounds will exhibit a CDW transition, if
the condition : 0.526 < c/sqrt(ab) < 0.543 is satisfied. We suggest the wave
vector-dependent electron-phonon coupling to be the dominant mechanism of CDW
formation in the tetragonal polymorph of Gd2Os3Si5.

</p><i>Robert A. Lawrence</i>
<p>The MBD model of the van der Waals interaction is extended to also consider
magnetic interactions, and it is demonstrated how this can be made to reproduce
the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. It is found that this leads to a weak coupling
between the charge dipole waves that are the basis for the electric-only van
der Waals interaction and the spin-dipole waves (magnons) of the Heisenberg
model. By applying the same level of theory to both simultaneously we
demonstrate that magnons and charge-dipole waves may both be considered to be a
basis for the fluctuating part of the many-body electron density.

<p>We investigate crystal structure and magnetic properties including spin
relaxation and magnetocaloric effect in NASICON type NaFe$_2$PO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_2$
sample. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray and neutron diffraction patterns show
a rhombohedral crystal structure with the R$\bar{3}$c space group. The
core-level spectra confirm the desired oxidation state of constituent elements.
The {\it dc}--magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) behavior in zero field-cooled
(ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes show the ordering temperature $\approx$50~K.
Interestingly, the analysis of temperature dependent neutron diffraction
patterns reveal an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure with the ordered
moment of 3.8 $\mu_{B}$/Fe$^{3+}$ at 5~K, and a magnetostriction below $T_{\rm
N}=$ 50~K. Further, the peak position in the {\it ac}--$\chi$ is found to be
invariant with the excitation frequency supporting the notion of dominating AFM
transition. Also, the unsaturated isothermal magnetization curve supports the
AFM ordering of the moments; however, the observed coercivity suggests the
presence of weak ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at 5~K. On the other hand, a
clear bifurcation between ZFC and FC curves of {\it dc}--$\chi$ and the
observed decrease in peak height of {\it ac}--$\chi$ with frequency suggest for
the complex magnetic interactions. The spin relaxation behavior in
thermo-remanent magnetization and aging measurements indicate the glassy states
at 5~K. Moreover, the Arrott plots and magnetocaloric analysis reveal the
AFM--FM interactions in the sample at lower temperatures.

<p>Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate
an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, characteristic of
Heavy-Fermion physics. Yet, these experiments lack direct evidence of the
existence of local moments associated with the heavy electrons, a key component
of Heavy-Fermion physics. Thermopower serves as a sensitive probe for measuring
entropy and can, therefore, unveil the presence of local moments by assessing
their impact on entropy. In this work, we have carried out comprehensive
thermopower studies on MATBLG by varying temperatures ($T$) and magnetic fields
($B$). While the resistance exhibits prominent resistance peaks at integer
fillings apart from the Dirac point (DP, $\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu
= \pm 4$), the thermopower remains featureless and symmetric to the DP with
opposite signs, in complete violation of the Mott formula, even up to $\sim
100K$. This discrepancy indicates that resistance and thermopower are carried
by different kinds of carriers. With the expected sign changes at the DP and
full band filling, the thermopower demonstrates additional sign changes within
the conduction and valence bands around $\nu \sim \pm 1$, persisting from $5K$
to $50K$. These observations cannot be explained solely by thermopower arising
from an emergent Heavy-Fermion band picture, which is highly sensitive to
temperature. Instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution
coming from the entropy of the localized moments of heavy electrons. To
validate the claim, we studied the thermopower with $B_{\parallel}$ and
$B_{\perp}$, revealing a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, and
attributed to the partial polarization of the local moments (spin/valley),
resulting in decreased entropy. Our results highlight the thermopower
contribution from local moments and establish the Heavy-Fermion physics in
MATBLG.

<h3>The importance of stretching rate in achieving true stress relaxation in  the elasto-capillary thinning of dilute solutions</h3>

<p>This work focuses on inferring the molecular state of the polymer chain
required to induce elasto-capillary stress relaxation and the accurate measure
of the polymer relaxation time in uniaxial stretching of dilute polymer
solutions. This work is facilitated by the discovery that constant velocity
applied at early times leads to initial constant extension rate before reaching
the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Such constant rate experiments are used to
correlate initial stretching kinematics with the thinning dynamics in the
elasto-capillary Regime. We show that there is a minimum initial strain-rate
required to induce rate independent elastic effects. Below the minimum
extension rate, insufficient stretching of the chain is observed before
capillary instability, such that the polymer stress is comparable to the
capillary stress at long times and true stress relaxation is not achieved.
Above the minimum strain-rate, the chain reaches a critical stretch before
instability, such that during the unstable filament thinning the polymer stress
is significantly larger than the capillary stress and true stress relaxation is
observed. Using a single relaxation mode Oldroyd-B model, we show that the the
minimum strain rate leads to a required initial stretch of the chain before
reaching the Rayleigh Plateau limit. Along with the accurate measure of
relaxation time, this work introduces a characteristic dimensionless group,
called the stretchability factor, that can be used to quantitatively compare
different materials based on the overall material deformation/kinematic
behavior, not just the relaxation time. Overall, these results demonstrate a
useful methodology to study the stretching of dilute solutions using a constant
velocity stretching scheme.

<h3>Boundary geometry controls topological defect transitions that determine  lumen nucleation in embryonic development</h3>

<p>Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic
materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood
however, especially in 3D, where bulk-surface coupling can render the geometry
of confining boundaries relevant. This is particularly important in living
matter, where 2D topological defects have been linked to essential biological
functions, whereas the role of 3D defects is unclear. Motivated by
multicellular systems interacting with extracellular boundaries, we consider a
polar fluid confined within curved boundaries imposing weak surface anchoring.
We report a novel charge-preserving transition between different defect
configurations, controlled by the boundary shape, and invariant to changes in
the material parameters. We test if this geometry-driven transition occurs in
confined multicellular systems and investigate the biological role of 3D polar
defects in the mouse epiblast -- an embryonic tissue consisting of
apico-basally polarised cells. We find that fluid-filled lumina -- structures
essential for subsequent embryonic development -- tend to form near defect
positions of polar fluids in embryo-like confinement geometries. Moreover, by
experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we trigger
the formation of additional lumen nucleation sites at the predicted position.
Thus, our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how
embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. Because this
defect control principle is independent of specific material properties, we
expect it to apply universally to systems with orientational order.

<h3>Phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model for arbitrary  spin</h3>

<p>We use the spin functional renormalization group to investigate the
$J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model on a square lattice. By incorporating sum
rules associated with the fixed length of the spin operators as well as the
nontrivial quantum dynamics implied by the spin algebra, we are able to compute
the ground state phase diagram for arbitrary spin $S$, including the quantum
paramagnetic phase at strong frustration. Our prediction for the extent of this
paramagnetic region for $ S = 1/2 $ agrees well with other approaches that are
computationally more expensive. We find that the quantum paramagnetic phase
disappears for $ S \gtrsim 5 $ due to the suppression of quantum fluctuations
with increasing $S$.

<h3>Driving non-trivial quantum phases in conventional semiconductors with  intense excitonic fields</h3>

<p>Inducing novel quantum phases and topologies in materials using intense light
fields is a key objective of modern condensed matter physics, but nonetheless
faces significant experimental challenges. Alternately, theory predicts that in
the dense limit, excitons - collective excitations composed of Coulomb-bound
electron-hole pairs - could also drive exotic quantum phenomena. However, the
direct observation of these phenomena requires the resolution of electronic
structure in momentum space in the presence of excitons, which became possible
only recently. Here, using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
of an atomically thin semiconductor in the presence of a high-density of
resonantly and coherently photoexcited excitons, we observe the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) excitonic state - analogous to the Cooper pairs
of superconductivity. We see the valence band transform from a conventional
paraboloid into a Mexican-hat like Bogoliubov dispersion - a hallmark of the
excitonic insulator phase; and we observe the recently predicted giant
exciton-driven Floquet effects. Our work realizes the promise that intense
bosonic fields, other than photons, can also drive novel quantum phenomena and
phases in materials.

<h3>Light-driven interlayer propagation of collective-mode excitations in  layered superconductors</h3>

<p>Superconductors exhibit a nonlinear interaction with an applied light, which
can resonantly excite the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode. Here we study
light-induced dynamics of layered superconductors, where each layer is coupled
to adjacent layers via the Josephson coupling and the first few layers near the
surface are driven by an in-plane-polarized light. We study the system under
the assumption that the interlayer Coulomb interactions are sufficiently
screened out and that the phase-difference mode becomes available in the
low-energy regime. We find that interlayer transport is induced via excitations
of the collective amplitude and phase-difference modes, even when the applied
electric field is parallel to the planes. We provide analytic calculations as
well as numerical simulations of the real-time dynamics, and investigate the
influence on the light-induced interlayer Josephson current and intralayer
third-harmonic generation.

<h3>Interface Design Beyond Epitaxy: Oxide Heterostructures Comprising  Symmetry-forbidden Interfaces</h3>

<p>Epitaxial growth of thin-film heterostructures is generally considered the
most successful procedure to obtain interfaces of excellent structural and
electronic quality between three-dimensional materials. However, these
interfaces can only join material systems with crystal lattices of matching
symmetries and lattice constants. We present a novel category of interfaces,
the fabrication of which is membrane-based and does not require epitaxial
growth. These interfaces therefore overcome limitations imposed by epitaxy.
Leveraging the additional degrees of freedom gained, we demonstrate atomically
clean interfaces between three-fold symmetric sapphire and four-fold symmetric
SrTiO3. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals structurally well-defined interfaces
with a novel moir\'e-type reconstruction.
