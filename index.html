<h3>Complex Hydrodynamic Interactions and Stokes-Einstein Relation in  Quasi-Two-Dimensional Colloidal Fluids</h3>

Long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions are intrinsic to diverse physical
systems \cite{malvania2021generalized, cao2011universal, kovtun2005viscosity,
bricard2013emergence, cui2004anomalous, riedel2005self, shani2014long} and, in
fact, are the most prominent ones for low Reynold number systems, such as flows
involving micro-organisms and particle-laden suspensions \cite{son2013bacteria,
lauga2016bacterial, riedel2005self, shani2014long}, and protein diffusion
across membranes \cite{vereb2003dynamic, ramadurai2009lateral}. While
hydrodynamics is well-understood in the \textit{far-field} (asymptotic limit)
\cite{cui2004anomalous, molaei2021interfacial, shani2014long}, it has been less
explored in the \textit{near-field} \cite{zhang2021effective}. We
experimentally elucidate the hydrodynamic correlations in quasi-two-dimensional
colloidal fluids in the near-field, uncovering a new filling-the-void mode
formed by the combination of well-known drag and anti-drag hydrodynamic dipolar
modes. These modes superpose, creating a rugged potential landscape for the
diffusing colloids that leads to the violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation
(SER), whose validity is believed to be a hallmark feature of liquids
\cite{einstein1956investigations}. We find pair-wise colloid interactions
unravel complex emergent dynamics due to hydrodynamics, which in contrast to
dynamics emanating from single particles are observed to be anisotropic.
Remarkably, insights gleaned enabled us to pick out the directions unique to
each pair, in which hydrodynamic correlations are the weakest, thereby
recovering the validity of SER along these. Our experiments revealing the
effects of distinct modes of hydrodynamic interactions on SER will have
significant ramifications for fluids' underlying dynamic structure and
transport properties in two dimensions.

<h3>Recent Progress with bioSFQ Circuit Family for Neuromorphic Computing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13657" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13657</a>
<br>
<i>Vasili K. Semenov, Evan B. Golden, Sergey K. Tolpygo</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconductor single flux quantum (SFQ) technology is attractive for
neuromorphic computing due to low energy dissipation and high, potentially up
to 100 GHz, clock rates. We have recently suggested a new family of bioSFQ
circuits (V.K. Semenov et al., IEEE TAS, vol. 32, no. 4, 1400105, 2022) where
information is stored as a value of current in a superconducting loop and
transferred as a rate of SFQ pulses propagating between the loops. This
approach in the simplest case dealing with positive numbers, requires
single-line transfer channels. In the more general case of bipolar numbers, it
requires dual-rail transfer channels. For this need, a new comparator with
dual-rail output has been developed and is presented. This comparator is an
essential part of a bipolar multiplier that has also been designed, fabricated,
and tested. We discuss strategic advantages of the suggested bioSFQ approach,
e.g., an inherently asynchronous character of bioSFQ cells which do not require
explicit clock signals. As a result, bioSFQ circuits are free of racing errors
and tolerant to occasional collision of propagating SFQ pulses. This tolerance
is due to stochastic nature of data signals generated by comparators operating
within their gray zone. The circuits were fabricated in the eight-niobium-layer
fabrication process SFQ5ee developed for superconductor electronics at MIT
Lincoln Laboratory.

Heat transport is a fundamental property of all physical systems and can
serve as a fingerprint identifying different states of matter. In a normal
liquid a hot spot diffuses while in a superfluid heat propagates as a wave
called second sound. Despite its importance for understanding quantum
materials, direct imaging of heat transport is challenging, and one usually
resorts to detecting secondary effects, such as changes in density or pressure.
Here we establish thermography of a strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas, a
paradigmatic system whose properties relate to strongly correlated electrons,
nuclear matter and neutron stars. Just as the color of a glowing metal reveals
its temperature, the radiofrequency spectrum of the interacting Fermi gas
provides spatially resolved thermometry with sub-nanokelvin resolution. The
superfluid phase transition is directly observed as the sudden change from
thermal diffusion to second sound propagation, and is accompanied by a peak in
the second sound diffusivity. The method yields the full heat and density
response of the strongly interacting Fermi gas, and therefore all defining
properties of Landau's two-fluid hydrodynamics. Our measurements serve as a
benchmark for theories of transport in strongly interacting fermionic matter.

<h3>Controlling topological defects and contractile flow in confined nematic  cell population</h3>

<i>Ryo Ienaga, Kazusa Beppu, Yusuke T. Maeda</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological defects in an orientation field play a vital role for controlling
the collective motion of nematic cell populations within epithelia and tissue.
In this study, we study the geometric control of the collective motion in a
nematic cell population to further explore the interplay between topology and
dynamics in active nematics. By applying spatial constraints consisting of two
or three overlapping circle boundaries, we demonstrate an ordered pairing of
half-integer topological defects in a confined cell population. The defects
facing each other can induce a contractile cellular flow at broad geometric
conditions. This robust contractile flow contributes to mechanical stimulation
while altering the cell nucleus, which may be relevant to geometry-dependent
morphogenesis.

We formulate a kinetic theory of quantum information scrambling in the
context of a paradigmatic model of interacting electrons in the vicinity of a
superconducting phase transition. We carefully derive a set of coupled partial
differential equations that effectively govern the dynamics of information
spreading in generic dimensions. They exhibit traveling wave solutions that are
discontinuous at the boundary of the light cone, and have a perfectly causal
structure where the solutions do not spill outside of the light cone.

<h3>Matrix Product Renormalization Group: Potential Universal Quantum  Many-Body Solver</h3>

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a celebrated tensor
network algorithm, which computes the ground states of one-dimensional quantum
many-body systems very efficiently. Here we propose an improved formulation of
continuous tensor network algorithms, which we name a matrix product
renormalization group (MPRG). MPRG is a universal quantum many-body solver,
which potentially works at both zero and finite temperatures, in two and higher
dimensions, and is even applicable to open quantum systems. Furthermore, MPRG
does not rely on any variational principles and thus supports any kind of
non-Hermitian systems in any dimension. As a demonstration, we present critical
properties of the Yang-Lee edge singularity in one dimension as a
representative non-Hermitian system.

<h3>Proximate Dirac spin liquid in the J1-J3 XXZ model for honeycomb  cobaltates</h3>

<br>
<br>
The concerted effort to find materials that host the enigmatic quantum spin
liquid state has shone the spotlight on a variety of honeycomb cobaltates.
While initially proposed as candidate realizations of the elusive Kitaev spin
liquid, ab initio calculations and neutron scattering experiments have
converged on their low energy description being a J1-J3 XXZ spin model with
weak compass anisotropies. Here, we combine exact diagonalization and
density-matrix renormalization group calculations with parton mean field theory
and Gutzwiller wavefunctions, to argue for the presence of a proximate Dirac SL
phase in the phase diagram of this model. This Dirac SL is shown, within parton
mean field theory, to capture the broad continuum seen in the temperature (T )
and magnetic field dependent THz spectroscopy of BaCo2(AsO4)2. Weak disorder or
zig-zag order coexisting with the SL is found to support a metallic thermal
conductivity $\kappa \propto T$ as reported in NaCo2TeO6.

Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) are shape-changing materials that
exhibit large deformations in response to applied stimuli. Local control of the
orientation of LCEs spatially directs the deformation of these materials to
realize spontaneous shape change in response to stimuli. Prior approaches to
shape programming in LCEs utilize patterning techniques that involve the
detailed inscription of spatially varying nematic fields to produce sheets.
These patterned sheets deform into elaborate geometries with complex Gaussian
curvatures. Here, we present an alternative approach to realize shape-morphing
in LCEs where spatial patterning of the crosslink density locally regulates the
material deformation magnitude on either side of a prescribed interface curve.
We also present a simple mathematical model describing the behavior of these
materials. Further experiments coupled with the mathematical model demonstrate
the control of the sign of Gaussian curvature, which is used in combination
with heat transfer effects to design LCEs that self-clean as a result of
temperature-dependent actuation properties.

Single Pulse All Optical Helicity Independent Switching (AO-HIS) represents
the ability to reverse the magnetic moment of a nanostructure using a
femtosecond single laser pulse. It is an ultrafast method to manipulate
magnetization without the use of any applied field. Since the first switching
experiments carried on GdFeCo ferrimagnetic systems, single pulse AO-HIS has
been restricted for a while to Gd-based alloys or Gd/FM bilayers where FM is a
ferromagnetic layer. Only recently has AO-HIS been extended to a few other
materials: MnRuGa ferrimagnetic Heusler alloys and Tb/Co multilayers with a
very specific range of thickness and composition. Here, we demonstrate that
single pulse AO-HIS observed in Tb/Co results from a different mechanism than
the one for Gd based samples and that it can be obtained for a large range of
rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) multilayers, making this phenomenon much
more general. Surprisingly, in this large family of (RE-TM) multilayer systems,
the threshold fluence for switching is observed to be independent of the pulse
duration, up to at least 12 ps. Moreover, at high laser intensities, concentric
ring domain structures are induced, unveiling multiple fluence thresholds.
These striking switching features, which are in contrast to those of AO-HIS in
GdFeCo alloys, concomitant with the demonstration of an in-plane reorientation
of the magnetization, point towards an intrinsic precessional reversal
mechanism. Our results allow expanding the variety of materials with tunable
magnetic properties that can be integrated in complex heterostructures and
provide a pathway to engineer materials for future applications based on
all-optical control of magnetic order.

<h3>Random networks with q-exponential degree distribution</h3>

<br>
<i>Cesar I. N. Sampaio Filho, Marcio M. Bastos, Hans J. Herrmann, André A. Moreira, José S. Andrade Jr</i>
<br>
<br>
We use the configuration model to generate networks having a degree
distribution that follows a $q$-exponential,
$P_q(k)=(2-q)\lambda[1-(1-q)\lambda k]^{1/(q-1)}$, for arbitrary values of the
parameters $q$ and $\lambda$. We study the assortativity and the shortest path
of these networks finding that the more the distribution resembles a pure power
law, the less well connected are the corresponding nodes. In fact, the average
degree of a nearest neighbor grows monotonically with $\lambda^{-1}$. Moreover,
our results show that $q$-exponential networks are more robust against random
failures and against malicious attacks than standard scale-free networks.
Indeed, the critical fraction of removed nodes grows logarithmically with
$\lambda^{-1}$ for malicious attacks. An analysis of the $k_s$-core
decomposition shows that $q$-exponential networks have a highest $k_s$-core,
that is bigger and has a larger $k_s$ than pure scale-free networks. Being at
the same time well connected and robust, networks with $q$-exponential degree
distribution exhibit scale-free and small-world properties, making them a
particularly suitable model for application in several systems.

<h3>Epitaxially Driven Phase Selectivity of Sn in Hybrid Quantum Nanowires</h3>

<br>
<br>
Hybrid semiconductor/superconductor nanowires constitute a pervasive platform
for studying gate-tunable superconductivity and the emergence of topological
behavior. Their low-dimensionality and crystal structure flexibility facilitate
novel heterostructure growth and efficient material optimization; crucial
prerequisites for accurately constructing complex multi-component quantum
materials. Here, we present an extensive optimization of Sn growth on InSb,
InAsSb and InAs nanowires. We demonstrate how the growth conditions and the
crystal structure/symmetry of the semiconductor drive the formation of either
semi-metallic $\mathrm{\alpha-Sn}$ or superconducting $\mathrm{\beta-Sn}$. For
InAs nanowires, we obtain phase-pure, superconducting $\mathrm{\beta-Sn}$
shells. However, for InSb and InAsSb nanowires, an initial epitaxial
$\mathrm{\alpha-Sn}$ phase evolves into a polycrystalline shell of coexisting
$\mathrm{\alpha}$ and $\mathrm{\beta}$ phases, where the $\beta/\alpha$ volume
ratio increases with Sn shell thickness. Whether these nanowires exhibit
superconductivity or not critically relies on the $\mathrm{\beta-Sn}$ content.
Therefore, this work provides key insights into Sn phase control on a variety
of semiconductors, with consequences for the yield of superconducting hybrids
suitable for generating topological systems.

<h3>Impact of Sb degrees of freedom on the charge density wave phase diagram  of the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13319</a>
<br>
<i>Ethan T. Ritz, Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol</i>
<br>
<br>
Elucidating the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the charge density
wave (CDW) instability of the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, K, Rb) family of kagome
metals is critical for understanding their unique properties, including
superconductivity. In these compounds, distinct CDW phases with wave-vectors at
the $M$ and $L$ points are energetically favorable, opening the possibility of
tuning the type of CDW order by appropriate external parameters. Here, we shed
light on the CDW landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ via a combination of
first-principles calculations and phenomenology, which consists of extracting
the coefficients of the CDW Landau free-energy expansion from density
functional theory. We find that while the main structural distortions of the
kagome lattice in the staggered tri-hexagonal CDW phase are along the
nearest-neighbor V-V bonds, distortions associated with the Sb ions play a
defining role in the energy gain in this and all other CDW states. Moreover,
the coupling between ionic displacements from different unit cells is small,
thus explaining the existence of multiple CDW instabilities with different
modulations along the c-axis. We also investigate how pressure and temperature
impact the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Increasing pressure does not change the
staggered tri-hexagonal CDW ground state, even though the $M$-point CDW
instability disappears before the $L$-point one, a behavior that we attribute
to the large nonlinear coupling between the order parameters. Upon changing the
temperature, we find a narrow regime in which another transition can take
place, toward a tri-hexagonal Star-of-David CDW phase. We discuss the
implications of our results by comparing them with experiments on this
compound.

<h3>Natural band alignment of $\rm MgO_{1-x}S_{x}$ alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have calculated formation enthalpies, band gaps, and natural band
alignment for $\rm MgO_{1-x}S_{x}$ alloys by first principles calculation based
on density functional theory. The calculated formation enthalpies show that the
$\rm MgO_{1-x}S_{x}$ alloys exhibit a large miscibilitygap, and a metastable
region was found to occur when the S content was below 18% or over 87%. Effect
of S incorporation for band gaps of $\rm MgO_{1-x}S_{x}$ alloys shows large
bowing parameter (b $ \simeq $ 13 eV) induced. The dependence of the band
lineup of $\rm MgO_{1-x}S_{x}$ alloys on the S content by using two different
methods, and the change in the energy position of valence band maximum (VBM)
was larger than that of conduction band minimum. Based on the calculated VBM
positions, we predicted that $\rm MgO_{1-x}S_{x}$ with S content 10 to 18% can
be surface charge transfer doping by high electron affinity materials. The
present work provides an example to design for p-type oxysulfide materials.

<h3>Field resilient superconductivity in atomic layer crystalline materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13334" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13334</a>

<br>
<br>
The recent study [S. Yoshizawa et al., Nature Communications 12, 1 (2021)]
reported the field resilient superconductivity, that is, the enhancement of an
in-plane critical magnetic field $H^{||}_{\rm c2}$ exceeding the paramagnetic
limiting field in an atomic layer crystalline ($\sqrt{7}\times\sqrt{3}$)-In on
a Si(111) substrate. The present article elucidates the origin of the observed
field resilient noncentrosymmetric superconductivity in the highly crystalline
two dimensional material. We developed the quasiclassical theory by
incorporating the Fermi surface anisotropy together with an anisotropic spin
splitting specific to atomic layer crystalline systems. The enhancement of the
rescaled $H^{||}_{\rm c2}$ by the critical temperature at zero field occurs not
only due to the disorder effect but also to an anisotropic non-ideal Rashba
spin texture depending on the field direction. We also study the parity mixing
effect to show the enhancement of $H^{||}_{\rm c2}$ is limited in the
moderately clean regime because of the fragile $s$-wave pairing against
nonmagnetic scattering in the case of the dominant odd parity component of a
pair wavefunction. Furthermore, from the analysis of the transition line, we
identify the field resilience factor taking account of the scattering and
suppression of paramagnetic effects and discuss the origin of the field
resilient superconductivity. Through the fitting of the $H^{||}_{\rm c2}$ data,
the normal state electron scattering is discussed, mainly focusing on the role
of atomic steps on a Si(111) surface.

<h3>Interrelations among critical current density, irreversibility field and  pseudogap in hole doped high-Tc cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13339</a>

<br>
<br>
The effects of hole content (p) and oxygen deficiency (delta) on the
zero-field critical current density, Jc0, were investigated for high-quality
c-axis oriented Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-delta (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) thin films.
Low temperature critical current density of these films above the optimum
doping were found to be high and were primarily determined by the hole
concentration, reaching a maximum at p ~ 0.185 +/- 0.005, irrespective of the
level of oxygen deficiency. This implies that oxygen disorder plays only a
secondary role and the intrinsic Jc0 is primarily governed by the carrier
concentration in the copper oxide planes. Further support in favor of this was
found from the analysis of the in-plane resistive transitions of c-axis
oriented crystalline thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) under magnetic fields
(H) applied along the c-direction, over a wide range of doped holes. The
characteristic magnetic field (H0), linked to the vortex activation energy and
the irreversibility field, exhibits similar p-dependence as shown by Jc0(p). We
have explained these observations in terms of the doping dependent pseudogap
(PG) in the low-energy electronic energy density of states. Both the intrinsic
critical current density and the irreversibility field depend directly on the
superconducting condensation energy, which in turn is largely controlled by the
magnitude of the hole concentration dependent PG in the quasiparticle spectral
density.

<h3>Accelerated Transport through Sliding Dynamics of Rodlike Particles in  Macromolecular Networks</h3>

<br>
<br>
Transport of rodlike particles in macromolecular networks is critical for
many important biological processes and technological applications. Here, we
report that speeding-up dynamics occurs once the rod length L reaches around
integral multiple of the network mesh size ax. We find that such a fast
diffusion follows the sliding dynamics and demonstrate it to be anomalous yet
Brownian. The good agreement between theoretical analysis and simulations
corroborates that sliding dynamics is an intermediate regime between hopping
and Brownian dynamics, and suggests a mechanistic interpretation based on the
rod-length dependent entropic free energy barrier. These theoretical findings
are captured by the experimental observations of rods in synthetic networks,
and bring new insight into the physics of the transport dynamics in confined
media of networks.

We investigate a bilayer honeycomb lattice model of spin-1/2 fermions at
half-filling with local Heisenberg coupling of fermion spins across the two
layers. Using variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation, we demonstrate that the
system undergoes a direct transition from a Dirac semimetal phase to a
symmetric gapped phase, known as symmetric mass generation (SMG), as the
Heisenberg coupling strength is increased. The transition does not involve
spontaneous symmetry breaking or topological order and has been proposed as an
example of the fermionic deconfined quantum critical point (fDQCP). Our
simulation shows that a fermionic parton bilinear mass opens at the transition
point while all symmetries are still preserved thanks to the quantum
fluctuations introduced by the correlation factor in the variational wave
function. From the simulation data, we extract the critical exponent
$\nu=0.96\pm0.03$ and the fermion scaling dimension $\Delta_c=1.31\pm0.04$ at
the SMG critical point, which are consistent with the field theoretical
prediction of fDQCP in (2+1)D. These findings support the hypothesis that the
fermion fractionalizes at the SMG critical point.

Lower thermal stability due to thinning often leads to unprecedented hidden
phases in low-dimensional materials. Such hidden phases can coexist or compete
with preexisting electronic phases. We investigate hidden phases observed in
atomically thin (6-8 layers) 1T-TaS$_2$ with scanning tunneling microscopy.
First, we can electrically induce a hidden stripe phase at room temperature.
Such a uniaxial stripe phase has three equivalent orientations by breaking
three-fold symmetry of 1T-TaS$_2$. We also reveal that the hidden stripe phase
coexists with nearly commensurate charge-density-wave phase. Next, we observe
that the emergent stripe phase spontaneously appears without any electric
excitation on a tiny flake ($160\times80$ nm$^2$). Our findings may provide a
plausible explanation for the previously observed phase transition and two-fold
optical response in thin 1T-TaS$_2$ devices at room temperature. Furthermore,
the hidden stripe phase would be crucial to understand exotic CDW-related
phenomena in 1T-TaS$_2$ for potential applications.

The energetic positions of molecular electronic states at molecule/electrode
interfaces are crucial factors for determining the transport and optoelectronic
properties of molecular junctions. Strong light--matter coupling offers a
potential for manipulating these factors, enabling to boost in the efficiency
and versatility of these junctions. Here, we investigate electroluminescence
from single-molecule junctions in which the molecule is strongly coupled with
the vacuum electromagnetic field in a plasmonic nanocavity. We demonstrate an
improvement in the electroluminescence efficiency by employing the strong
light--matter coupling in conjunction with the characteristic feature of
single-molecule junctions to selectively control the formation of the
lowest-energy excited state. The mechanism of efficiency improvement is
discussed based on the energetic position and composition of the formed
polaritonic states. Our findings indicate the possibility to manipulate
optoelectronic conversion in molecular junctions by strong light--matter
coupling and contribute to providing design principles for developing efficient
molecular optoelectronic devices.

<br>
<br>
Scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) equipped with pulsed electron spin
resonance (ESR) have paved a way to coherently control individual atomic and
molecular spins on surfaces. A recent breakthrough was to drive ESR of a spin
outside the tunnel junction by locating a single atom magnet in proximity to a
qubit, composing a 'spin-magnet pair'. Here we present a combined experimental
and model study on the ESR driving mechanism in such a spin-magnet pair. Pulsed
ESR of a single hydrogenated Ti atom on MgO with an Fe atom located between 6
and 8 {\AA} away showed a non-vanishing Rabi rate even when the tip is
substantially retracted, comparable in strength with that driven by the
interaction with the tip's magnetic moment under normal tunnel conditions. We
reveal that this ESR driving field is contributed by Fe through the spin-spin
interaction in the pair and show its tunability using a vector magnetic field.
The spin-magnet pair therefore expands ESR-STM to address and coherently
control on-surface atomic and molecular spins independent of the tip's magnetic
apex. Together with existing atom manipulation techniques in STM, our study
establishes a feasible method to design spin-based multi-qubit systems on
surfaces.

Due to the observed superconductivity, the alternating twisted trilayer
graphene (ATTLG) has drawn great research interest very recently, in which
three monolayer graphene (MLG) are stacked in alternating twist way. If one or
several of the MLG in ATTLG are replaced by a multilayer graphene, we get a
double twisted multilayer graphene (DTMLG). In this work, we theoretically
illustrate that, if the DTMLG has a mirror symmetry along z direction like the
ATTLG, there exists a mirror symmetry decomposition (MSD), by which the DTMLG
can be exactly decoupled into two subsystems with opposite parity. The two
subsystems are either a twisted multilayer graphene (single twist) or a
multilayer graphene, depending on the stacking configuration. Such MSD can give
a clear interpretation about all the novel features of the moir\'{e} band
structures of DTMLG, e.g. the fourfold degenerate flat bands and the enlarged
magic angle. Meanwhile, in such DTMLG, the parity becomes a new degree of
freedom of the electrons, so that we can define a parity resolved Chern number
for the moir\'{e} flat bands. More importantly, the MSD implies that all the
novel correlated phases in the twisted multilayer graphene should also exist in
the corresponding DTMLGs, since they have the exact same Hamiltonian in form.
Specifically, according to the MSD, we predict that the superconductivity
should exist in the (1+3+1)-DTMLG.

Couplings between topological edge channels open electronic phases possessing
nontrivial eigenmodes far beyond the noninteracting-edge picture. However,
inelastic scatterings mask the eigenmodes' inherent features, often preventing
us from identifying the phases, as is the case for the quintessential
Landau-level filling factor v = 2/3 edge composed of the counter-propagating v
= 1/3 and 1 (1/3-1) channels. Here, we study the coherent-incoherent crossover
of the 1/3-1 channels by tuning the channel length in-situ using a new device
architecture comprising a junction of v = 1/3 and 1 systems, the particle-hole
conjugate of the 2/3 edge. We successfully observed the concurrence of the
fluctuating electrical conductance and the quantized thermal conductance in the
crossover regime, the definitive hallmark of the eigenmodes in the
disorder-dominated edge phase left experimentally unverified.

<h3>Kinetic Paths of Block Copolymer Particles: Dynamic Self-Consistent  Field Theory Studies</h3>

<i>Yanyan Zhu, Changhang Huang, Liangshun Zhang, David Andelman, Xingkun Man</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the kinetic paths of structural evolution and formation of block
copolymer (BCP) particles using dynamic self-consistent field theory (DSCFT).
We show that the process-directed self-assembly of BCP immersed in a poor
solvent leads to the formation of striped ellipsoids, onion-like particles and
double-spiral lamellar particles. The theory predicts a reversible path of
shape transition between onion-like particles and striped ellipsoidal ones by
regulating the temperature (related to the Flory-Huggins parameter between the
two components of BCP, $\chi_{\rm{AB}}$) and the selectivity of solvent towards
one of the two BCP components. Furthermore, a kinetic path of shape transition
from onion-like particles to double-spiral lamellar particles, and then back to
onion-like particles is demonstrated. By investigating the inner-structural
evolution of a BCP particle, we identify that changing the intermediate
bi-continuous structure into a layered one is crucial for the formation of
striped ellipsoidal particles. Another interesting finding is that the
formation of onion-like particles is characterized by a two-stage microphase
separation. The first is induced by the solvent preference, and the second is
controlled by the thermodynamics. Our findings lead to an effective way of
tailoring nanostructure of BCP particles for various industrial applications,
ranging from sensors to smart coating to drug delivery.

<br>
<br>
Electrostatic charges placed near the interface between ordinary and
topological insulators induce magnetic fields, through the so-called
topological magnetoelectric effect. Here, we present a numerical implementation
of the associated Maxwell equations. The resulting model is simple, fast and
quantitatively as accurate as the image charge method, but with the advantage
of providing easy access to elaborate geometries when pursuing specific
effects. The model is used to study how magnetoelectric fields are influenced
by the dimensions and the shape of the most common semiconductor
nanostructures: quantum wells, quantum wires, quantum dots and quantum rings.
Point-like charges give rise to magnetic fields of the order of mT, whose sign
and spatial orientation is governed by the geometry of the nanostructure and
the location of the charge. The results are rationalized in terms of the Hall
currents induced on the surface, which constitute a simple yet valid framework
for the deterministic design of magnetoelectric fields.

Compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), including high-entropy ceramics
(HECs) as a subclass, offer new opportunities of materials discovery beyond the
traditional methodology of searching new stoichiometric compounds. Herein, we
establish new strategies of tailoring CCCs via a seamless combination of (1)
non-equimolar compositional designs and (2) controlling microstructures and
interfaces. Using oxide solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries as an
exemplar, we validate these new strategies via discovering a new class of
compositionally complex perovskite oxides (CCPOs) to show the possibility of
improving ionic conductivities beyond the limit of conventional doping. As an
example (amongst the 28 CCPOs examined), we demonstrate that the ionic
conductivity can be improved by >60% in
(Li0.375Sr0.4375)(Ta0.375Nb0.375Zr0.125Hf0.125)O3-{\delta}, in comparison with
the state-of-art (Li0.375Sr0.4375)(Ta0.75Zr0.25)O3-{\delta} (LSTZ) baseline,
via maintaining comparable electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ionic
conductivity can be improved by another >70% via grain boundary (GB)
engineering, achieving >270% of the LSTZ baseline. This work suggests
transformative new strategies for designing and tailoring HECs and CCCs,
thereby opening a new window for discovering materials for energy storage and
many other applications.

<h3>High Chern number van der Waals magnetic topological multilayers  MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/hBN</h3>

<br>
<br>
Chern insulators are two-dimensional magnetic topological materials that
conduct electricity along their edges via the one-dimensional chiral modes. The
number of these modes is a topological invariant called the first Chern number
$C$, that defines the quantized Hall conductance as $S_{xy}= C e^2/h$.
Increasing $C$ is pivotal for the realization of low-power-consumption
topological electronics, but there has been no clear-cut solution of this
problem so far, with the majority of existing Chern insulators showing $C=1$.
Here, by using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, we propose an efficient
approach for the realization of the high-$C$ Chern insulator state in
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/hBN van der Waals multilayer heterostructures. We show that a
stack of $n$ MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films with $C=1$ intercalated by hBN monolayers
gives rise to a high Chern number state with $C=n$, characterized by $n$ chiral
edge modes. This state can be achieved both under the external magnetic field
and without it, both cases leading to the quantized Hall conductance $S_{xy}= C
e^2/h$. Our results therefore pave way to practical high-$C$ quantized Hall
systems.

In the topological superconductor with the nematic superconductivity in $E_u$
representation, it is possible to have different types of vortices. One is
associated with the vorticity in the particle-hole space and corresponds to the
Abrikosov vortex. Another type corresponds to the vorticity in the spin space
and is called spin vortex. We study the interaction of the Abrikosov vortex
with the spin vortices. We derive the free energy of the sample with the
Abrikosov and the strain-induced spin vortices using the Ginzburg-Landau
approach for the two-component superconducting order parameter. We calculate
the critical strain at which the spin vortex is formed. We show that the spin
vortex and the Abrikosov vortex attract to each other and, as a result, they
have a common core. We show that there are no zero-energy states (Majorana
fermions) localized near the common vortex core of the Abrikosov vortex and the
spin vortex of any type. Possible experimental realization is discussed.

<br>
<br>
The recent discovery of intrinsic supercurrent diode effect, and its prompt
observation in a rich variety of systems, has shown that nonreciprocal
supercurrents naturally emerge when both space- and time-inversion symmetries
are broken. In Josephson junctions, nonreciprocal supercurrent can be
conveniently described in terms of spin-split Andreev states. Here, we
demonstrate a sign reversal of the supercurrent diode effect, in both its AC
and DC manifestations. In particular, the AC diode effect -- i.e., the
asymmetry of the Josephson inductance as a function of the supercurrent --
allows us to probe the current-phase relation near equilibrium. Using a minimal
theoretical model, we can then link the sign reversal of the AC diode effect to
the so-called 0-$\pi$-like transition, a predicted, but still elusive feature
of multi-channel junctions. Our results demonstrate the potential of inductance
measurements as sensitive probes of the fundamental properties of
unconventional Josephson junctions.

Electron-spin resonance carried out with scanning tunneling microscopes
(ESR-STM) is a recently developed experimental technique that is attracting
enormous interest on account of its potential to carry out single-spin
on-surface resonance with subatomic resolution. Here we carry out a theoretical
study of the role of tip-adatom interactions and provide guidelines for
choosing the experimental parameters in order to optimize spin resonance
measurements. We consider the case of the Fe adatom on a MgO surface and its
interaction with the spin-polarized STM tip. We address three problems: first,
how to optimize the tip-sample distance to cancel the effective magnetic field
created by the tip on the surface spin, in order to carry out proper magnetic
field sensing. Second, how to reduce the voltage dependence of the surface-spin
resonant frequency, in order to minimize tip-induced decoherence due to voltage
noise. Third, we propose an experimental protocol to infer the detuning angle
between the applied field and the tip magnetization, which plays a crucial role
in the modeling of the experimental results.

It was recently demonstrated that, in deep subwavelength gap resonators
coupled to two-dimensional electron gases, coupling to propagating plasmons can
lead to energy leakage and prevent the formation of polaritonic resonances.
This process, akin to Landau damping, limits the achievable field confinement
and thus the value of light-matter coupling strength. In this work, we show how
plasmonic subwavelength reflectors can be used to create an artificial energy
stopband in the plasmon dispersion, confining them and enabling the recovery of
the polaritonic resonances. Using this approach we demonstrate a normalized
light-matter coupling ratio of {\Omega}/{\omega} = 0.35 employing a single
quantum well with a gap size of {\lambda}/2400 in vacuum.

Short-range ordering in cation-disordered cathodes can have a significant
effect on their electrochemical properties. Here, we characterise the cation
short-range order in the antiperovskite cathode material Li$_2$FeSO, using
density functional theory, Monte Carlo simulations, and synchrotron X-ray
pair-distribution-function data. We predict partial short-range
cation-ordering, characterised by favourable OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen coordination
with a preference for polar cis-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ over non-polar
trans-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ configurations. This preference for polar cation
configurations produces long-range disorder, in agreement with experimental
data. The predicted short-range-order preference contrasts with that for a
simple point-charge model, which instead predicts preferential
trans-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen coordination and corresponding long-range
crystallographic order. The absence of long-range order in Li$_2$FeSO can
therefore be attributed to the relative stability of cis-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ and
other non-OLi$_4$Fe$_2$ oxygen-coordination motifs. We show that this effect is
associated with the polarisation of oxide and sulfide anions in polar
coordination environments, which stabilises these polar short-range cation
orderings. We propose similar anion-polarisation-directed short-range-ordering
may be present in other heterocationic materials that contain cations with
different formal charges. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of
using simple point-charge models to predict the structure of cation-disordered
materials, where other factors, such as anion polarisation, may play a critical
role in directing both short- and long-range structural correlations.

Estimating the dissipation, or the entropy production rate (EPR), can provide
insights into the underlying mechanisms of nonequilibrium driven processes.
Experimentally, however, only partial information can be accessed, and the
ability to estimate the EPR varies depending on the available data. Here, we
test different degrees of observed information stemming from coarse-grained
time-series trajectory data, and apply several EPR estimators. Given increasing
amount of information, we show a hierarchy of lower bounds on the total EPR.
Further, we present a novel approach for utilizing waiting times in hidden
states to provide a tighter lower bound on the total EPR.

The mass average interdiffusion coefficient DM is an approximated constant
value of the interdiffusion coefficient which is relevant in the kinetics of
ion exchange in silicate glasses. In this study, it is presented a simple
technique for its determination based on the weight change of a glass sample
after ion exchange. The theoretical basis of the method is presented in detail
together with the approximations assumed in considering the constancy of the DM
. Experimental results are presented for soda-lime silicate glasses and it is
demonstrated the correlation of DM with the ion exchange temperature following
an Arrhenius-type equation with an energy activation barrier and a
pre-exponential factor. The determination of the mass average interdiffusion
coefficient allows the estimation of the compression layer depth when a stress
profile is build-up as a consequence of ion exchange. The estimated values of
the compression layer depth have been compared with the ones measured by an
optical technique based on differential surface refractometry (DSR). Values
have been found quite compatible with the uncertainty limits indicated by the
DSR method.

Heterogeneous materials exhibit anisotropy to varying extent that is
influenced by factors such as individual phase properties and microstructural
configuration. A review of the existing anisotropy measures proposed in the
context of single crystals reveal that they do not account for the material and
microstructural descriptors influencing the extent of anisotropy in
heterogeneous materials. To overcome this limitation, existing anisotropy
indices have been re-interpreted by considering the effective elastic
properties of heterogeneous materials obtained by appropriate effective
property estimates. Anisotropy quantification has been demonstrated considering
two phase composite materials highlighting the role of constituent volume
fractions, secondary phase shape and elastic contrast in influencing the extent
of anisotropy. The proposed approach can be generalized to consider other
physical fields, multiphysics and non-linearity.

<br>
Theoretically, materials that break multiple symmetries allow, under certain
conditions, the formation of four-fermion condensates above the superconducting
critical temperature. Such states can be stabilized by phase fluctuations.
Recently a fermionic quadrupling condensate that breaks the $Z_2$ time-reversal
symmetry was reported in Ba$_{\rm 1-x}$K$_{\rm x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ [V. Grinenko
et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 1254 (2021)]. Evidence for the new state of matter comes
from muon-spin rotation, transport, thermoelectric, and ultrasound experiments.
Observing a specific heat anomaly is a very important signature of a transition
to a new state of matter. However, a fluctuation-induced specific heat
singularity is usually very challenging to resolve from a background of other
contributions. Here, we report on detecting two anomalies in the specific heat
of Ba$_{\rm 1-x}$K$_{\rm x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ at zero magnetic field. The
anomaly at the higher temperature is accompanied by the appearance of a
spontaneous Nernst effect, indicating broken time-reversal ($Z_2$) symmetry.
The second anomaly at the lower temperature coincides with the transition to a
zero resistance state, indicating superconductivity breaking the $U(1)$ gauge
symmetry. Our data provide calorimetric evidence for the $Z_2$ phase formation
above the superconducting phase transition.

We demonstrate the existence of compactons matter waves in binary mixtures of
Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) trapped in deep optical lattices (OL) subjected
to equal contributions of intra-species Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) under periodic time modulations of the intra-species scattering
length. We show that these modulations lead to the rescaling of the SOC
parameters that involve the density imbalance of the two components. This gives
rise to a density-dependent SOC parameters strongly influence the existence and
stability of compacton matter waves. The stability of SOC-compactons is
investigated both by linear stability analysis and by time integrations of the
coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We find that SOC restricts the parameter
ranges for stable stationary SOC-compacton existence but, on the other side, it
gives a more stringent signature of their occurrence. In particular,
SOC-compactons should appear when the intra-species interactions and the number
of atoms in the two components are perfectly balanced (or close to being
balanced for metastable cases). The possibility to use SOC-compactons as a tool
for indirect measurements of the number of atoms and/or the intra-species
interactions, is also suggested.

Low-molecular weight gelators (LMWG) are small molecules (Mw < ~1 kDa), which
form self-assembled fibrillar networks (SAFiN) hydrogels in water. The great
majority of SAFiN gels is described by an entangled network of self-assembled
fibers, in analogy to a polymer in a good solvent. Here, fibrillation of a
biobased glycolipid bolaamphiphile is triggered by Ca2+ or Ag+ ions, added to
its diluted micellar phase. The resulting SAFiN, which forms hydrogel above 0.5
wt%, has a ``nano-fishnet'' structure, characterized by a fibrous network of
both entangled fibers and $\beta$-sheets-like rafts, generally observed for
silk fibroin, actin hydrogels or mineral imogolite nanotubes, but generally not
known for SAFiN. This work focuses on the strength of the SAFIN gels, their
fast recovery after applying a mechanical stimulus (strain) and their unusual
resistance to temperature, studied by coupling rheology to small angle X-ray
scattering (rheo-SAXS) using synchrotron radiation. The Ca2+-based hydrogel
keeps its properties up to 55{\textdegree}C, while the Ag+-based gel shows a
constant elastic modulus up to 70{\textdegree}C, without appearance of any
gel-to-sol transition temperature. Furthermore, the glycolipid is obtained by
fermentation from natural resources (glucose, rapeseed oil), thus showing that
naturally-engineered compounds can have unprecedented properties, when compared
to the wide range of chemically derived amphiphiles.

The flat band system is an ideal quantum platform to investigate the
kaleidoscope created by the electron-electron correlation effects. The central
ingredient of realizing a flat band is to find its compact localized states. In
this work, we develop a systematic way to generate the compact localized states
by designing destructive interference pattern from 1-dimensional chains. A
variety of 2-dimensional new flat band systems are constructed with this
method. Furthermore, we show that the method can be extended to generate the
compact localized states in multi-orbital systems by carefully designing the
block hopping scheme, as well as in quasicrystal and disorder systems.

<h3>Universal competitive spectral scaling from the critical non-Hermitian  skin effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13536" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13536</a>

Recently, it was discovered that certain non-Hermitian systems can exhibit
qualitative different properties at different system sizes, such as being
gapless at small sizes and having topological edge modes at large sizes $L$.
This dramatic system size sensitivity is known as the critical non-Hermitian
skin effect (cNHSE), and occurs due to the competition between two or more
non-Hermitian pumping channels. In this work, we rigorously develop the notion
of a size-dependent generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) in a general
multi-component cNHSE model ansatz, and found that the GBZ exhibits a universal
$a+b^{1/(L+1)}$ scaling behavior. In particular, we provided analytical
estimates of the scaling rate $b$ in terms of model parameters, and
demonstrated their good empirical fit with two paradigmatic models, the coupled
Hatano-Nelson model with offset, and the topologically coupled chain model with
offset. We also provided analytic result for the critical size $L_c$, below
which cNHSE scaling is frozen. The cNHSE represents the result of juxtaposing
different channels for bulk-boundary correspondence breaking, and can be
readily demonstrated in non-Hermitian metamaterials and circuit arrays.

Identification of important topics in a text can facilitate knowledge
curation, discover thematic trends, and predict future directions. In this
paper, we aim to quantitatively detect the most common research themes in the
emerging supercapacitor research area, and summarize their trends and
characteristics through the proposed unsupervised, machine learning approach.
We have retrieved the complete reference entries of article abstracts from
Scopus database for all original research articles from 2004 to 2021. Abstracts
were processed through a natural language processing pipeline and analyzed by a
latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling algorithm for unsupervised topic
discovery. Nine major topics were further examined through topic-word
associations, Inter-topic distance map and topic-specific word cloud. We
observed the greatest importance is being given to performance metrics (28.2%),
flexible electronics (8%), and graphene-based nanocomposites (10.9%). The
analysis also points out crucial future research directions towards bio-derived
carbon nanomaterials (such as RGO) and flexible supercapacitors.

<h3>Advanced approach of superconducting gap function extraction from  tunneling experiments</h3>

An advanced theoretical framework is introduced and examined. Its main idea
is to extract properties of the superconducting pairing gap function
$\Delta(\omega)$ in the conventional, nearly localized superconductors. To test
the approach, we present an experimentally relevant benchmark model with
defined normal and superconducting sectors. The developed reverse engineering
framework consists of two logic steps. First, dismantle the superconducting
density of states into the effects coming from the superconducting pairing and
effects inherited from the normal state. Second, extract and reconstruct
properties of $\Delta(\omega)$ and compare it to the superconducting sector of
the defined benchmark model. Applying this approach, we can: (i) simulate
extraction from the actual experimental low-temperature tunneling data and
comment on their required properties, and (ii) maintain absolute control above
the reconstructed Cooper-pair-influencing properties during ameliorating the
individual steps of the method.

<h3>Traveling/non-traveling phase transition and non-ergodic properties in  the random transverse-field Ising model on the Cayley tree</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the random transverse field Ising model on a finite Cayley tree.
This enables us to probe key questions arising in other important disordered
quantum systems, in particular the Anderson transition and the problem of dirty
bosons on the Cayley tree, or the emergence of non-ergodic properties in such
systems. We numerically investigate this problem building on the cavity
mean-field method complemented by state-of-the art finite-size scaling
analysis. Our numerics agree very well with analytical results based on an
analogy with the traveling wave problem of a branching random walk in the
presence of an absorbing wall. Critical properties and finite-size corrections
for the zero-temperature paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition are studied both
for constant and algebraically vanishing boundary conditions. In the later
case, we reveal a regime which is reminiscent of the non-ergodic delocalized
phase observed in other systems, thus shedding some light on critical issues in
the context of disordered quantum systems, such as Anderson transitions, the
many-body localization or disordered bosons in infinite dimensions.

<br>
<br>
The datasets presented in this article are related to materials research on
hard ferromagnet in TM-Fe-Si (TM=Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, and Ta) ternary systems.
The motivation for data collection is based on the research paper entitled
"Novel hard magnetic phase with Zr$_{11.5}$Fe$_{53}$Si$_{35.5}$ composition".
The datasets are composed of scanning electron microscope images, X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns, and magnetization data for
TM$_{7}$Fe$_{52}$Si$_{41}$ annealed at 1050 $^{\circ}$C. The chemical
compositions of constituent phases were determined by an energy dispersive
X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The phase analysis was performed using XRD and EDS
results. The Curie temperature of each sample was obtained using magnetization
data, and the coercive field was determined for hard ferromagnet samples
Zr$_{7}$Fe$_{52}$Si$_{41}$ and Hf$_{7}$Fe$_{52}$Si$_{41}$. The datasets would
be useful for developing an Fe-based rare-earth-free permanent magnet, which is
one of the central issues of materials science.

<h3>Tuning quantum paramagnetism and d-wave superconductivity in  single-layer iron chalcogenides by chemical pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
By substituting S into single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3, chemical pressure is applied
to tune its paramagnetic state that is modeled as an incoherent superposition
of spin-spiral states. The resulting electronic bands resemble an ordered
checkerboard antiferromagnetic structure, consistent with angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy
reveals a gap evolving from U-shaped for FeSe to V-shaped for FeS with
decreasing size, attributed to a d-wave superconducting state for which nodes
emerge once the gap size is smaller than the effective spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Stability mapping of bipartite tight-binding graphs with losses and  gain: ${\cal PT}-$symmetry and beyond</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13642" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13642</a>
<br>
<i>L. A. Moreno-Rodriguez, C. T. Martinez-Martinez, J. A. Mendez-Bermudez, Henri Benisty</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider bipartite tight-binding graphs composed by $N$ nodes split into
two sets of equal size: one set containing nodes with on-site loss, the other
set having nodes with on-site gain. The nodes are connected randomly with
probability $p$. We give a rationale for the relevance of such "throttle/brake"
coupled systems (physically open systems) to grasp the stability issues of
complex networks in areas such as biochemistry, neurons or economy, for which
their modelling in terms of non-hermitian Hamiltonians is still in infancy.
Specifically, we measure the connectivity between the two sets with the
parameter $\alpha$, which is the ratio of current adjacent pairs over the total
number of possible adjacent pairs between the sets. For general
undirected-graph setups, the non-hermitian Hamiltonian $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ of
this model presents pseudo-Hermiticity, where $\gamma$ is the loss/gain
strength. However, we show that for a given graph setup $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$
becomes ${\cal PT}-$symmetric. In both scenarios (pseudo-Hermiticity and ${\cal
PT}-$symmetric), depending on the parameter combination, the spectra of
$H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ can be real even when it is non-hermitian. Thus, we
numerically characterize the average fractions of real and imaginary
eigenvalues of $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ as a function of the parameter set
$\{\gamma,\alpha,N\}$. We demonstrate, for both setups, that there is a well
defined sector of the $\gamma\alpha-$plane (which grows with $N$) where the
spectrum of $H(\gamma,\alpha,N)$ is predominantly real.

<h3>Review: Simulational Tests of the Rouse Model</h3>

The file is a Chapter from my review volume "Polymer Physics: Phenomenology
of Polymeric Fluid Simulations". The chapter treats literature tests of the
Rouse model, which is widely invoked as a description of polymer motion in
melts. In summary: The literature conclusively demonstrates that the Rouse
model does not describe polymer motion in melts. Simulations find that the
temporal autocorrelation function of a single Rouse amplitude is a stretched
exponential in time, not the pure exponential predicted by the Rouse model.
Also, the mean-square amplitude of the Rouse modes <(X_p (0) X_p (0) > deviates
from the model's prediction, at least for p > 3. Furthermore, the relaxation
time of <(X_p (0) X_p (t) > depends on p, but not as predicted by the Rouse
model. According to the Rouse model, bead displacements are driven by
independent Gaussian random processes. Accordingly, the intermediate structure
factor g(q,t) is predicted to be accurately described by the Gaussian
approximation. Doob's theorem then guarantees that g(q,t) decays as a single
exponential in time. Simulations show that these predictions of the Rouse model
are incorrect.

<h3>HubbardNet: Efficient Predictions of the Bose-Hubbard Model Spectrum  with Deep Neural Networks</h3>

<i>Ziyan Zhu, Marios Mattheakis, Weiwei Pan, Efthimios Kaxiras</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a deep neural network (DNN)-based model (HubbardNet) to
variationally find the ground state and excited state wavefunctions of the
one-dimensional and two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using this model for a
square lattice with $M$ sites, we obtain the energy spectrum as an analytical
function of the on-site Coulomb repulsion, $U$, and the total number of
particles, $N$, from a single training. This approach bypasses the need to
solve a new hamiltonian for each different set of values $(U,N)$. We show that
the DNN-parametrized solutions are in excellent agreement with results from the
exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian, and it outperforms the exact
diagonalization solution in terms of computational scaling. These advantages
suggest that our model is promising for efficient and accurate computation of
exact phase diagrams of many-body lattice hamiltonians.

<h3>Atomically Sharp Internal Interface in a Chiral Weyl Semimetal Nanowire</h3>

<br>
<br>
Internal interfaces in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are predicted to host distinct
topological features that are different from the commonly studied external
interfaces (crystal-to-vacuum boundaries). However, the lack of atomically
sharp and crystallographically oriented internal interfaces in WSMs makes it
difficult to experimentally investigate hidden topological states buried inside
the material. Here, we study a unique internal interface known as merohedral
twin boundary in chemically synthesized single-crystal nanowires (NWs) of CoSi,
a chiral WSM of space group P213 (No. 198). High resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy reveals that this internal interface is (001)
twin plane and connects two enantiomeric counterparts at an atomically sharp
interface with inversion twinning. Ab-initio calculations show localized
internal Fermi arcs at the (001) twin boundary that can be clearly
distinguished from both external Fermi arcs and bulk states. These merohedrally
twinned CoSi NWs provide an ideal material system to probe unexplored
topological properties associated with internal interfaces in WSMs.

<h3>Fluctuation-driven excess noise near superconducting phase transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13692" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13692</a>
<br>
<i>Juhun Kwak, Emil Pellett, Elio J. König, Alex Levchenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We discuss intrinsic mechanisms of nonequilibrium excess noise in
superconducting devices and transition edge sensors. In particular, we present
an overview of fluctuation-driven contributions to the current noise in the
vicinity of the superconducting transition. We argue that sufficiently close to
the critical temperature fluctuations of conductivity may become correlated
provided that the rate of quasiparticle relaxation is slow as compared to
dynamics of superconducting fluctuations. In this regime, fluctuations of
conductivity adiabatically follow the fluctuations of the electron
distribution. This leads to a substantial enhancement of current noise. The
corresponding spectral power density of noise has a Lorentzian shape in the
frequency domain while its magnitude scales proportionally to the inelastic
relaxation time. It also sensitively depends on the dephasing and
Ginzburg-Landau timescales. Further estimates suggest that this mechanism
dominates over the conventional temperature fluctuations in the same range of
parameters. To describe these effects microscopically, we use the
nonequilibrium Keldysh technique in the semiclassical approximation of
superconductivity with Boltzmann-Langevin random forces to account for
correlations of fluctuations.

<h3>Subsurface Characteristics of Metal-Halide Perovskites Polished by Argon  Ion Beam</h3>

<br>
<br>
Focused ion beam (FIB) techniques have been frequently used to section
metal-halide perovskites for microstructural investigations. However, the ion
beams directly irradiated to the sample surface may alter the properties far
different from pristine, potentially leading to modified deterioration
mechanisms under aging stressors. Here, we combine complementary approaches to
measure the subsurface characteristics of polished perovskite and identify the
chemical species responsible for the measured properties. Analysis of the
experimental results in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations indicates that
atomic displacements and local heating occur in the subsurface of
methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) by glazing Ar+ beam irradiation (15 nm by 4
kV at 3 degree). The lead-rich, iodine-deficient surface promotes rapid phase
segregation under thermal aging conditions. On the other hand, despite the
subsurface modification, our experiments confirm the rest of the MAPbI3 bulk
retains the material integrity. Our observation supports that polished
perovskites could serve in studying the properties of bulk or buried junctions
far away from the altered subsurface with care.

<h3>Linear optical response from the odd parity Bardasis-Schrieffer mode in  locally non-centrosymmetric superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
On the recent report of a magnetic field induced first order transition
between an even-parity superconductivity and an odd-parity superconductivity in
$\mathrm{CeRh_{2}As_{2}}$, the microscopic physics is still under
investigation. However, if, in the vicinity of this transition, the coupling
strengths of the even and odd pairing channels are comparable, a
particle-particle excitonic collective mode referred to as the
Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode should generically exist below the pair-breaking
continuum. This BS mode can couple to the light and thus affect the optical
response of the superconductor, as it arises from a pairing channel with the
parity opposite to that of the ground state pairs. Here, by using a generic
bilayer model Hamiltonian for the electronic degree of freedom, which is
globally centrosymmetric despite each layer being locally non-centrosymmetric,
we study the change of the excitation gap of the BS mode with respect to the
out-of-plane magnetic fields and demonstrate that its coupling to the light is
possible even in the linear response regime. The linear coupling is attributed
to the presence of multiple electronic bands, which is a generic feature of a
bilayer system. Our result shows the microwave absorption as the signature of
the BS mode, and hence a smoking gun signature of the parity-switching at the
transition between two superconducting phases.

<h3>Solving local constraint conditions in slave particle theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13734" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13734</a>
<br>
<i>Xi Luo, Jianqiao Liu, Yue Yu</i>
<br>
<br>
We solve the long-standing difficult problem of the local constraint
conditions, the single occupation of a slave particle per site, in the slave
particle theory. In previous literature, a Lagrange multiplier field
$\lambda_i(t)$ was taken into account to ensure the constraints. This
introduces time-dependent redundant gauge degrees of freedom because original
Lagrange multiplier $\lambda_i$ is static and never becomes time-dependent.
Therefore, an additional (gauge fixing) constraint $\partial_t \lambda_i(t)=0$
which was missed before has to be enforced. This constraint endows
$\lambda_i(t)$ with a dynamics. With this, the slave particle theory dualizes
strongly correlated problems to well-controlled weak coupling problems. The
mean field (MF) approximations are controllable and can be examined if the MF
phases are stable against the $\lambda_i$ fluctuation, e.g., the
superconducting (SC) state of Hubbard model at half-filling is not stable.
While the MF SC state of the $t$-$J$ model is stable, the pairing gap may be
substantially suppressed by the fluctuation. This may explain the SC $T_c$ of
the cuprates is much lower than the MF estimation of $t$-$J$ model.

The complex energy bands of non-Hermitian systems braid in momentum space
even in one dimension. Here, we reveal that the non-Hermitian braiding
underlies the Hermitian topological physics with chiral symmetry under a
general framework that unifies Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems.
Particularly, we derive an elegant identity that equates the linking number
between the knots of braiding non-Hermitian bands and the zero-energy loop to
the topological invariant of chiral-symmetric topological phases in one
dimension. Moreover, we find an exotic class of phase transitions arising from
the critical point transforming different knot structures of the non-Hermitian
braiding, which are not included in the conventional Hermitian topological
phase transition theory. Nevertheless, we show the bulk-boundary correspondence
between the bulk non-Hermitian braiding and boundary zero-modes of the
Hermitian topological insulators. Finally, we construct typical topological
phases with non-Hermitian braidings, which can be readily realized by
artificial crystals.

<br>
<br>
The migration motion of defects in metal halide perovskites quantum dots
(MHPQDs) results in charge-carrier trapping become more complicated. We study
two-step trapping mediated by mobile defects between the ground state of MHPQDs
and a fixed-depth defect using a full-configuration defect method, where all
possible trapping processes mediated by these mobile defects could be
reproduced and the fastest channels among them are picked out. We find that
these two-step trapping processes could keep more one order of magnitude faster
than these direct ones as mobile defect with the appropriate localization
strength, which implies that these indirect trapping should play the crucial
rule to determine the non-radiative recombination losses. These results provide
the significant explanation for studying non-radiation processes of carriers in
the presence of the migration defects in recent experiments. Moreover, this
model will be available to analyze some key performance related defects in
electronic devices.

We here report experimental discovery of tantalum polyhydride superconductor.
It was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions using
diamond anvil cell combined with in-situ high pressure laser heating
techniques. The superconductivity was investigated via resistance measurements
at pressures. The highest superconducting transition temperature Tc was found
to be ~30 K at 197 GPa in the sample that was synthesized at the same pressure
with ~2000 K heating. The transitions are shifted to low temperature upon
applying magnetic fields that supports the superconductivity nature. It is the
first experimental realization of superconducting hydrides for the VB group of
transitional metals. The upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) of the
superconducting phase is estimated to be ~20 T that corresponds to GL coherent
length ~40 angstrom. Our results suggest that the superconductivity arises from
I-43d phase of TaH3, indicating the feasibility to access superconductivity in
transition metal hydrides with low hydrogen content.

The geometrical structure and photoexcitation properties of Zn27-nCdnO27C42
complexes are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) and
time-dependent DFT calculations at the PBE0/6-31G*/SDD level of theory. The
cohesive energy and frequency analysis indicate that the hybrid materials are
energetically stable. In presence of Cd substituting atoms, energy gap of the
ZnO nanodots surrounded by carbon moiety is shown to decrease, as compared to
Cd-free complex. In-depth excited state analysis including charge density
difference (CDD) mapping and absorption spectrum decomposition is performed to
reveal the nature of the dominant excited states and to comprehend the Cd-to-Zn
substitution effect on the photoexcitation properties of Zn27-nCdnO27C42. A
principal possibility to enhance intramolecular charge transfer through
incorporation of certain number of Cd atoms into the ZnO nanodots is shown.
Such Cd-induced modifications in optical properties of semi-spherical
Zn27-nCdnO27C42 complexes could potentially enable use of this hybrid material
in optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

Although the non-Bloch band theory is a milestone in elaborating bulk energy
bands of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary condition (OBC), vital
issues related to multivalued functions of non-Hermitian energy bands remain
unsolved. In this paper, we anatomize the bulk properties of one-dimensional
(1D) multiband non-Hermitian systems under OBC. We put forward the energy-band
branches (EBBs) to settle the multivalued functions of non-Hermitian energy
bands, which become gapped or gapless corresponding to disconnected or
connected EBBs in the complex energy plane, where the branch points and branch
cuts play a crucial role. We clarify the precise significance of the
non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which illustrates the asymptotic behavior of
EBB-eigenstates (bulk eigenstates) in the deep bulk and compensates previous
non-Bloch band theory. We also obtain a general expression of open-boundary
Green's functions based on such EBBs and generalized Brillouin zones (GBZs),
useful for studies on non-Hermitian dynamical evolution.

Recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates $R$NiO$_2$
($R$=Nd, La, Pr) attracts increasing attention as a similar system to cuprates.
Both $R$NiO$_2$ and YBCO cuprates display the three-dimensional (3D) CDW with
wave vector ${\bf q}\sim(2\pi/3,0,q_z)$, while $q_z$ is non-zero and
incommensurate in the former system. Here, we reveal that the characteristic
CDW in $R$NiO$_2$ is naturally explained as the quantum interference between
paramagnons, by focusing on the following characteristics of $R$NiO$_2$: (i)
prominent three-dimensionality in the Fermi surface and (ii) large
self-hole-doping ($\sim 14$%). This mechanism predicts the emergence of the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave bond order at a secondary 3D nesting vector ${\bf
q}^c\sim(2\pi/3,0,q^c_z)$ $(q^c_z=0.2\pi\sim0.6\pi)$. Based on the
paramagnon-interference mechanism, we discuss the CDW orders in nickelates and
cuprates on the same footing.

Thermalization and its breakdown in isolated systems has led to a deeper
understanding of non-equilibrium quantum states and their dependence on initial
conditions. This is prominently highlighted by the existence of quantum scars,
special athermal states with an underlying effective superspin structure,
embedded in an otherwise chaotic many-body spectrum. Spin $XXZ$ models and
their variants in one and higher dimension have been shown to host exact
quantum scars, exhibiting perfect revivals of spin helix states that are
realizable in synthetic and condensed matter systems. Motivated by these
advances, we propose experimentally accessible local, time-dependent protocols
to explore the spatial thermalization profile and highlight how different parts
of the system thermalize and affect the fate of the superspin. We identify
distinct parametric regimes for the ferromagnetic ($X$-polarized) initial state
based on the interplay between the driven spin and the rest, including local
athermal behavior where the driven spin effectively decouples, acting like a
"cold" spot while being instrumental in heating up the other spins. We develop
a real and Floquet space picture that explains our numerical observations, and
make predictions that can be tested in various experimental setups.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) operating in the frequency modulation mode with
a metal tip functionalized with a CO molecule images the internal structure of
molecules with an unprecedented resolution. The interpretation of these images
is often difficult, making the support of theoretical simulations important.
Current simulation methods, particularly the most accurate ones, require
expertise and resources to perform ab initio calculations for the necessary
inputs (i.e charge density and electrostatic potential of the molecule). Here,
we propose an efficient and simple alternative to simulate these AFM images
based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), that avoids all
force calculations, and uses as the only input a 2D ball--and--stick depiction
of the molecule. We discuss the performance of the model when optimized using
different training subsets. Our CGAN reproduces accurately the intramolecular
contrast observed in the simulated images for quasi--planar molecules, but has
significant limitations for molecules with a significant internal torsion, due
to the strictly 2D character of the input.

Many-body unitary dynamics interspersed with repeated measurements display a
rich phenomenology hallmarked by measurement-induced phase transitions.
Employing feedback-control operations that steer the dynamics toward an
absorbing state, we study the entanglement entropy behavior at the absorbing
state phase transition. For short-range control operations, we observe a
transition between phases with distinct sub-extensive scalings of entanglement
entropy. In contrast, the system undergoes a transition between volume-law and
area-law phases for long-range feedback operations. The fluctuations of
entanglement entropy and of the order parameter of the absorbing state
transition are fully coupled for sufficiently strongly entangling feedback
operations. In that case, entanglement entropy inherits the universal dynamics
of the absorbing state transition. This is, however, not the case for arbitrary
control operations, and the two transitions are generally distinct. We
quantitatively support our results by introducing a framework based on
stabilizer circuits with classical flag labels. Our results shed new light on
the problem of observability of measurement-induced phase transitions.

<h3>Anomalous superconducting proximity effect of planar Pb-RhPb2  heterojunctions in the clean limit</h3>

<br>
Interest in superconducting proximity effect has been revived by the
exploitation of Andreev states and by the possible emergence of Majorana bound
states at the interface. Spectroscopy of these states has been so far
restricted to just a handful of superconductor-metal systems in the diffusion
regime, whereas reports in otherwise clean superconductor-superconductor
heterojunctions are scarce. Here, we realize molecular beam epitaxy growth of
atomically sharp planar heterojunctions between Pb and a topological
superconductor candidate RhPb2 that allows us to spectroscopically image the
proximity effect in the clean limit. The measured energy spectra of RhPb2 vary
with the spatial separation from proximal Pb, and exhibit unusual modifications
in the pairing gap structure and size that extend over a distance far beyond
the coherence length. This anomalously long-range proximity (LRP) effect breaks
the rotational symmetry of Cooper pair potential in real space and largely
deforms the Abrikosov vortex cores. Our work opens promising avenues for
fundamental studies of the Andreev physics and extraordinary states in clean
superconducting heterojunctions.

<h3>Cumulant expansion in the Holstein model: Spectral functions and  mobility</h3>

<br>
<br>
We examine the range of validity of the second-order cumulant expansion (CE)
for the calculation of spectral functions, quasiparticle properties, and
mobility of the Holstein polaron. We devise an efficient numerical
implementation that allows us to make comparisons in a broad interval of
temperature, electron-phonon coupling, and phonon frequency. For a benchmark,
we use the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) which gives, as we have recently
shown, rather accurate spectral functions in the whole parameter space even in
low dimension. We find that in one dimension the CE resolves well both the
quasiparticle and the first satellite peak in a regime of intermediate
coupling. At high temperatures, the charge mobility assumes a power law
$\mu\propto T^{-2}$ in the limit of weak coupling and $\mu\propto T^{-3/2}$ for
stronger coupling. We find that, for stronger coupling, the CE gives slightly
better results than the self-consistent Migdal approximation (SCMA), while the
one-shot Migdal approximation is appropriate only for a very weak
electron-phonon interaction. We also analyze the atomic limit and the spectral
sum rules. We derive an analytical expression for the moments in CE and find
that they are exact up to the fourth order, as opposed to the SCMA where they
are exact to the third order. Finally, we analyze the results in higher
dimensions.

<h3>Examination of saturation coverage of polygons using random sequential  adsorption algorithm</h3>

<br>
<br>
The goal of random sequential adsorption (RSA), a time-dependent packing
method, is to create a regular or asymmetric covering of an empty space that
can fit in the allocated space without overlapping. The density of coverage
tends to reach a limit in the infinite-time limit. We attempt to estimate
saturated packing of oriented 2-D polygons, including squares(4-sides), regular
pentagons (5-sides), regular hexagons (6-sides), regular heptagons (7-sides),
regular octagons (8-sides), regular nonagons (9-sides), regular decagons
(10-sides), and regular dodecagons (12-sides), in this study. We obtained
results that are consistent with previous, extrapolation-based studies1. We
utilised the "separating axis theorem" to determine if there is overlap between
arriving polygons and those that have previously been placed. Saturation as a
lower limit is considered to have been reached when RSA addition becomes
excessively slow, according to us.

Experiments using nanofluidic devices have proven effective in characterizing
the physical properties of polymers confined to small cavities. Two recent
studies using such methods examined the organization and dynamics of two DNA
molecules in box-like cavities with strong confinement in one direction and
with square and elliptical cross sections in the lateral plane. Motivated by
these experiments, we employ Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations to
study the physical behaviour of two polymers confined to small cavities with
shapes comparable to those used in the experiments. We quantify the effects of
varying the following polymer properties and confinement dimensions on the
organization and dynamics of the polymers: the polymer width, the polymer
contour length ratio, the cavity cross-sectional area, and the degree of cavity
elongation for cavities with rectangular and elliptical cross sections. We find
that the tendency for polymers to segregate is enhanced by increasing polymer
width. For sufficiently small cavities, increasing cavity elongation promotes
segregation and localization of identical polymers to opposite sides of the
cavity along its long axis. A free-energy barrier controls the rate of polymers
swapping positions, and the observed dynamics are roughly in accord with
predictions of a simple theoretical model. Increasing the contour length
difference between polymers significantly affects their organization in the
cavity. In the case of a large linear polymer co-trapped with a small ring
polymer in an elliptical cavity, the small polymer tends to lie near the
lateral confining walls, and especially at the cavity poles for highly
elongated ellipses.

The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in helimagnets (CrAs,
MnP) has attracted considerable interest in understanding the relationship
between complex magnetism and unconventional superconductivity. However, the
nature of the magnetism and magnetic interactions that drive the unusual
double-helical magnetic order in these materials remains unclear. Here, we
report neutron scattering measurements of magnetic excitations in CrAs single
crystals at ambient pressure. Our experiments reveal well defined spin wave
excitations up to about 150 meV with a pseudogap below 7 meV, which can be
effectively described by the Heisenberg model with nearest neighbor exchange
interactions. Most surprisingly, the spin excitations are largely quenched
above the Neel temperature, in contrast to cuprates and iron pnictides where
the spectral weight is mostly preserved in the paramagnetic state. Our results
suggest that the helimagnetic order is driven by strongly frustrated exchange
interactions, and that CrAs is at the verge of itinerant and
correlation-induced localized states, which is therefore highly
pressure-tunable and favorable for superconductivity.

<h3>Critical role of electron-phonon interactions in determining the  relative stability of Boron Nitride polymorphs</h3>

Despite several first principles studies, the relative stability of BN
polymorphs remains controversial. The stable polymorph varies between the cubic
(c-BN) and hexagonal (h-BN) depending on the van der Waals (vdW) dispersion
approximation used. These studies are unable to explain the main experimental
results, c-BN is stable, the relative stability order and the large energy
difference between h-BN and c-BN (greater than 150 meV/formula unit). In this
study, we introduce contributions from electron-phonon interactions (EPI) to
the total energy of BN polymorphs. This clearly establishes c-BN is the stable
polymorph irrespective of the vdW approximation. Only by including EPI
contributions do the ab initio results match, for the first time, the main
experimental results mentioned above. The EPI contribution to the total energy
is strongly sensitive to chemical bonding (approximately twice in $sp^2$-bonded
layered over $sp^3$-bonded polymorphs) and to crystal structure. The crucial
role of EPI contributions is seen in $sp^2$-bonded layered BN polymorphs where
it is greater than the vdW contribution. Given that h-BN is a prototype layered
material, in bulk or 2D form, our results have a broader relevance, that is,
including EPI correction, along with vdW approximation, is vital for the study
of energetics in layered materials.

<h3>Intrinsic Orbital and Spin Hall Effect in Bismuth Semimetal</h3>

We investigate the intrinsic orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) and spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) in Bismuth semimetal, by employing sp-orbital tight-binding
model. We report a substantial difference between anisotropy of OHC and SHC
whose orbital and spin polarization lie within the basal plane. We do not
observe substantial correlation between the orbital and spin Berry curvature
with spin orbit coupling (SOC) at Fermi energy, disproving the correlation
between OHC and SHC in strong SOC regime. We argue the huge SHC in Bi semimetal
attributes to its gigantic SOC which strongly affects the hybridization of the
p-orbitals, despite its relatively small magnitude of OHC. We hope the distinct
anisotropy of OHC and SHC provides a feasible mean to differentiate the two
effects in experiments.

A Josephson junction subject to an external RF excitation may experience the
inverse AC Josephson effect, where the phase across the junction locks to the
drive. The resulting ``Shapiro steps'' of quantized voltage are currently
utilized in primary voltage standards. The effect has also been a key technique
in the search for topological superconductivity. Here, we study a particularly
interesting regime in which the zero voltage state becomes unstable at zero DC
bias, and the junction spontaneously develops the first Shapiro step with a
voltage $V=\pm \hbar \omega /2e$. The switching time between the $+ \hbar
\omega /2e$ and $- \hbar \omega /2e$ states ranges from milliseconds to hours.
Most interestingly, we find a surprising regime with a non-monotonic
temperature dependence, in which the switching time demonstrates a pronounced
minimum at intermediate temperatures. Tuning of the measurement parameters is
also shown to give rise to a tristable switching behavior, showcasing the
potential for further experiments in stochastic physics and quantum
thermodynamics.

Anisotropic magnetic exchange interactions lead to a surprisingly rich
variety of the magnetic properties. Considering the spin orbit coupling (SOC)
as perturbation, we extract the general expression of a bilinear spin
Hamiltonian, including isotropic exchange interaction, antisymmetric
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and symmetric $\Gamma $ term. Though it
is commonly believed that the magnitude of the DM and $\Gamma $ interaction
correspond to the first and second order of SOC strength $% \lambda $
respectively, we clarify that the term proportional to $\lambda ^{2}$ also has
contribution to DM interaction. Based on combining magnetic force theorem and
linear-response approach, we have presented the method of calculating
anisotropic magnetic interactions, which now has been implemented in the open
source software WienJ. Furthermore, we introduce another method which could
calculate the first and second order SOC contribution to the DM interaction
separately, and overcome some shortcomings of previous methods. Our methods are
successfully applied to several typical weak ferromagnets for $3d$, $4d$ and
$5d$ transition metal oxides. We also predict the conditions where the DM
interactions proportional to $\lambda $ are symmetrically forbidden while the
DM interactions proportional to $\lambda ^{2}$ are nonzero, and believe that it
is widespread in certain magnetic materials.

In this communication, we study the level-spectra statistics when a
noninteracting electron gas is confined in \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski Carpet}
(\textit{SC}) lattices. These \textit{SC} lattices are constructed under two
representative patterns of the $self$ and $gene$ patterns, and classified into
two subclass lattices by the area-perimeter scaling law. By the singularly
continuous spectra and critical traits using two level-statistic tools\iffalse
the nearest spacing distribution and alternative gap-ratio distribution\fi, we
ascertain that both obey the critical phase due to broken translation symmetry
and the long-range order of scaling symmetry. The Wigner-like conjecture is
confirmed numerically since both belong to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. An
analogy was observed in a quasiperiodic lattice~\cite{Zhong1998Level}. In
addition, this critical phase isolates the crucial behavior near the
metal-insulator transition edge in Anderson model. The lattice topology of the
self-similarity feature can induce level clustering behavior.

We study the effect of driving a two-dimensional honeycomb system out of
equilibrium using an elliptically polarized light as a time-dependent
perturbation. In particular, we try to understand the topological phase diagram
of this driven system when the external drive is a vector potential given by
${\bf A}(t) = (A_{0x} \cos(\Omega t), A_{0y} \cos(\Omega t + \phi_0))$. These
topological phases are characterized by the Floquet Chern number which, in each
of these phases, is related to the number of robust edge modes on a nanoribbon.
We show that varying the ratio $A_{0x}/A_{0y}$ of the external drive is a
possible way to take the system from a trivial to a topological phase and vice
versa.

Geometrical frustration in strongly correlated systems can give rise to a
plethora of novel ordered states and intriguing magnetic phases such as quantum
spin liquids. Promising candidate materials for such phases can be described by
the Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice, a paradigmatic model
capturing the interplay between strong correlations and magnetic frustration.
However, the fate of frustrated magnetism in the presence of itinerant dopants
remains unclear, as well as its connection to the doped phases of the square
Hubbard model. Here, we probe the local spin order of a Hubbard model with
controllable frustration and doping, using ultracold fermions in anisotropic
optical lattices continuously tunable from a square to a triangular geometry.
At half-filling and strong interactions $U/t \sim 9$, we observe at the
single-site level how frustration reduces the range of magnetic correlations
and drives a transition from a collinear N\'eel antiferromagnet to a
short-range correlated 120$^{\circ}$ spiral phase. Away from half-filling,
magnetic correlations show a pronounced asymmetry between particle and hole
doping close to triangular geometries and hint at a transition to ferromagnetic
order at a particle doping above $20\%$. This work paves the way towards
exploring possible chiral ordered or superconducting phases in triangular
lattices, and realizing t-tprime square lattice Hubbard models that may be
essential to describe superconductivity in cuprate materials.

Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we study a system of transversely
propelling filament and passive Brownian particles. We consider a polymer whose
monomers experience a constant propulsion force perpendicular to the local
tangent in the presence of passive particles undergoing thermal fluctuations in
two dimensions. We demonstrate that the sideways propelling polymer can act as
a sweeper to collect the passive Brownian particles, mimicking a shuttle-cargo
system. The number of particles the polymer collects during its motion
increases with time and finally saturates to a maximum number. Moreover, the
velocity of the polymer decreases as the particles get trapped due to the extra
drag they generate. Rather than going to zero, the velocity eventually reaches
a terminal value close to the contribution from the thermal velocity when it
collects the maximum load. We show that, apart from the length of the polymer,
the propulsion strength and the number of passive particles are deciding
factors for the maximum trapped particles. In addition, we demonstrate that the
collected particles arrange themselves in a triangular, closed, packed state,
similar to what has been observed in

We show that a grain boundary (GB) defect, constituted by a one-dimensional
dislocation superlattice, can host a topological superconductor (SC) with a
pair of co-habitating Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at its end when immersed in a
parent two-dimensional topological SC. For the realization of our proposal, it
is essential that the single-dislocation defects feature MZMs, implying that
the parent topological SC should be gapped with the Fermi surface away from the
$\Gamma-$point. As we demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, the GB
topological SC with two localized MZMs then emerge in a finite range of both
the angle and the magnitude of the applied exchange magnetic field. Finally, we
argue that the proposed GB SC can be realized in various superconducting
materials where the GB defects can be readily manipulated.
