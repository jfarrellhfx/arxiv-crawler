<h3>Geometric engineering of viscous magnetotransport in a two-dimensional  electron system</h3>

In this study, we present our experimental investigation on the
magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electron system in GaAs
quantum wells utilizing a variety of device geometries, including obstacles
with thin barriers and periodic width variations. Our primary focus is to
explore the impact of these geometries on the electron viscous flow parameters,
enabling precise manipulation of hydrodynamic effects under controlled
conditions. Through an analysis of the large negative magnetoresistivity and
zero field resistivity, we deduce the scattering times for electron-electron
and electron-phonon interactions, as well as the effective channel width. Our
findings confirm that the system under investigation serves as a tunable
experimental platform for investigating hydrodynamic transport regimes at
temperatures above 10 K.

<h3>Evaluating the diversity and utility of materials proposed by generative  models</h3>

Generative machine learning models can use data generated by scientific
modeling to create large quantities of novel material structures. Here, we
assess how one state-of-the-art generative model, the physics-guided crystal
generation model (PGCGM), can be used as part of the inverse design process. We
show that the default PGCGM's input space is not smooth with respect to
parameter variation, making material optimization difficult and limited. We
also demonstrate that most generated structures are predicted to be
thermodynamically unstable by a separate property-prediction model, partially
due to out-of-domain data challenges. Our findings suggest how generative
models might be improved to enable better inverse design.

Plastic sorting is a very essential step in waste management, especially due
to the presence of multilayer plastics. These monomaterial and multimaterial
plastics are widely employed to enhance the functional properties of packaging,
combining beneficial properties in thickness, mechanical strength, and heat
tolerance. However, materials containing multiple polymer species need to be
pretreated before they can be recycled as monomaterials and therefore should
not end up in monomaterial streams. Industry 4.0 has significantly improved
materials sorting of plastic packaging in speed and accuracy compared to manual
sorting, specifically through Near Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging (NIRHSI) that
provides an automated, fast, and accurate material characterization, without
sample preparation. Identification of multimaterials with HSI however requires
novel dedicated approaches for chemical pattern recognition. Non negative
Matrix Factorization, NMF, is widely used for the chemical resolution of
hyperspectral images. Chemically relevant model constraints may make it
specifically valuable to identify multilayer plastics through HSI.
Specifically, Multi Block Non Negative Matrix Factorization (MBNMF) with
correspondence among different chemical species constraint may be used to
evaluate the presence or absence of particular polymer species. To translate
the MBNMF model into an evidence based sorting decision, we extended the model
with an F test to distinguish between monomaterial and multimaterial objects.
The benefits of our new approach, MBNMF, were illustrated by the identification
of several plastic waste objects.

<h3>Characterization and classification of interacting (2+1)D topological  crystalline insulators with orientation-preserving wallpaper groups</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12389" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12389</a>

<br>
While free fermion topological crystalline insulators have been largely
classified, the analogous problem in the strongly interacting case has been
only partially solved. In this paper, we develop a characterization and
classification of interacting, invertible fermionic topological phases in (2+1)
dimensions with charge conservation, discrete magnetic translation and $M$-fold
point group rotation symmetries, which form the group $G_f = \text{U}(1)^f
\times_{\phi} [\mathbb{Z}^2\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_M]$ for $M=1,2,3,4,6$. $\phi$ is
the magnetic flux per unit cell. We derive a topological response theory in
terms of background crystalline gauge fields, which gives a complete
classification of different phases and a physical characterization in terms of
quantized response to symmetry defects. We then derive the same classification
in terms of a set of real space invariants $\{\Theta_{\text{o}}^\pm\}$ that can
be obtained from ground state expectation values of suitable partial rotation
operators. We explicitly relate these real space invariants to the quantized
coefficients in the topological response theory, and find the dependence of the
invariants on the chiral central charge $c_-$ of the invertible phase. Finally,
when $\phi = 0$ we derive an explicit map between the free and interacting
classifications.

<h3>Entanglement phases, localization and multifractality of monitored free  fermions in two dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12391" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12391</a>
<br>
<i>K. Chahine, M. Buchhold</i>
<br>
<br>
We explore the entanglement structure and wave function properties of
continuously monitored free fermions with $U(1)$-symmetry in two spatial
dimensions (2D). Deriving the fermion replica-Keldysh field theory, and a
bosonic effective long-wavelength action, we discuss similarities and
differences between entanglement phase transitions of monitored fermions in two
dimensions and Anderson-type localization transitions in three dimensions. We
then establish the phenomenology of entanglement transitions of monitored
fermions in 2D by extracting the entanglement entropy, mutual information, and
wave function inverse participation ratio from exact numerical simulations. At
weak monitoring, a characteristic $L\log L$ entanglement growth and a
multifractal dimension $D_q=2$ are reminiscent of a metallic Fermi liquid. For
strong monitoring, exponentially localized wave functions yield a saturation
towards area law entanglement. In between, the critical point displays both an
entanglement scaling consistent with an emergent conformal invariance and
strong multifractality. The numerical results are in good agreement with a
mean-field analysis and a one-loop renormalization group treatment of the field
theory. This shapes the picture of a monitoring induced metal-to-insulator
transition in the entanglement content and establishes 2D monitored fermions as
a novel arena to explore the link between non-unitary quantum dynamics in $D$
dimensions and quantum statistical mechanics in $D+1$ dimensions.

<h3>A Rydberg platform for non-ergodic chiral quantum dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12392</a>
<br>
<i>Riccardo J. Valencia-Tortora, Nicola Pancotti, Michael Fleischhauer, Hannes Bernien, Jamir Marino</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a mechanism for engineering chiral interactions in Rydberg atoms
via a directional antiblockade condition, where an atom can change its state
only if an atom to its right (or left) is excited. The scalability of our
scheme enables us to explore the many-body dynamics of kinetically constrained
models with unidirectional character. We observe non-ergodic behavior via
either scars, confinement, or localization, upon simply tuning the strength of
two driving fields acting on the atoms. We discuss how our mechanism persists
in the presence of classical noise and how the degree of chirality in the
interactions can be tuned, providing paths for investigating a wide range of
models.

<h3>Twenty-five years of random asset exchange modeling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12418</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The last twenty-five years have seen the development of a significant
literature within the subfield of econophysics which attempts to model economic
inequality as an emergent property of stochastic interactions among ensembles
of agents. In this article, the literature surrounding this approach to the
study of wealth and income distributions, henceforth the "random asset
exchange" literature following the terminology of Sinha (2003), is thoroughly
reviewed for the first time. The foundational papers of Dragulescu and
Yakovenko (2000), Chakraborti and Chakrabarti (2000), and Bouchaud and Mezard
(2000) are discussed in detail, and principal canonical models within the
random asset exchange literature are established. The most common variations
upon these canonical models are enumerated, and significant papers within each
kind of modification are introduced. The successes of such models, as well as
the limitations of their underlying assumptions, are discussed, and it is
argued that the literature should move in the direction of more explicit
representations of economic structure and processes to acquire greater
explanatory power.

<h3>The influence of film thickness and uniaxial anisotropy on in-plane  skyrmions: Numerical investigations of the phase space of chiral magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12419" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12419</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The equilibrium phase space of magnetic textures in thin-films of cubic
chiral ferromagnets, including skyrmions, is explored as a function of in-plane
magnetic field strength, film thickness and uniaxial anisotropy. The interplay
between these system parameters is found to give rise to a phase space with a
rich structure, distinct from that of the nano-stripes that have been
previously studied. For certain values of the anisotropy, the range of
thicknesses supporting in-plane skyrmions and/or helicoids with an out-of-plane
propagation vector is found to be disconnected, suggesting a possible direction
for future experiments. We explain how this interesting phase space topology
arises due to the geometric confinement of the thin-film system, and identify
the optimal parameter ranges for future explorations of novel magnetic textures
such as the oblique spiral phase.

<h3>Quasimolecular $J_{\rm tet}$=3/2 moments in the cluster Mott insulator  GaTa$_4$Se$_8$</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Magnaterra, J. Attig, L. Peterlini, M. Hermanns, M. H. Upton, Jungho Kim, L. Prodan, V. Tsurkan, I. Kézsmárki, P.H.M. van Loosdrecht, M. Grüninger</i>
<br>
<br>
Quasimolecular orbitals in cluster Mott insulators provide a route to tailor
exchange interactions, which may yield novel quantum phases of matter. We
demonstrate the cluster Mott character of the lacunar spinel GaTa$_4$Se$_8$
using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ta $L_3$ edge.
Electrons are fully delocalized over Ta$_4$ tetrahedra, forming quasimolecular
$J_{\rm tet}$=3/2 moments. The modulation of the RIXS intensity as function of
the transferred momentum q allows us to determine the cluster wavefunction,
which depends on competing intracluster hopping terms that mix states with
different character. This mixed wavefunction is decisive for the macroscopic
properties since it affects intercluster hopping and exchange interactions and
furthermore renormalizes the effective spin-orbit coupling constant. The
versatile wavefunction, tunable via intracluster hopping, opens a new
perspective on the large family of lacunar spinels and cluster Mott insulators
in general.

<h3>Critical Field Anisotropy and Muon Spin Relaxation Study of  Superconducting Dirac-Semimetal CaSb$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12457" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12457</a>

<i>M. Oudah, Y. Cai, M. V. De Toro Sanchez, J. Bannies, M. C. Aronson, K. M. Kojima, D. A. Bonn</i>
<br>
<br>
CaSb$_2$ has been identified as a bulk superconductor and a topological
semimetal, which makes it a great platform for realizing topological
superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the superconducting upper and
lower critical field anisotropy using magnetic susceptibility, and study the
superconducting state using muon spin-relaxation. The temperature dependence of
transverse-field relaxation can be fitted with a single-gap model or two-gap
model, consistent with previous tunnel-diode oscillator measurements. We
highlight that the normal state of CaSb$_2$ shows a large diamagnetic signal,
which is likely related to its Dirac semimetal nature. Zero-field relaxation
shows little temperature dependence when the muon-spin is parallel to the
$c*$-axis, while an increase in relaxation appears below 1~K when the muon-spin
is parallel to the $ab$-plane. This may be related to a second superconducting
phase appearing at low temperature below the bulk $T_c$ . However, we find no
discernible anomaly in $\mu_{\rm{0}} H_{\rm{c1}}(0)$ around this temperature as
has been seen in other superconductors with secondary superconducting states
that appear at lower temperatures.

<h3>Bayesian optimisation approach to quantify the effect of input parameter  uncertainty on predictions of numerical physics simulations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12464" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12464</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
An understanding of how input parameter uncertainty in the numerical
simulation of physical models leads to simulation output uncertainty is a
challenging task. Common methods for quantifying output uncertainty, such as
performing a grid or random search over the model input space, are
computationally intractable for a large number of input parameters, represented
by a high-dimensional input space. It is therefore generally unclear as to
whether a numerical simulation can reproduce a particular outcome (e.g. a set
of experimental results) with a plausible set of model input parameters. Here,
we present a method for efficiently searching the input space using Bayesian
Optimisation to minimise the difference between the simulation output and a set
of experimental results. Our method allows explicit evaluation of the
probability that the simulation can reproduce the measured experimental results
in the region of input space defined by the uncertainty in each input
parameter. We apply this method to the simulation of charge-carrier dynamics in
the perovskite semiconductor methyl-ammonium lead iodide MAPbI$_3$ that has
attracted attention as a light harvesting material in solar cells. From our
analysis we conclude that the formation of large polarons, quasiparticles
created by the coupling of excess electrons or holes with ionic vibrations,
cannot explain the experimentally observed temperature dependence of electron
mobility.

<h3>Spin Weyl Topological Insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
The quantum nature of electron spin is crucial for establishing topological
invariants in real materials. Since the spin does not in general commute with
the Hamiltonian, some of the topological features of the material can be
extracted from its study. In insulating materials, the spin operator induces a
projected operator on valence states called the spin valence operator. Its
spectrum contains information with regard to the different phases of the spin
Chern class. If the spin valence spectrum is gapped, the spin Chern numbers are
constant along parallel planes thus defining spin Chern insulating materials.
If the spin valence spectrum is not gapped, the changes in the spin Chern
numbers occur whenever this spectrum is zero. Materials whose spin valence
spectrum are gapless will be denoted spin Weyl topological insulators and its
definition together with some of their properties will be presented in this
work. The classification of materials from the properties of the spin valence
operator provides a new characterization which complements the existing list of
topological invariants.

<br>
<br>
We study Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) nanoflakes that we produce via mechanical cleaving
and exfoliation of YIG single crystals. By characterizing their structural and
magnetic properties, we find that these YIG nanoflakes have surfaces oriented
along unusual crystallographic axes and uniaxial in-plane magnetic anisotropy
due to their shape, both of which are not commonly available in YIG thin films.
These physical properties, combined with the possibility of picking up the YIG
nanoflakes and stacking them onto nanoflakes of other van der Waals materials
or pre-patterned electrodes or waveguides, open unexplored possibilities for
magnonics and for the realization of novel YIG-based heterostructures and
devices.

<h3>Post deposition interfacial Néel temperature tuning in magnetoelectric  B:Cr2O3</h3>

Boron (B) alloying transforms the magnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr2O3 into
a multifunctional single-phase material which enables electric field driven
{\pi}/2 rotation of the N\'eel vector. Nonvolatile, voltage-controlled N\'eel
vector rotation is a much-desired material property in the context of
antiferromagnetic spintronics enabling ultra-low power, ultra-fast, nonvolatile
memory, and logic device applications. N\'eel vector rotation is detected with
the help of heavy metal (Pt) Hall-bars in proximity of pulsed laser deposited
B:Cr2O3 films. To facilitate operation of B:Cr2O3-based devices in CMOS
environments, the N\'eel temperature, TN, of the functional film must be
tunable to values significantly above room temperature. Cold neutron depth
profiling and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy depth profiling reveal thermally
activated B-accumulation at the B:Cr2O3/ vacuum interface in thin films
deposited on Al2O3 substrates. We attribute the B-enrichment to surface
segregation. Magnetotransport data confirm B-accumulation at the interface
within a layer of about 50 nm thick where the device properties reside. Here TN
enhances from 334 K prior to annealing, to 477 K after annealing for several
hours. Scaling analysis determines TN as a function of the annealing
temperature. Stability of post-annealing device properties is evident from
reproducible N\'eel vector rotation at 370 K performed over the course of
weeks.

<h3>Ferromagnetic quantum critical point in a locally noncentrosymmetric and  nonsymmorphic Kondo metal</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum critical points (QCPs), zero-temperature phase transitions, are
windows to fundamental quantum-mechanical phenomena associated with universal
behaviour and can provide parallels to the physics of black holes. Magnetic
QCPs have been extensively investigated in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic
order. However, QCPs are rare in metallic ferromagnets due to the coupling of
the order parameter to electronic soft modes [1,2]. Recently, antisymmetric
spin-orbit coupling in noncentrosymmetric systems was suggested to protect
ferromagnetic QCPs [3]. Nonetheless, multiple centrosymmetric materials host FM
QCPs, suggesting a more general mechanism behind their protection. In this
context, CeSi$_{2-\delta}$, a dense Kondo lattice crystallising in a
centrosymmetric structure, exhibits ferromagnetic order when Si is replaced
with Ag. We report that the Ag-substitution controls the strength of the Kondo
coupling, leading to a transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic Kondo
phases. Remarkably, a ferromagnetic QCP accompanied by concurrent strange-metal
behaviour emerges. Herein, we suggest that, despite the centrosymmetric
structure, spin-orbit coupling arising from the local noncentrosymmetric
structure, in combination with nonsymmorphic symmetry, can protect
ferromagnetic QCPs. Our findings present a unique example of Kondo
coupling-driven ferromagnetic QCP through chemical doping and offer a general
guideline for discovering new ferromagnetic QCPs.

<h3>Theory of robust quantum many-body scars in long-range interacting  systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional energy eigenstates of quantum
many-body systems associated with violations of thermalization for special
non-equilibrium initial states. Their various systematic constructions require
fine-tuning of local Hamiltonian parameters. In this work we demonstrate that
the setting of long-range interacting quantum spin systems generically hosts
robust QMBS. We analyze spectral properties upon raising the power-law decay
exponent $\alpha$ of spin-spin interactions from the solvable
permutationally-symmetric limit $\alpha=0$. First, we numerically establish
that despite spectral signatures of chaos appear for infinitesimal $\alpha$,
the towers of $\alpha=0$ energy eigenstates with large collective spin are
smoothly deformed as $\alpha$ is increased, and exhibit characteristic QMBS
features. To elucidate the nature and fate of these states in larger systems,
we introduce an analytical approach based on mapping the spin Hamiltonian onto
a relativistic quantum rotor non-linearly coupled to an extensive set of
bosonic modes. We exactly solve for the eigenstates of this interacting
impurity model, and show their self-consistent localization in large-spin
sectors of the original Hamiltonian for $0<\alpha<d$. Our theory unveils the
stability mechanism of such QMBS for arbitrary system size and predicts
instances of its breakdown e.g. near dynamical critical points or in presence
of semiclassical chaos, which we verify numerically in long-range quantum Ising
chains. As a byproduct, we find a predictive criterion for presence or absence
of heating under periodic driving for $0<\alpha<d$, beyond existing
Floquet-prethermalization theorems. Broader perspectives of this work range
from independent applications of the technical toolbox developed here to
informing experimental routes to metrologically useful multipartite
entanglement.

The Matsubara Green's function formalism stands as a powerful technique for
computing the thermodynamic characteristics of interacting quantum
many-particle systems at finite temperatures. In this manuscript, our focus
centers on introducing MatsubaraFunctions.jl, a Julia library that implements
data structures for generalized n-point Green's functions on Matsubara
frequency grids. The package's architecture prioritizes user-friendliness
without compromising the development of efficient solvers for quantum field
theories in equilibrium. Following a comprehensive introduction of the
fundamental types, we delve into a thorough examination of key facets of the
interface. This encompasses avenues for accessing Green's functions, techniques
for extrapolation and interpolation, as well as the incorporation of symmetries
and a variety of parallelization strategies. Examples of increasing complexity
serve to demonstrate the practical utility of the library, supplemented by
discussions on strategies for sidestepping impediments to optimal performance.

<h3>Experimental and theoretical assessment of native oxide in the  superconducting TaN</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this manuscript, we show through an experimental-computational proof of
concept the native oxide formation into superconducting TaN films. First, TaN
was synthesized at an ultra-high vacuum system by reactive pulsed laser
deposition and characterized in situ by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The
material was also characterized ex situ by X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, and the four-point probe method. It was detected that TaN
contained considerable oxygen impurities (up to 26 %O) even though it was grown
in an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Furthermore, the impurified TaN evidence a
face-centered cubic crystalline structure only and exhibits superconductivity
at 2.99 K. To understand the feasibility of the native oxide in TaN, we study
the effect of incorporating different amounts of O atoms in TaN using ab-initio
calculations. A thermodynamic stability analysis shows that a TaOxN1-x model
increases its stability as oxygen is added, demonstrating that oxygen may
always be present in TaN, even when obtained at ultra-high vacuum conditions.
All analyzed models exhibit metallic behavior. Charge density difference maps
reveal that N and O atoms have a higher charge density redistribution than Ta
atoms. The electron localization function maps and line profiles indicate that
Ta-O and Ta-N bonds are mainly ionic. As expected, stronger ionic behavior is
observed in the Ta-O bonds due to the electronegativity difference between O
and N atoms. Recent evidence points to superconductivity in bulk TaO,
confirming the asseverations of superconductivity in our samples. The results
discussed here highlight the importance of considering native oxide when
reporting superconductivity in TaN films since the TaO regions formed in the
compound may be key to understanding the different critical temperatures
reported in the literature.

<h3>Superconductivity in Compositionally-Complex Cuprates with the  YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ Structure</h3>

<br>
High-temperature superconductivity is reported in a series of
compositionally-complex cuprates with varying degrees of size and spin
disorder. Three compositions of Y-site alloyed YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, i.e.,
(5Y)BCO, were prepared using solid-state methods with different sets of rare
earth ions on the Y-site. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy confirm these samples have high phase-purity and homogeneous
mixing of the Y-site elements. The superconducting phase transition was probed
using electrical resistivity and AC magnetometry measurements, which reveal the
transition temperature, T$_C$, is greater than 91 K for all series when near
optimal oxygen doping. Importantly, these T$_C$ values are only $\approx$1$\%$
suppressed relative to pure YBCO (T$_C$ = 93 K). This result highlights the
robustness of pairing in the YBCO structure to specific types of disorder. In
addition, the chemical flexibility of compositionally-complex cuprates allows
spin and lattice disorder to be decoupled to a degree not previously possible
in high-temperature superconductors. This feature makes compositionally-complex
cuprates a uniquely well-suited materials platform for studying proposed
pairing interactions in cuprates.

<i>Derek Frydel</i>
<br>
<br>
When it comes to active particles, even an ideal-gas model in a harmonic
potential poses a mathematical challenge. An exception is a run-and-tumble
model (RTP) in one-dimension for which a stationary distribution is known
exactly. The case of two-dimensions is more complex but the solution is
possible. Incidentally, in both dimensions the stationary distributions
correspond to a beta function. In three-dimensions, a stationary distribution
is not known but simulations indicate that it does not have a beta function
form. The current work focuses on the three-dimensional RTP model in a harmonic
trap. The main result of this study is the derivation of the recurrence
relation for generating moments of a stationary distribution. These moments are
then used to recover a stationary distribution using the Fourier-Lagrange
expansion.

We study the optical conductivity of a pristine two-dimensional electron
system near an Ising-nematic quantum critical point. We discuss the the
relation between the frequency scaling of the conductivity and the shape of the
Fermi surface, namely, whether it is isotropic, convex or concave. We confirm
the cancellation of the leading order terms in the optical conductivity for the
cases of isotropic and convex Fermi surfaces and show that the remaining
contribution scales as $E^{2/3}$, where $E=\max\{|\omega|,T\}$. On the
contrary, the leading term, $\propto E^{-2/3}$, survives for a concave FS. We
also address the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity near the
convex-to-concave transition. Explicit calculations are carried for the
Fermi-liquid regime using the modified (but equivalent to the original) version
of the Kubo formula, while the quantum-critical regime is accessed by employing
the space-time scaling of the $Z=3$ critical theory.

Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits
necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Among the
materials considered for transmon qubits, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a
promising candidate, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence
time. However, the presence of an amorphous surface Ta oxide layer introduces
dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this
study, we present a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum
oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer deposited on top of
tantalum. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies
demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath
the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, we demonstrate that the superconducting
properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting
sharper and higher-temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically
ordered states. Based on the experimental data and computational modeling, we
establish an atomic-scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping
layer in protecting Ta from oxidation. This work provides valuable insights
into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as
well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce
dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, our findings
pave the way for the realization of large-scale, high-performance quantum
computing systems.

<h3>Dirac fermions on wires confined to the graphene Moebius strip</h3>

<br>
<br>
We investigate the effects of the curved geometry on a massless relativistic
electron constrained to a graphene strip with a Moebius strip shape. The
anisotropic and parity-violating geometry of the Moebius band produces a
geometric potential that inherits these features. By considering wires along
the strip width and the strip length, we find exact solutions for the Dirac
equation and the effects of the geometric potential on the electron were
explored. In both cases, the geometric potential yields to a geometric phase on
the wave function. Along the strip width, the density of states depends on the
direction chosen for the wire, a consequence of the lack of axial symmetry.
Moreover, the breaking of the parity symmetry enables the electronic states to
be concentrated on the inner or on the outer portion of the strip. For wires
along the strip length, the nontrivial topology influences the eigenfunctions
by modifying their periodicity. It turns out that the ground state has a period
of $4\pi$ whereas the first excited state is a $2\pi$ periodic function.
Moreover, we found that the energy levels are half-integer multiples of the
energy of the ground state.

<h3>Decoding 122-Type Iron-Based Superconductors: A Comprehensive Simulation  of Phase Diagrams and Transition Temperatures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12615" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12615</a>

<br>
<br>
Iron-based superconductors, a cornerstone of low-temperature physics, have
been the subject of numerous theoretical models aimed at deciphering their
complex behavior. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that
amalgamates several existing models and incorporates experimental data to
simulate the superconducting phase diagrams of the principal 122-type
iron-based compounds. Our model considers a multitude of factors including the
momentum dependence of the superconducting gap, spin-orbital coupling,
antiferromagnetism, spin density wave, induced XY potential on the tetrahedral
structure, and electron-phonon coupling. We have refined the electron-phonon
scattering matrix using experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) data, ensuring that all electrons pertinent to iron-based
superconductivity are accounted for. This innovative approach allows us to
calculate theoretical critical temperature Tc values for Ba1-xKxFe2As2,
CaFe2As2 and SrFe2As2 as functions of pressure. These calculated values exhibit
remarkable agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, our model
predicts that MgFe2As2 remains non-superconducting irrespective of the applied
pressure. Given that 122-type superconductivity at low pressure or low doping
concentration has been experimentally validated, our combined model serves as a
powerful predictive tool for generating superconducting phase diagrams at high
pressure. This study underscores that the high transition temperatures and the
precise doping and pressure dependence of iron-based superconductors are
intrinsically linked to an intertwined mechanism involving a strong interplay
between structural, magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.

<h3>Fingerprints for anisotropic Kondo lattice behavior in the quasiparticle  dynamics of the kagome metal Ni$_3$In</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a temperature- and polarization-resolved phononic and electronic
Raman scattering study in combination with the first-principles calculations on
the kagome metal Ni$_3$In with anisotropic transport properties and non-Fermi
liquid behavior. At temperatures below 50 K and down to 2 K, several Raman
phonon modes, including particularly an interlayer shear mode, exhibit
appreciable frequency and linewidth renormalization, reminiscent of the onset
of the Kondo screening without an accompanying structural or magnetic phase
transition. In addition, a low-energy electronic continuum observed in
polarization perpendicular to the kagome planes reveals strong temperature
dependence below 50 K, implying thermal depletion of incoherent quasiparticles,
while the in-plane continuum remains invariant. These concomitant electronic
and phononic Raman signatures suggest that Ni$_3$In undergoes an anisotropic
electronic crossover from an incoherent to a coherent Kondo lattice regime
below 50 K. We discuss the origin of the anisotropic incoherent-coherent
crossover in association with the possible anisotropic Kondo hybridization
involving localized Ni-$3d_{xz}$ flat-band electrons.

Frustrated magnetic systems can host highly interesting phases known as
classical spin liquids (CSLs), which feature {extensive} ground state
degeneracy and lack long-range magnetic order. Recently, Yan and Benton et al.
proposed a classification scheme of CSLs in the large-$\mathcal{N}$ (soft spin)
limit [arXiv.2305.00155, arXiv:2305.19189]. This scheme classifies CSLs into
two categories: the algebraic CSLs and the fragile topological CSLs, each with
their own correlation properties, low energy effective description, and finer
classification frameworks. In this work, we further develop the classification
scheme by considering the role of crystalline symmetry. We present a
mathematical framework for computing the band representation of the flat bands
in the spectrum of these CSLs, which extends beyond the conventional
representation analysis. It allows one to determine whether the algebraic CSLs,
which features gapless points on their bottom flat bands, are protected by
symmetry or not. It also provides more information on the finer classifications
of algebraic and fragile topological CSLs. We demonstrate this framework via
concrete examples and showcase its power by constructing a pinch-line algebraic
CSL protected by symmetry.

We conjecture that ``Antisymmetrized Geminal Power'' wave functions, and, in
particular, those of extreme type in Coleman's terminology (i.e. with all
geminal coefficients equal), can always be rewritten as antisymmetrized
products of geminals orthogonal to each other. We prove this conjecture in
simple cases and provide numerical evidence that it holds true in more
complicated examples. Establishing the validity of this conjecture is important
as it questions the physical interpretation of AGP wavefunctions.

<h3>Small-Angle X-ray Scattering Unveils the Internal Structure of Lipid  Nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<br>
Lipid nanoparticles own a remarkable potential in nanomedicine, only
partially disclosed. While the clinical use of liposomes and cationic
lipid-nucleic acid complexes is well-established, liquid lipid nanoparticles
(nanoemulsions), solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers
have even greater potential. However, they face obstacles in being used in
clinics due to a lack of understanding about the molecular mechanisms
controlling their drug loading and release, interactions with the biological
environment (such as the protein corona), and shelf-life stability. To create
effective drug delivery carriers and successfully translate bench research to
clinical settings, it is crucial to have a thorough understanding of the
internal structure of lipid nanoparticles. Through synchrotron small-angle
X-ray scattering experiments, we determined the spatial distribution and
internal structure of the nanoparticles' lipid, surfactant, and the water in
them. The nanoparticles themselves have a barrel-like shape that consists of
coplanar lipid platelets (specifically cetyl palmitate) that are partially
covered by polysorbate 80 surfactant and retain a small amount of hydration
water. Although the platelet structure was expected, the presence of surfactant
molecules forming sticky patches between adjacent platelets challenges the
classical core-shell model used to describe solid lipid nanoparticles.
Additionally, the surfactant partially covers the water-nanoparticle interface,
allowing certain lipid regions to come into direct contact with surrounding
water. These structural features play a significant role in drug loading and
release, biological fluid interaction, and nanoparticle stability, making these
findings valuable for the rational design of lipid-based nanoparticles.

<br>
<br>
By ultrafast x-ray diffraction we show that the laser-induced
magnetostructural phase transition in FeRh nanoislands proceeds faster and more
complete than in continuous films. We observe an intrinsic 8 ps timescale for
nucleation of ferromagnetic (FM) domains in both types of samples. For the
continuous film, the substrate-near regions, which are not directly exposed to
light, are only slowly transformed to the FM state by domain wall motion
following heat transport. In contrast, numerical modeling of the plasmonic
absorption in the investigated nanostructure reveals a strong contribution near
the FeRh/MgO interface. On average, the absorption is larger and more
homogeneous in the nanoislands, enabling the phase transition throughout the
entire volume at the intrinsic nucleation timescale.

Here, we report the observation of strong coupling between magnons and
surface acoustic wave (SAW) phonons in a thin CoFeB film constructed in an
on-chip SAW resonator by analyzing SAW phonon dispersion anticrossings. Our
device design provides the tunability of the film thickness with a fixed phonon
wavelength, which is a departure from the conventional approach in strong
magnon--phonon coupling research. We detect a monotonic increase in the
coupling strength by expanding the film thickness, which agrees with our
theoretical model. Our work offers a significant way to advance fundamental
research and the development of devices based on magnon--phonon hybrid
quasiparticles.

<h3>Non-monotonic flow variations in a TASEP-based traffic model featuring  cars searching for parking</h3>

<br>
<i>Valentin Anfray, Alexandre Nicolas</i>
<br>
<br>
The Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) is a paradigm of
out-of-equilibrium Statistical Physics that serves as a simplistic model for
one-way vehicular traffic. Since traffic is perturbed by cars cruising for
parking in many metropolises, we introduce a variant of TASEP, dubbed SFP, in
which particles are initially cruising at a slower speed and aiming to park on
one of the sites adjacent to the main road, described by a unidimensional
lattice. After parking, they pull out at a finite rate and move at a normal
speed. We show that this model, which breaks many of the conservation rules
applicable in other TASEP variants, exhibits singular features, in particular
non-monotonic variations of the steady-state current with the injection rate
and re-entrant transitions in the phase diagram, for some range of parameters.
These features are robust to variations in the update rule and the boundary
conditions.Neither the slow speed of cruising cars nor the perturbation of the
flow due to pull-out maneuvers, taken in isolation, can rationalize these
observations. Instead, they originate in a cramming (or `paper jam') effect
which results from the coupling of these mechanisms: injecting too many cars
into the system saturates the first sites of the road, which prevents parked
cars from pulling out, thus forcing cruising cars to travel farther along the
road.These strong discrepancies with even the qualitative trends of the
baseline TASEP model highlight the importance of considering the effect of
perturbations on traffic.

<br>
Modifying the energy landscape of existing molecular emitters is an
attractive challenge with favourable outcomes in chemistry and organic
optoelectronic research. It has recently been explored through strong
light-matter coupling studies where the organic emitters were placed in an
optical cavity. Nonetheless, a debate revolves around whether the observed
change in the material properties represents novel coupled system dynamics or
the unmasking of pre-existing material properties induced by light-matter
interactions. Here, for the first time, we examined the effect of strong
coupling in polariton organic light-emitting diodes via time-resolved
electroluminescence studies. We accompanied our experimental analysis with
theoretical fits using a model of coupled rate equations accounting for all
major mechanisms that can result in delayed electroluminescence in organic
emitters. We found that in our devices the delayed electroluminescence was
dominated by emission from trapped charges and this mechanism remained
unmodified in the presence of strong coupling.

<h3>Emergence Of Directional Rotation In Optothermally Activated Colloidal  System</h3>

<br>
<br>
We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of directional rotation in
thermally active-passive colloidal structures under optical confinement. The
observed handedness of rotation of the structure can be controlled by changing
the relative position of the constituent colloids. We show that the angular
velocity of rotation is sensitive to the intensity of the incident optical
fields and the size of the constituent colloidal entities. The emergence of
rotational dynamics can be understood in the context of asymmetric temperature
distribution in the system and the relative location of the active colloid,
which creates a local imbalance of optothermal torques to the confined system.
Our work demonstrates how localized optothermal fields lead to directional
rotational dynamics without explicitly utilizing spin or orbital angular
momentum of light. We envisage that our results will have implications in
realizing Brownian engines, and can directly relate to rotational dynamics in
biological and ecological systems.

Resonant driving of electronic transitions with coherent laser sources
creates quantum coherent superpositions of the involved electronic states. Most
time-resolved studies have focused on gases or isolated subsystems embedded in
insulating solids, aiming for applications in quantum information. Here, we
demonstrate coherent control of orbital wavefunctions in pyrochlore
$Tb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}$, which forms an interacting spin liquid ground state. We
show that resonant excitation with a strong THz pulse creates a coherent
superposition of the lowest energy Tb 4f states before the magnetic
interactions eventually dephase them. The coherence manifests itself as a
macroscopic oscillating magnetic dipole, which is detected by ultrafast
resonant x-ray diffraction. The induced quantum coherence demonstrates coherent
control of orbital wave functions, a new tool for the ultrafast manipulation
and investigation of quantum materials.

Electric control of magnetization dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic
materials is an essential step for the development of novel spintronic
nanodevices. Electrostatic gating has been shown to greatly affect the static
magnetic properties of some van der Waals magnets, but the control over their
magnetization dynamics is still largely unexplored. Here we show that the
optically-induced magnetization dynamics in the van der Waals ferromagnet
Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ can be effectively controlled by electrostatic gates, with a
one order of magnitude change in the precession amplitude and over 10% change
in the internal effective field. In contrast to the purely thermally-induced
mechanisms previously reported for 2D magnets, we find that coherent
opto-magnetic phenomena play a major role in the excitation of magnetization
dynamics in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. Our work sets the first steps towards electric
control over the magnetization dynamics in 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors,
demonstrating their potential for applications in ultrafast opto-magnonic
devices.

<br>
The nucleus of eukaryotic cells typically makes up around 30 % of the cell
volume and tends to be up to ten times stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm.
Therefore it is an important element for cell mechanics, but a quantitative
understanding of its mechanical role is largely missing. Here we demonstrate
that elastic phase fields can be used to describe dynamical cell processes in
adhesive or confining environments in which the nucleus plays an important
role. We first introduce and verify our computational method and then study
several applications of large relevance. For cells on adhesive patterns, we
find that nuclear stress is shielded by the adhesive pattern. For cell
compression between two parallel plates, we obtain force-compression curves
that allow us to extract an effective modulus for the cell-nucleus composite.
For micropipette aspiration, the effect of the nucleus on the effective modulus
is found to be much weaker, highlighting the complicated interplay between
extracellular geometry and cell mechanics that is captured by our approach.

<br>
<br>
Co$_2$C nanoparticles (NPs) are amongst transition metal carbides whose
magnetic properties have not been well explored. A recent study by Nirmal Roy
et al. [1] showed that a collection of Co$_2$C NPs exhibit an exchange bias
(EB) effect below T$_{EB}$ = 50 K and also a spin glass (SG) state below
T$_{SG}$ = 5 K. We use magnetic, electrical transport, specific heat, and muon
spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements to explore further the magnetic properties
of these NPs. We uncover the onset of Kondo localization at Kondo temperature
T$_K$ (= 40.1 K), near the onset of EB effect. A crossover from the
Kondo-screened scenario to an RKKY interaction-dominated regime is also
observed for T < T$_K$. Specific heat measurements confirm Kondo localization
and heavy fermionic nature in Co$_2$C at low T. At low T, zero field $\mu$SR
spectra reveal a dominant magnetically disordered fraction with slow relaxation
and a smaller fraction with short-range order exhibiting fast relaxation, with
no evidence of long-range magnetic order. We observe an increase in this fast
relaxation rate between T$_{EB}$ and T$_{SG}$, suggesting a slowing down of the
fluctuating local magnetic environment around muons. Transverse field $\mu$SR
spectra show the emergence of a stable, multi-peaked local magnetic field
distribution below T$_{EB}$. Longitudinal field $\mu$SR spectra shows distinct
changes in the dynamics of fluctuations suggesting the presence of a frozen
glassy like state below 6 K. Our results suggest that below T$_{EB}$, Co$_2$C
NPs pellet develops a magnetic interface, separating disordered and short-range
order fractions. The Exchange interaction that sets in below T$_{EB}$ at the
interface couples them and suppresses the fluctuations. With the suppression of
magnetic fluctuations below T$_{EB}$, strong correlation effects in the
electronic state of Co$_2$C lead to Kondo localization.

<h3>Engineering ferroelectricity in monoclinic hafnia</h3>

<br>
Ferroelectricity in the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS)-compatible hafnia (HfO$_2$) is crucial for the fabrication of
high-integration nonvolatile memory devices. However, the capture of
ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ requires the stabilization of
thermodynamically-metastable orthorhombic or rhombohedral phases, which entails
the introduction of defects (e.g., dopants and vacancies) and pays the price of
crystal imperfections, causing unpleasant wake-up and fatigue effects. Here, we
report a theoretical strategy on the realization of robust ferroelectricity in
HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics by designing a series of epitaxial
(HfO$_2$)$_1$/(CeO$_2$)$_1$ superlattices. The advantages of the designated
ferroelectric superlattices are defects free, and most importantly, on the base
of the thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase of HfO$_2$. Consequently, this
allows the creation of superior ferroelectric properties with an electric
polarization $>$25 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and an ultralow polarization-switching energy
barrier at $\sim$2.5 meV/atom. Our work may open an entirely new route towards
the fabrication of high-performance HfO$_2$ based ferroelectric devices.

<h3>Fractional quantum Hall states with variational Projected Entangled-Pair  States: a study of the bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model</h3>

<br>
<br>
An important class of model Hamiltonians for investigation of topological
phases of matter consists of mobile, interacting particles on a lattice subject
to a semi-classical gauge field, as exemplified by the bosonic
Harper-Hofstadter model. A unique method for investigations of two-dimensional
quantum systems are the infinite projected-entangled pair states (iPEPS), as
they avoid spurious finite size effects that can alter the phase structure.
However, due to no-go theorems in related cases this was often conjectured to
be impossible in the past. In this letter, we show that upon variational
optimization the infinite projected-entangled pair states can be used to this
end, by identifying fractional Hall states in the bosonic Harper-Hofstadter
model. The obtained states are characterized by showing exponential decay of
bulk correlations, as dictated by a bulk gap, as well as chiral edge modes via
the entanglement spectrum.

<br>
We propose the electric field induced thermal Hall effect of triplons in the
quantum dimer magnets $X$CuCl$_{3}$ ($X =$ Tl, K), which exhibit spin-driven
ferroelectricity in the Bose-Einstein condensation phase of triplons. The
interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in these materials leads to
the magnetoelectric effect, i.e., an electric-field induced
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction between spins belonging to the same
dimer. We argue that this intra-dimer DM interaction breaks the symmetry of the
system in the absence of an electric field and gives rise to the thermal Hall
effect, which can be detected in experimentally accessible electric and
magnetic fields. We also show that the thermal Hall effect can be controlled by
changing the strength or direction of the electric field.

<br>
<i>R. Juhász, G. Roósz</i>
<br>
<br>
In transverse-field Ising models, disorder in the couplings gives rise to a
drastic reduction of the critical energy gap and, accordingly, to an
unfavorable, slower-than-algebraic scaling of the density of defects produced
when the system is driven through its quantum critical point. By applying
Kibble-Zurek theory and numerical calculations, we demonstrate in the
one-dimensional model that the scaling of defect density with annealing time
can be made algebraic by balancing the coupling disorder with suitably chosen
inhomogeneous driving fields. Depending on the tail of the coupling
distribution at zero, balancing can be either perfect, leading to the
well-known inverse-square law of the homogeneous system, or partial, still
resulting in an algebraic decrease but with a smaller, non-universal exponent.
We also study defect production during an environment-temperature quench of the
open variant of the model in which the system is slowly cooled down to its
quantum critical point. According to our scaling and numerical results,
balanced disorder leads again to an algebraic temporal decrease of the defect
density.

In contrast to the cuprates, where the proximity of antiferromagnetism (AFM)
and superconductivity is well established, first indications for AFM
interactions in superconducting infinite-layer nickelates were only recently
obtained. Here, we explore, based on first-principles simulations, the nature
of the magnetic coupling in NdNiO2 as a function of the on-site Coulomb and
exchange interaction, varying the explicit hole doping and the treatment of the
Nd $4f$ electrons. The $U$-$J$ phase diagrams for undoped nickelates and
cuprates indicate $G$-type ordering, yet show different $U$ dependency. By
either Sr hole doping or explicit treatment of the Nd $4f$ electrons, we find a
transition to a Ni $C$-type AFM ground state. We trace the effect of Sr doping
back to a distinct accommodation of the holes by the Ni versus Cu $e_g$
orbitals. The interaction between Nd $4f$ and Ni $3d$ states stabilizes
$C$-type AFM order on both sublattices. Though spin-orbit interactions induce a
band splitting near the Fermi energy, the bad-metal state is retained even
under epitaxial strain. These results establish the distinct role of the
magnetic interactions in the nickelates versus the cuprates and suggest the
former as a unique platform to investigate the relation to unconventional
superconductivity.

<h3>Floquet-Anderson localization in the Thouless pump and how to avoid it</h3>

We investigate numerically how onsite disorder affects conduction in the
periodically driven Rice-Mele model, a prototypical realization of the Thouless
pump. Although the pump is robust against disorder in the fully adiabatic
limit, much less is known about the case of finite period time $T$, which is
relevant also in light of recent experimental realizations. We find that at any
fixed period time and nonzero disorder, increasing the system size $L\to\infty$
always leads to a breakdown of the pump, indicating Anderson localization of
the Floquet states. Our numerics indicate, however, that in a properly defined
thermodynamic limit, where $L/T^\theta$ is kept constant, Anderson localization
can be avoided, and the charge pumped per cycle has a well-defined value -- as
long as the disorder is not too strong. The critical exponent $\theta$ is not
universal, rather, its value depends on the disorder strength. Our findings are
relevant for practical, experimental realizations of the Thouless pump, for
studies investigating the nature of its current-carrying Floquet eigenstates,
as well as the mechanism of the full breakdown of the pump, expected if the
disorder exceeds a critical value.

<h3>Influence of surface energy anisotropy on nucleation and  crystallographic texture of polycrystalline deposits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12889" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12889</a>

<br>
<br>
This paper aims to elucidate the role of interface energy anisotropy in
orientation selection during nucleation of new grains in a polycrystalline film
growth. An assessment of (heterogeneous) nucleation probability as function of
orientation of both the bottom grain and of the nucleus was developed (using
the concepts of classical nucleation theory). Novel solutions to the
generalized Winterbottom construction were described in cases of very strong
anisotropy and arbitrary orientations. In order to demonstrate the effect on
the film crystallographic texture, a 2D Monte Carlo algorithm for anisotropic
polycrystalline growth was used to simulate growth of films with columnar
microstructure. The effect of strength of anisotropy, the deposition rate and
initial texture were investigated. Results showed that with larger strength of
anisotropy, the nucleation rate is less dependent on the driving force, but
more dependent on the initial texture. With certain initial textures, the
anisotropic nucleation may even be either impossible or having probability
close to one irrespective of the driving force. Depending on the conditions,
the anisotropic nucleation could hasten the evolution towards the
interface-energy minimizing texture or retard it. Based on these insights, a
hypothesis was offered to explain a peculiar texture evolution in
electrodeposited nickel.

<br>
<br>
Photocurrent matching in conventional monolithic tandem solar cells is
achieved by choosing semiconductors with complementary absorption spectra and
by carefully adjusting the optical properties of the complete top and bottom
stacks. However, for thin film photovoltaic technologies at the module level,
another design variable significantly alleviates the task of photocurrent
matching, namely the cell width, whose modification can be readily realized by
the adjustment of the module layout. Herein we demonstrate this concept at the
experimental level for the first time for a 2T-mechanically stacked perovskite
(FAPbBr3)/organic (PM6:Y6:PCBM) tandem mini-module, an unprecedented approach
for these emergent photovoltaic technologies fabricated in an independent
manner. An excellent Isc matching is achieved by tuning the cell widths of the
perovskite and organic modules to 7.22 mm (PCEPVKT-mod= 6.69%) and 3.19 mm
(PCEOPV-mod= 12.46%), respectively, leading to a champion efficiency of 14.94%
for the tandem module interconnected in series with an aperture area of 20.25
cm2. Rather than demonstrating high efficiencies at the level of small lab
cells, our successful experimental proof-of-concept at the module level proves
to be particularly useful to couple devices with non-complementary
semiconductors, either in series or in parallel electrical connection, hence
overcoming the limitations imposed by the monolithic structure.

The possibility to tune the functional properties of nanomaterials is key to
their technological applications. Superlattices, i.e., periodic repetitions of
two or more materials in different dimensions are being explored for their
potential as materials with tailor-made properties. Meanwhile, nanowires offer
a myriad of possibilities to engineer systems at the nanoscale, as well as to
combine materials which cannot be put together in conventional heterostructures
due to the lattice mismatch. In this work, we investigate GaAs/GaP
superlattices embedded in GaP nanowires and demonstrate the tunability of their
phononic and optoelectronic properties by inelastic light scattering
experiments corroborated by ab initio calculations. We observe clear
modifications in the dispersion relation for both acoustic and optical phonons
in the superlattices nanowires. We find that by controlling the superlattice
periodicity we can achieve tunability of the phonon frequencies. We also
performed wavelength-dependent Raman microscopy on GaAs/GaP superlattice
nanowires and our results indicate a reduction in the electronic bandgap in the
superlattice compared to the bulk counterpart. All our experimental results are
rationalized with the help of ab initio density functional perturbation theory
(DFPT) calculations. This work sheds fresh insights into how material
engineering at the nanoscale can tailor phonon dispersion and open pathways for
thermal engineering.

<h3>Rheological Investigation of The Network Structure in Mixed Gels of  Kappa and Iota Carrageenan</h3>

Carrageenans comprise linear sulfated high molecular weight polysaccharides
obtained from seaweeds and are routinely used in food and home/personal care
industries. Various kinds of carrageenans differ from others based on the ester
sulfate group location on the polysaccharide chains. Pure and mixed systems of
Kappa Carrageenan and Iota Carrageenan undergo a three-dimensional gel network
structure formation or dissociation with a change in temperature. During the
sol-gel and gel-sol transitions, the Carrageenan systems pass through a unique
critical gel state, where dynamic moduli are scale-invariant owing to the
self-similar structure of the three-dimensional network. In this work, we
obtain the critical gel state associated with pure and mixed systems of Kappa
and Iota Carrageenan during cooling and heating by exploring the material
behavior for a range of frequencies. Interestingly, on the one hand, the mixed
gels show a higher critical sol-gel transition temperature compared to the pure
systems at equal individual concentrations. On the other hand, the low
temperature moduli of mixed gels are closer to that of Kappa Carrageenan when
the concentration of the same is more than half in the mixture. The rheological
measurements demonstrate that the Kappa Carrageenan strongly affects the nature
of aggregation of double helices of Iota Carrageenan, but Iota Carrageenan does
not have a significant influence on that of Kappa Carrageenan. These results
suggest an associative, interactive network formation between Kappa and Iota
Carrageenan in the mixture, such that the gel behavior is predominantly
influenced by Kappa Carrageenan.

<br>
<br>
We study the motion of a domain wall on an ultrathin magnetic film using the
magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). At tiny magnetic fields, the wall creeps
only via thermal activation over the pinning centers present in the sample. Our
results show that this creep dynamics is highly intermittent and correlated. A
localized instability triggers a cascade, akin to aftershocks following a large
earthquake, where the pinned wall undergoes large reorganizations in a compact
active region for a few seconds. Surprisingly, the size and shape of these
reorganizations display the same scale-free statistics of the depinning
avalanches in agreement with the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality
class.

<h3>Meso-scale size effects of material heterogeneities on crack propagation  in brittle solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12916" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12916</a>
<br>
<i>Liuchi Li, Jack Rao, Todd Hufnagel, KT Ramesh</i>
<br>
<br>
Brittle solids are often toughened by adding a second-phase material. This
practice often results in composites with material heterogeneities on the meso
scale: large compared to the scale of the process zone but small compared to
that of the application. The specific configuration (both geometrical and
mechanical) of this mesoscale heterogeneity is generally recognized as
important in determining crack propagation and, subsequently, the (effective)
toughness of the composite. Here, we systematically investigate how dynamic
crack propagation is affected by mesoscale heterogeneities taking the form of
an array of inclusions. Using a variational phase-field approach, we compute
the apparent crack speed and fracture energy dissipation rate to compare crack
propagation under Mode-I loading across different configurations of these
inclusions. If fixing the volume fraction of inclusions, matching the inclusion
size to the K-dominance zone size gives rise to the best toughening outcome.
Conversely, if varying the volume fraction of inclusions, a lower volume
fraction configuration can lead to a better toughening outcome if and only if
the inclusion size approaches from above the size of the K-dominance zone.
Since the size of the K-dominance zone can be estimated \textit{a priori} given
an understanding of the application scenario and material availability, we can,
in principle, exploit this estimation to design a material's mesoscale
heterogeneity that optimally balances the tradeoff between strength and
toughness. This paves the way for realizing functional (meta-)materials against
crack propagation in extreme environments.

We introduce a non-linear theory of thermodynamic circuits in non-equilibrium
stationary states. The non-equilibrium conductance matrix of a composite device
is obtained from the ones of its sub-devices. This generalizes to thermodynamic
devices the concept of equivalent impedance defined in electronics. An abstract
example and the serial connection of two thermoelectric generators (TEG) with
constant thermoelectric coefficients are considered. Interestingly, a
current-dependent electrical resistance emerges from this connection.

<br>
<i>Xin-Chi Zhou, Tian-Hua Yang, Zhi-Yuan Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an experimental scheme to realize non-Abelian dynamical gauge
field for ultracold fermions, which induces a novel pairing mechanism of
topological superfluidity. The dynamical gauge fields arise from nontrivial
interplay effect between the strong Zeeman splitting and Hubbard interaction in
a two-dimensional (2D) optical Raman lattice. The spin-flip transitions are
forbidden by the large Zeeman detuning, but are restored when the Zeeman
splitting is compensated by Hubbard interaction. This scheme allows to generate
a dynamical non-Abelian gauge field that leads to a Dirac type correlated 2D
spin-orbit interaction depending on local state configurations. The topological
superfluid from a novel pairing driven by 2D dynamical gauge fields is reached,
with analytic and numerical results being obtained. Our work may open up a door
to emulate non-Abelian dynamical gauge fields and correlated topological phases
with experimental feasibility.

Glass formation in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) has garnered
significant attention in the field of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) in recent
years. Numerous works have been conducted to investigate the microscopic
mechanisms involved in the melting-quenching process of ZIFs. Understanding the
density variations that occur during the melting process of ZIFs is crucial for
comprehending the origins of glass formation. However, conducting large-scale
simulations has been challenging due to limitations in computational resources.
In this work, we utilized deep learning methods to accurately construct a
potential function that describes the atomic-scale melting behavior of Zeolitic
Imidazolate Framework-4 (ZIF-4). The results revealed the spatial heterogeneity
associated with the formation of low-density phases during the melting process
of ZIF-4. This work discusses the advantages and limitations of applying deep
learning simulation methods to complex structures like ZIFs, providing valuable
insights for the development of machine learning approaches in designing
Metal-Organic Framework glasses.

Femtosecond laser excitation of materials that exhibit magnetic spin textures
promises advanced magnetic control via the generation of ultrafast and
non-equilibrium spin dynamics. We explore such possibilities in ferrimagnetic
[Fe(0.35 nm)/Gd(0.40 nm)]$_{160}$ multilayers, which host a rich diversity of
magnetic textures from stripe domains at low magnetic fields, a dense
bubble/skyrmion lattice at intermediate fields, and a single domain state for
high magnetic fields. Using femtosecond magneto-optics, we observe distinct
coherent spin wave dynamics in response to a weak laser excitation allowing us
to unambiguously identify the different magnetic spin textures. Moreover,
employing strong laser excitation we show that we achieve versatile control of
the coherent spin dynamics via non-equilibrium and ultrafast transformation of
magnetic spin textures by both creating and annihilating bubbles/skyrmions. We
corroborate our findings by micromagnetic simulations and by Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy before and after laser exposure.

Using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we determined the
electronic and magnetic properties of a T-phase VS$_2$ bilayer as a function of
tensile and compressive strain. First, we determine the ground state structural
parameters and then the band structure, magnetic anisotropy, exchange
parameters and Curie temperature. Variation of these parameters with the strain
is carefully analysed and described. We show, that the easy-plane anisotropy,
which rather small in the absence of strain, is remarkably enhanced by the
tensile strain and reduced almost to zero by compressive strain. Also magnetic
moment of Vanadium atoms is shown to be reduced by a compressive strain. We
also show that the exchange parameters and the Curie temperature are remarkably
reduced for the compressive strains below roughly -4$\%$.

<br>
<br>
The ability to control the location of nanoscale objects in liquids is
essential for fundamental and applied research from nanofluidics to molecular
biology. To overcome their random Brownian motion, the electrostatic fluidic
trap creates local minima in potential energy by shaping electrostatic
interactions with a tailored wall topography. However, this strategy is
inherently static -- once fabricated the potential wells cannot be modulated.
Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that such a trap can be
controlled through a buried gate electrode.We measure changes in the average
escape times of nanoparticles from the traps to quantify the induced
modulations of $0.7k_\rm{B}T$ in potential energy and 50 mV in surface
potential. Finally, we summarize the mechanism in a parameter-free predictive
model, including surface chemistry and electrostatic fringing, that reproduces
the experimental results. Our findings open a route towards real-time
controllable nanoparticle traps.

<h3>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</h3>

<br>
<i>Vincenzo Alba</i>
<br>
<br>
By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point
correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and
boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian
${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the
correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely,
$L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial
shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the
dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by
a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They
give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be
neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically
long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the
spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe
equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to
derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our
results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.

<br>
<br>
Quantum squeezed states offer metrological enhancement as compared to their
classical counterparts. Here, we devise and numerically explore a novel method
for performing SU(1,1) interferometry beyond the standard quantum limit, using
quasi-cyclic nonlinear wave mixing dynamics of ultracold atoms in a ring
cavity. The method is based on generating quantum correlations between many
atoms via photon mediated optomechanical interaction. Timescales of the
interferometer operation are here given by the inverse of photonic recoil
frequency, and are orders of magnitude shorter than the timescales of
collisional spin-mixing based interferometers. Such shorter timescales should
enable not only faster measurement cycles, but also lower atomic losses from
the trap during measurement, which may lead to significant quantum metrological
gain of matter wave interferometry in state of the art cavity setups.

<h3>Deep learning probability flows and entropy production rates in active  matter</h3>

<br>
<i>Nicholas M. Boffi, Eric Vanden-Eijnden</i>
<br>
<br>
Active matter systems, from self-propelled colloids to motile bacteria, are
characterized by the conversion of free energy into useful work at the
microscopic scale. These systems generically involve physics beyond the reach
of equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a persistent challenge has been to
understand the nature of their nonequilibrium states. The entropy production
rate and the magnitude of the steady-state probability current provide
quantitative ways to do so by measuring the breakdown of time-reversal symmetry
and the strength of nonequilibrium transport of measure. Yet, their efficient
computation has remained elusive, as they depend on the system's unknown and
high-dimensional probability density. Here, building upon recent advances in
generative modeling, we develop a deep learning framework that estimates the
score of this density. We show that the score, together with the microscopic
equations of motion, gives direct access to the entropy production rate, the
probability current, and their decomposition into local contributions from
individual particles, spatial regions, and degrees of freedom. To represent the
score, we introduce a novel, spatially-local transformer-based network
architecture that learns high-order interactions between particles while
respecting their underlying permutation symmetry. We demonstrate the broad
utility and scalability of the method by applying it to several
high-dimensional systems of interacting active particles undergoing
motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). We show that a single instance of our
network trained on a system of 4096 particles at one packing fraction can
generalize to other regions of the phase diagram, including systems with as
many as 32768 particles. We use this observation to quantify the spatial
structure of the departure from equilibrium in MIPS as a function of the number
of particles and the packing fraction.

<br>
<i>Pranay Nayak, Ratheejit Ghosh, Rejish Nath</i>
<br>
<br>
Exploiting the long-range and anisotropic nature of dipole-dipole
interactions, we show that the density of a {\em target} dipolar Bose-Einstein
condensate can be engineered and axially confined using a trapped {\em control}
dipolar condensate. Increasing the number of control condensates leads to
exotic ground state structures, including supersolids and an incoherent array
of density peaks. Single and double-peaked periodic structures are observed as
a function of spacing between the control condensates. Our ideas may be
generalized to engineer any other dipolar quantum system using another one of a
similar dipole character. For instance, a Rydberg atom with electric dipole
moment may be confined and manipulated using a trapped polar molecule and vice
versa via long-range dipole-dipole interactions.

<br>
<br>
A key to understanding unconventional superconductivity lies in unraveling
the pairing mechanism of mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets,
yielding an effective attraction between charges even in the presence of strong
repulsive Coulomb interactions. Here, we study pairing in a minimal model of
bilayer nickelates, featuring robust binding energies - despite dominant
repulsive interactions - that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping
regime. The mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ ladder we study features a crossover
from tightly bound pairs of holes (closed channel) at small repulsion, to more
spatially extended, correlated pairs of individual holes (open channel) at
large repulsion. We derive an effective model for the latter, in which the
attraction is mediated by the closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach
resonances. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we
reveal a dome of large binding energies at around $30\%$ doping and we observe
the formation of a tetraparton density wave of plaquettes consisting of two
spin-charge excitation pairs on neighboring rungs. Our work paves the way
towards a microscopic theory of pairing in doped quantum magnets, in particular
Ni-based superconductors, and our predictions can be tested in state-of-the-art
quantum simulators.
