Two recent preprints gave evidence that a copper-substituted lead apatite,
denoted as CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$OH$_2$ and also known as LK99, could be a
room-temperature superconductor. While other research groups have not yet
replicated the superconductivity in this material, a recent Density Functional
Theory (DFT) calculation indicated the presence of two nearly flat bands near
the Fermi level. Such flat bands are known to exhibit strongly correlated
physics, which could potentially explain the reported high-$T_c$
superconductivity. In order to facilitate the theoretical study of the
intriguing physics associated with these two flat bands, we propose a minimal
tight-binding model which reproduces their main features. We also discuss
implications for superconductivity.

We report on magnetron deposition of thin superconducting rhenium films on
sapphire substrates. During the deposition, substrates were held at ambient
temperature. Critical temperature of the films is Tc~3.6 K. Films have
polycrystalline structure, and grazing incidence X-ray diffractometry indicates
that crystalline lattice parameters are somewhat larger compared to the bulk
ones. Magnetoresistive and AC/DC susceptibilities allowed us to determine
$H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ of these films, as well as estimate coherence length
$\xi$(0) and magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_L$(0). We also provide
information on surface morphology of these films.

The presence of universality of avalanches characterizing the inelastic
response of disordered materials has the potential to bridge the gap from
micro- to macroscale. In this study, we explore the statistics and the scaling
behavior of avalanches in the fracture of silica glass on the microscale using
molecular mechanics. We introduce a robust method for capturing and quantifying
the avalanches, allowing us to perform rigorous statistical analysis, revealing
universal power laws associated with critical phenomena. The computed exponents
suggest that nanoscale fracture of silica belongs to the same universality
class as depinning models. Additionally, the influence of an initial crack is
explored, observing deviations from mean-field predictions while maintaining
criticality. Furthermore, we investigate the strain-dependent probability
density function (PDF), its cutoff function, and the interrelation between the
critical exponents. Finally, we unveil distinct scaling behavior for small and
large avalanches of the crack growth, shedding light on the underlying fracture
mechanisms in silica glass.

<h3>Exact Mazur bounds in the pair-flip model and beyond</h3>

By mapping the calculation of Mazur bounds to the enumeration of walks on
fractal structures, we present exact bounds on the late-time behavior of spin
autocorrelation functions in models exhibiting pair-flip dynamics and more
general $p$-flip dynamics. While the pair-flip model is known to exhibit strong
Hilbert space fragmentation, the effect of its nonlocal conservation laws on
autocorrelation functions has, thus far, only been calculated numerically,
which has led to incorrect conclusions about their thermodynamic behavior.
Here, using exact results, we prove that infinite-temperature autocorrelation
functions exhibit infinite coherence times at the boundary, and that bulk Mazur
bounds decay asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{L}$, rather than $1/L$, as had
previously been thought. This result implies that the nonlocal conserved
operators implied by $p$-flip dynamics have an important qualitative impact on
bulk thermalization properties beyond the constraints imposed by local
symmetries alone.

<h3>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies and web of dualities induced by gauging in  quantum spin chains</h3>

Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorems impose non-perturbative constraints on the
zero-temperature phase diagrams of quantum lattice Hamiltonians (always assumed
to be local in this paper). LSM theorems have recently been interpreted as the
lattice counterparts to mixed 't Hooft anomalies in quantum field theories that
arise from a combination of crystalline and global internal symmetry groups.
Accordingly, LSM theorems have been reinterpreted as LSM anomalies. In this
work, we provide a systematic diagnostic for LSM anomalies in one spatial
dimension. We show that gauging subgroups of the global internal symmetry group
of a quantum lattice model obeying an LSM anomaly delivers a dual quantum
lattice Hamiltonian such that its internal and crystalline symmetries mix
non-trivially through a group extension. This mixing of crystalline and
internal symmetries after gauging is a direct consequence of the LSM anomaly,
i.e., it can be used as a diagnostic of an LSM anomaly. We exemplify this
procedure for a quantum spin-1/2 chain obeying an LSM anomaly resulting from
combining a global internal $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$
symmetry with translation or reflection symmetry. We establish a triality of
models by gauging a
$\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\subset\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$
symmetry in two ways, one of which amounts to performing a Kramers-Wannier
duality, while the other implements a Jordan-Wigner duality. We discuss the
mapping of the phase diagram of the quantum spin-1/2 $XYZ$ chains under such a
triality. We show that the deconfined quantum critical transitions between Neel
and dimer orders are mapped to either topological or conventional
Landau-Ginzburg transitions.

<h3>Quadratic Dirac fermions and the competition of ordered states in  twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00748" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00748</a>

Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) exhibits a captivating phase
diagram as a function of doping, featuring superconductivity and a variety of
insulating and magnetic states. The bands host Dirac fermions with a reduced
Fermi velocity; experiments have shown that the Dirac dispersion reappears near
integer fillings of the moir\'e unit cell -- referred to as the $\textit{Dirac
revival}$ phenomenon. The reduced velocity of these Dirac states leads us to
propose a scenario in which the Dirac fermions possess an approximately
quadratic dispersion. The quadratic momentum dependence and particle-hole
degeneracy at the Dirac point results in a logarithmic enhancement of
interaction effects, which does not appear for a linear dispersion. The
resulting non-trivial renormalisation group (RG) flow naturally produces the
qualitative phase diagram as a function of doping -- with nematic and
insulating states near integer fillings, which give way to superconducting
states past a critical relative doping. The RG method further produces
different results to strong-coupling Hartree-Fock treatments: producing T-IVC
insulating states for repulsive interactions, explaining the results of very
recent STM experiments, alongside nodal $A_2$ superconductivity near
half-filling, whose properties explain puzzles in tunnelling studies of the
superconducting state. The model explains a diverse range of additional
experimental observations, unifying many aspects of the phase diagram of TBG.

<h3>Manipulating Topological Quantum Phase Transitions of Kitaev's Quantum  Spin Liquids with Electric Fields</h3>

Highly entangled excitations such as Majorana fermions of Kitaev quantum spin
liquids have been proposed to be utilized for future quantum science and
technology, and a deeper understanding of such excitations has been strongly
desired. Here we demonstrate that Majorana fermion's mass and associated
topological quantum phase transitions in the Kitaev quantum spin liquids may be
manipulated by using electric fields in sharp contrast to the common belief
that an insulator is inert under weak electric fields due to charge energy
gaps. Using general symmetry analysis with perturbation and exact
diagonalization, we uncover the universal phase diagrams with electric and
magnetic fields. We also provide distinctive experimental signatures to
identify Kitaev quantum spin liquids with electric fields, especially in
connection with the candidate materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl3.

<h3>Dose and compositional dependence of irradiation-induced property change  in FeCr</h3>

Ferritic/martensitic steels will be used as structural components in next
generation nuclear reactors. Their successful operation relies on an
understanding of irradiation-induced defect behaviour in the material. In this
study, Fe and FeCr alloys (3-12%Cr) were irradiated with 20 MeV Fe-ions at 313
K to doses ranging between 0.00008 dpa to 6.0 dpa. This dose range covers six
orders of magnitude, spanning low, transition and high dose regimes. Lattice
strain and hardness in the irradiated material were characterised with
micro-beam Laue X-ray diffraction and nanoindentation, respectively.
Irradiation hardening was observed even at very low doses (0.00008 dpa) and
showed a monotonic increase with dose up to 6.0 dpa. Lattice strain
measurements of samples at 0.0008 dpa allow the calculation of equivalent
Frenkel pair densities and corrections to the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens (NRT)
model for Fe and FeCr alloys at low dose. NRT efficiency for FeCr is 0.2, which
agrees with literature values for high irradiation energy. Lattice strain
increases up to 0.8 dpa and then decreases when the damage dose is further
increased. The strains measured in this study are lower and peak at a larger
dose than predicted by atomistic simulations. This difference can be explained
by taking temperature and impurities into account.

<h3>Possible Eliashberg-type superconductivity enhancement effects in a  two-band superconductor MgB2 driven by narrow-band THz pulses</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study THz-driven condensate dynamics in epitaxial thin films of MgB$_{2}$,
a prototype two-band superconductor (SC) with weak interband coupling. The
temperature and excitation density dependent dynamics follow the behavior
predicted by the phenomenological bottleneck model for the single-gap SC,
implying adiabatic coupling between the two condensates on the ps timescale.
The amplitude of the THz-driven suppression of condensate density reveals an
unexpected decrease in pair-breaking efficiency with increasing temperature -
unlike in the case of optical excitation. The reduced pair-breaking efficiency
of narrow-band THz pulses, displaying minimum near $\approx0.7$ T$_{c}$, is
attributed to THz-driven, long-lived, non-thermal quasiparticle distribution,
resulting in Eliashberg-type enhancement of superconductivity, competing with
pair-breaking.

<h3>Lack of near-sightedness principle in non-Hermitian systems</h3>

The non-Hermitian skin effect is a phenomenon in which an extensive number of
states accumulates at the boundaries of a system. It has been associated to
nontrivial topology, with nonzero bulk invariants predicting its appearance and
its position in real space. Here we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian skin
effect is not a topological phenomenon in general: when translation symmetry is
broken by a single non-Hermitian impurity, skin modes are depleted at the
boundary and accumulate at the impurity site, without changing any bulk
invariant. This may occur even for a fully Hermitian bulk.

<h3>Fatigue crack growth in anisotropic aluminium sheets -- phase-field  modelling and experimental validation</h3>

<br>
Fatigue crack growth is decisive for the design of thin-walled structures
such as fuselage shells of air planes. The cold rolling process, used to
produce the aluminium sheets this structure is made of, leads to anisotropic
mechanical properties. In this contribution, we simulate the fatigue crack
growth with a phase-field model due to its superior ability to model arbitrary
crack paths. A fatigue variable based on the Local Strain Approach describes
the progressive weakening of the crack resistance. Anisotropy regarding the
fracture toughness is included through a structural tensor in the crack surface
density. The model is parameterised for an aluminium AA2024-T351 sheet
material. Validation with a set of experiments shows that the fitted model can
reproduce key characteristics of a growing fatigue crack, including crack path
direction and growth rate, considering the rolling direction.

<h3>Flexible hydrogels connecting adhesion and wetting</h3>

Raindrops falling on window panes spread upon contact, whereas hail can cause
dents or scratches on the same glass window upon contact. While the former
phenomenon resembles classical wetting, the latter is dictated by contact and
adhesion theories. The classical Young-Dupre law applies to the wetting of pure
liquids on rigid solids, whereas conventional contact mechanics theories
account for rigid-on-soft or soft-on-rigid contacts with small deformations in
the elastic limit. However, the crossover between adhesion and wetting is yet
to be fully resolved. The key lies in the study of soft-on-soft interactions
with material properties intermediate between liquids and solids. In this work,
we translate from adhesion to wetting by experimentally probing the static
signature of hydrogels in contact with soft PDMS of varying elasticity of both
the components. Consequently, we probe this transition across six orders of
magnitude in terms of the characteristic elasto-adhesive parameter of the
system. In doing so, we reveal previously unknown phenomenology and a
theoretical model which smoothly bridges adhesion of glass spheres with total
wetting of pure liquids on any given substrate. Lastly, we highlight how solid
like hydrogels can be treated as potential candidates for cleaning impurities
from conventionally sticky PDMS substrates.

<h3>What can the activation energy tell about the energetics at grain  boundaries in polycrystalline organic films?</h3>

Charge-carrier transport at the semiconductor-gate dielectric interface in
organic field-effect transistors is critically dependent on the degree of
disorder in the typically semi-crystalline semiconductor layer. Charge trapping
can occur at the interface as well as in the current-carrying semiconductor
layer itself. A detailed and systematic understanding of the role of grain
boundaries between crystallites and how to avoid their potentially detrimental
effects is still an important focus of research in the organic electronics
community. A typical macroscopic measurement technique to extract information
about the energetics of the grain boundaries is an activation energy
measurement. Here, we compare detailed experiments on the energetic properties
of monolayer thin films implemented in organic field-effect transistors, having
controlled numbers of grain boundaries within the channel region to kinetic
Monte-Carlo simulations of charge-carrier transport to elucidate the influence
of grain boundaries on the extracted activation energies. Two important
findings are: 1) whereas the energy at the grain boundary does not change with
the number of grain boundaries in a thin film, both the measured and simulated
activation energy increases with the number of grain boundaries. 2) In
simulations where both energy barriers and valleys are present at the grain
boundaries there is no systematic relation between the number of grain
boundaries and extracted activation energies. We conclude, that a macroscopic
measurement of the activation energy can serve as general quality indicator of
the thin film, but does not allow microscopic conclusions about the energy
landscape of the thin film.

<h3>Strong-coupling phases of trions and excitons in electron-hole bilayers  at commensurate densities</h3>

We introduce density imbalanced electron-hole bilayers at a commensurate 2 :
1 density ratio as a platform for realizing novel phases involving electrons,
excitons and trions. Three length scales are identified which characterize the
interplay between kinetic energy, intralayer repulsion, and interlayer
attraction. By a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical calculation,
we find a variety of strong-coupling phases in different parameter regions,
including quantum crystals of electrons, excitons, and trions. We also propose
an "excitonic supersolid" phase that features electron crystallization and
exciton superfluidity simultaneously. The material realization and experimental
signature of these phases are discussed in the context of semiconductor
transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.

<h3>Interaction-driven (quasi-) insulating ground states of gapped  electron-doped bilayer graphene</h3>

Bernal bilayer graphene has recently been discovered to exhibit a wide range
of unique ordered phases resulting from interaction-driven effects and
encompassing spin and valley magnetism, correlated insulators, correlated
metals, and superconductivity. This letter reports on a novel family of
correlated phases characterized by spin and valley ordering, observed in
electron-doped bilayer graphene. The novel correlated phases demonstrate an
intriguing non-linear current-bias behavior at ultralow currents that is
sensitive to the onset of the phases and is accompanied by an insulating
temperature dependence, providing strong evidence for the presence of
unconventional charge carrying degrees of freedom originating from ordering.
These characteristics cannot be solely attributed to any of the previously
reported phases, and are qualitatively different from the behavior seen
previously on the hole-doped side. Instead, our observations align with the
presence of charge- or spin-density-waves state that open a gap on a portion of
the Fermi surface or fully gapped Wigner crystals. The resulting new phases,
quasi-insulators in which part of the Fermi surface remains intact or
valley-polarized and valley-unpolarized Wigner crystals, coexist with
previously known Stoner phases, resulting in an exceptionally intricate phase
diagram.

Motivated by the recent experimental progress in studying conventional and
unconventional superconductors in a pump-probe setup, we perform a
comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonlinear response of a diffusive BCS
conventional superconductor to the action of an alternating electromagnetic
field using a generalized Usadel equation. We analyze the response up to the
second order of the perturbation in the amplitude of the vector potential
$\vec{A}$, the superconducting order parameter $\Delta$ and in the third order
for the current $\vec{j}$. On the basis of this approach, we derive general
expressions for the retarded (advanced) Green's functions, as well as the
Keldysh function for an arbitrary number of harmonics of the incident field.
Most importantly, we analyze the set of physical observables in a
non-equilibrium superconductor, such as frequency and the temperature
dependencies of the zero harmonic $\delta( \Delta)_0$ (Eliashberg effect), the
second harmonic $\delta( \Delta)_{2\Omega}$, as well as the third harmonic for
the electric current $j(3\Omega)$ under the action of a monochromatic
irradiation. For the same set of parameters, we also analyze the behavior of
the reflectivity and the down-conversion intensity of a thin superconducting
film, discussed recently in the context of parametric amplification of
superconductivity. We derive these quantities microscopically and show the
connection of the down-conversion intensity to the third harmonic generation
currents induced by the amplitude mode and the direct action of the electric
field on the charge carriers.

Van-der-Waals (vdW) assembly enables the fabrication of novel Josephson
junctions utilizing an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated and
relatively twisted $\rm{Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}}$ (Bi2212) flakes. In a range of
twist angles around $45^\circ$, the junction provides a regime where the
interlayer two-Cooper pair tunneling dominates the current-phase relation. Here
we propose to employ this novel junction to realize a capacitively shunted
qubit that we call flowermon. The $d$-wave nature of the order parameter endows
the flowermon with inherent protection against charge-noise-induced relaxation
and quasiparticle-induced dissipation. This inherently protected qubit paves
the way to a new class of high-coherence hybrid superconducting quantum devices
based on unconventional superconductors.

The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a paradigmatic
lattice model for one-dimensional particle transport subject to excluded-volume
interactions. Solving the inhomogeneous TASEP in which particles' hopping rates
vary across the lattice is a long-standing problem. In recent years, a power
series approximation (PSA) has been developed to tackle this problem, however
no computer algorithm currently exists that implements this approximation. This
paper addresses this issue by providing a Python-based package TASEPy that
finds the steady state solution of the inhomogeneous TASEP for any set of
hopping rates using the PSA truncated at a user-defined order.

<h3>Giant superconducting diode effect in ion-beam patterned Sn-based  superconductor nanowire / topological Dirac semimetal planar heterostructures</h3>

Superconductor/topological material heterostructures are intensively studied
as a platform for topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. However,
the high cost of nanofabrication and the difficulty of preparing high-quality
interfaces between the two dissimilar materials are common obstacles that
hinder the observation of intrinsic physics and the realisation of scalable
topological devices and circuits. Here, we demonstrate an innovative method to
directly draw nanoscale superconducting beta-tin (beta-Sn) patterns of any
shape in the plane of a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) alpha-tin (alpha-Sn)
thin film by irradiating a focused ion beam (FIB). We utilise the property that
alpha-Sn undergoes a phase transition to superconducting beta-Sn upon heating
by FIB. In beta-Sn nanowires embedded in a TDS alpha-Sn thin film, we observe
giant non-reciprocal superconducting transport, where the critical current
changes by 69% upon reversing the current direction. The superconducting diode
rectification ratio reaches a maximum when the magnetic field is applied
parallel to the current, distinguishing itself from all the previous reports.
Moreover, it oscillates between alternate signs with increasing magnetic field
strength. The angular dependence of the rectification ratio on the magnetic
field and current directions is similar to that of the chiral anomaly effect in
TDS alpha-Sn, suggesting that the non-reciprocal superconducting transport may
occur at the beta-Sn/alpha-Sn interfaces. The ion-beam patterned Sn-based
superconductor/TDS planar structures thus show promise as a universal platform
for investigating novel quantum physics and devices based on topological
superconducting circuits of any shape.

Topological insulators provide great potentials to control diffusion
phenomena as well as waves. Here, we show that the direction of thermal
diffusion can be selected by the contributions of the topologically protected
edge modes via the quantum spin Hall effect in a honeycomb-shaped structure. We
demonstrate that when we set our structure to the temperature corresponding to
the type of edge mode, the direction of thermal diffusion can be tuned.
Moreover, this diffusion system is found to be immune to defects owing to the
robustness of topological states. Our work points to exciting new avenues for
controlling diffusion phenomena.

We report the ground-state symmetry of the Ce $4f$ states in the heavy
fermion superconductor CeNi$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$, yielding anisotropic
$cf$-hybridization between the Ce $4f$ states and conducting electrons. By
analyzing linear dichroism in soft x-ray absorption and core-level hard x-ray
photoemission spectra, the $4f$ symmetry is determined as $\Sigma$-type
$\Gamma_{7}$, promoting predominant hybridization with the conducting electrons
originating from the Ge site. The band structures probed by the soft x-ray
angle-resolved photoemission indicates that the Ge $4p$ components contribute
to the band renormalization through the anisotropic hybridization effects,
suggesting that the control of the electronic structures of Ge orbital gives an
impact to achieve the exotic phenomena in CeNi$_{2}$Ge$_{2}$.

<h3>Reversible superconducting-normal phase transition in a magnetic field:  The energy-momentum balance including the velocity field of the Berry  connection from many-body wave functions</h3>

<br>
<br>
The velocity field composed of the Berry connection from many-body wave
functions and electromagnetic vector potential explains the energy-momentum
balance during the reversible superconducting-normal phase transition in the
presence of an externally applied magnetic field. In this formalism, forces
acting on electrons are the Lorentz force and force expressed as the gradient
of the kinetic energy. In the stationary situation, they balance; however, an
infinitesimal imbalance of them causes a phase boundary shift. In order to
explain the energy balance during this phase boundary shift, the electromotive
force of the Faraday's magnetic induction type is considered for the Berry
connection. This theory assumes that supercurrent exists as a collection of
stable quantized loop currents, and the transition from the superconducting to
normal phase is due to the loss of their stabilizations through the thermal
fluctuation of the winding numbers of the loop currents. We argue that an
abrupt change of loop current states with integral quantum numbers should be
treated as a quantum transition; then, the direct conversion of the quantized
loop currents to the magnetic field occurs; consequently, the Joule heat
generation does not occur during the phase transition.

An in-situ Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) method for soft matter developed
by our group [Wu. et.al. 2022] encounters the problem of irregular samples,
which significantly vary in shape and size in practice, therefore a standard
sample "large enough" to ignore the boundary and size effects is necessary to
determine the baseline of test and build the correspondence between this new
method to classical mechanical tests. In this work, we use finite element
analysis to approach the optimal size of a brick sample where the stress on the
boundaries in three spatial directions are ignorable, and certified the results
by testing a series of silicone gel samples on the in-situ DMA device. The
stress-strain of tensile and compression are characterized. The material
properties of gel are chosen to be close to the biological soft tissue. The
size of 40mm(L)*40mm(W)*20mm(H) is determined to be the optimal result.

The unambiguous detection of the Majorana zero mode (MZM), which is essential
for future topological quantum computing, has been a challenge in recent
condensed matter experiments. The MZM is expected to emerge at the vortex core
of topological superconductors as a zero-energy vortex bound state (ZVBS),
amenable to detection using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy
(STM/STS). However, the typical energy resolution of STM/STS has made it
challenging to distinguish the MZM from the low-lying trivial vortex bound
states. Here, we review the recent high-energy-resolution STM/STS experiments
on the vortex cores of Fe(Se,Te), where the MZM is expected to emerge, and the
energy of the lowest trivial bound states is reasonably high. Tunneling spectra
taken at the vortex cores exhibit a ZVBS well below any possible trivial state,
suggesting its MZM origin. However, it should be noted that ZVBS is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for the MZM; a qualitative feature unique to the
MZM needs to be explored. We discuss the current status and issues in the
pursuit of such Majorananess, namely the level sequence of the vortex bound
states and the conductance plateau of the ZVBS. We also argue for future
experiments to confirm the Majorananess, such as the detection of the doubling
of the shot noise intensity and spin polarization of the MZM.

<br>
<br>
The nano-bridge junction (NBJ) is a type of Josephson junction that is
advantageous for the miniaturization of superconducting circuits. However, the
current-phase relation (CPR) of the NBJ usually deviates from a sinusoidal
function which has been explained by a simplified model with correlation only
to its effective length. Here, we investigated both measured and calculated
CPRs of niobium NBJs of a cuboidal shape with a three-dimensional bank
structure. From a sine-wave to a saw-tooth-like form, we showed that deviated
CPRs of NBJs can be described quantitatively by its skewness {\Delta}{\theta}.
Furthermore, the measured dependency of {\Delta}{\theta} on the critical
current {I_0} from 108 NBJs turned out to be consistent with the calculated
ones derived from the change in geometric dimensions. It suggested that the
CPRs of NBJs can be tuned by their geometric dimensions. In addition, the
calculated scaling behavior of {\Delta}{\theta} versus {I_0} in
three-dimensional space was provided for the future design of superconducting
circuits of a high integration level by using niobium NBJs.

<h3>Light Driven Spontaneous Phonon Chirality and Magnetization in  Paramagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spin-phonon coupling enables the mutual manipulation of phonon and spin
degrees of freedom in solids. In this study, we reveal the inherent
nonlinearity within this coupling. Using a paramagnet as an illustration, we
demonstrate the nonlinearity by unveiling spontaneous symmetry breaking under a
periodic drive. The drive originates from linearly polarized light, respecting
a mirror reflection symmetry of the system. However, this symmetry is
spontaneously broken in the steady state, manifested in the emergence of
coherent chiral phonons accompanied by a nonzero magnetization. We establish an
analytical self-consistent equation to find the parameter regime where
spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. Furthermore, we estimate realistic
parameters and discuss potential materials that could exhibit this behavior.
Our findings shed light on the exploration of nonlinear phenomena in magnetic
materials and present possibilities for on-demand control of magnetization.

<h3>Over-Barrier Photoelectron Emission with Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00952" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00952</a>
<br>
<i>Bi Hong Tiang, Yee Sin Ang, L. K. Ang</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theoretical model to calculate the quantum efficiency (QE) of
photoelectron emission from materials with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC)
effect. In the low temperature limit, an analytical scaling between QE and the
RSOC strength is obtained as QE $\propto (\hbar\omega-W)^2+2E_R(\hbar \omega-W)
-E_R^2/3$, where $\hbar\omega$, $W$ and $E_R$ are the incident photon energy,
work function and the RSOC parameter respectively. Intriguingly, the RSOC
effect substantially improves the QE for strong RSOC materials. For example,
the QE of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi/Si(111) increases, by 149\% and 122\%,
respectively due to the presence of strong RSOC. By fitting to the
photoelectron emission characteristics, the analytical scaling law can be
employed to extract the RSOC strength, thus offering a useful tool to
characterize the RSOC effect in materials. Importantly, when the traditional
Fowler-Dubridge model is used, the extracted results may substantially deviate
from the actual values by $\sim90\%$, thus highlighting the importance of
employing our model to analyse the photoelectron emission especially for
materials with strong RSOC. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for
the design of photoemitters using Rashba spintronic materials.

<h3>Gate-Tunable Critical Current of the Three-Dimensional Niobium  Nano-Bridge Josephson Junction</h3>

<i>Shujie Yu, Lei Chen, Yinping Pan, Yue Wang, Denghui Zhang, Guangting Wu, Xinxin Fan, Xiaoyu Liu, Ling Wu, Lu Zhang, Wei Peng, Jie Ren, Zhen Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies have shown that the critical currents of several metallic
superconducting nanowires and Dayem bridges can be locally tuned using a gate
voltage {V_g}. Here, we report a gate-tunable Josephson junction structure
constructed from a three-dimensional (3D) niobium nano-bridge junction (NBJ)
with a voltage gate on top. Measurements up to 6 K showed that the critical
current of this structure can be tuned to zero by increasing {V_g}. The
critical gate voltage Vgc was reduced to 16 V and may possibly be reduced
further by reducing the thickness of the insulation layer between the gate and
the NBJ. Furthermore, the flux modulation generated by Josephson interference
of two parallel 3D NBJs can also be tuned using {V_g} in a similar manner.
Therefore, we believe that this gate-tunable Josephson junction structure is
promising for superconducting circuit fabrication at high integration levels.

<h3>Spin wave amplification through superradiance</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00962" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00962</a>
<br>
<i>X. R. Wang, X. Gong, K. Y. Jing</i>
<br>
<br>
Superradiance is a phenomenon of multiple facets that occurs in classical and
quantum physics under extreme conditions. Here we present its manifestation in
spin waves under an easily realized condition. We show that an interface
between a current-free (normal) ferromagnetic (FM) region and a current-flow
(pumped) FM region can be a spin wave super-mirror whose reflection coefficient
is larger than 1. The super-reflection is the consequence of current-induced
spectrum inversion where phase and group velocities of spin waves are in the
opposite directions. An incident spin wave activates a backward propagating
refractive wave inside pumped FM region. The refractive spin wave re-enters the
normal FM region to constructively interfere with the reflective wave. It
appears that the pumped FM region coherently emits reflective waves, leading to
a super-reflection. The process resembles superradiance of a spinning black
hole through the Hawking radiation process, or Dicke superradiance of cavity
photons inside population inverted media.

<br>

We introduce an auxiliary-particle field theory to treat the non-Markovian
dynamics of driven-dissipative quantum systems of the Jaynes-Cummings type. It
assigns an individual quantum field to each reservoir state and provides an
analytic, faithful representation of the coupled system-bath dynamics. We apply
the method to a driven-dissipative photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
coupled to a reservoir of dye molecules with electronic and vibronic
excitations. The complete phase diagram of this system exhibits a hidden,
non-Hermitian phase transition separating temporally oscillating from
biexponentially decaying photon density correlations within the BEC. On one
hand, this provides a qualitative distinction of the thermal photon BEC from a
laser. On the other hand, it shows that one may continuously tune from the BEC
to the lasing phase by circumventing a critical point. This auxiliary-particle
method is generally applicable to the dynamics of open, non-Markovian quantum
systems.

<h3>Reduced-Order Model to Predict Thermal Conductivity of  Dimensionally-Confined Materials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Predicting nanoscale thermal transport in dielectrics requires models, such
as the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), that account for phonon boundary
scattering in structures with complex geometries. Although the BTE has been
validated against several key experiments, its computational expense limits its
applicability. Here, we demonstrate the use of an analytic reduced-order model
for predicting the thermal conductivity in dimensionally confined materials,
i.e., monolithic and porous thin films, and rectangular and cylindrical
nanowires. The approach uses the recently developed "Ballistic Correction
Model" (BCM) which accounts for materials' full distribution of phonon
mean-free-paths. The model is validated against BTE simulations for a selection
of base materials, obtaining excellent agreement. By furnishing a precise yet
easy-to-use prediction of thermal transport in nanostructures, our work strives
to accelerate the identification of materials for energy-conversion and
thermal-management applications.

<h3>Clausius formula and the Second law in the process of thermalization</h3>

<br>
<i>Vansh Narang, Ramandeep S. Johal</i>
<br>
<br>
An adiabatic thermalization between $n$ bodies is an irreversible process,
leading to a rise in the total entropy of the bodies and yields a final common
temperature $T_F$. We express the Clausius formula that computes the entropy
change between the initial non-equilibrium state and the final equilibrium
state, using another equilibrium state of the $n$ bodies for the given initial
entropy, that corresponds to a temperature $T_f$. The second law inequality
follows from the fact $T_f < T_F$, under the assumption of positive heat
capacities of the bodies. We derive this inequality for the discrete case of
$n$ bodies as well as the continuum case of an unequally heated rod. As an
example, we illustrate our results for the case of temperature-independent heat
capacity.

<h3>Ranking species in complex ecosystems through nestedness maximization</h3>

<br>
<i>Manuel Sebastian Mariani, Dario Mazzilli, Aurelio Patelli, Flaviano Morone</i>
<br>
<br>
Identifying the rank of species in a social or ecological network is a
difficult task, since the rank of each species is invariably determined by
complex interactions stipulated with other species. Simply put, the rank of a
species is a function of the ranks of all other species through the adjacency
matrix of the network. A common system of ranking is to order species in such a
way that their neighbours form maximally nested sets, a problem called nested
maximization problem (NMP). Here we show that the NMP can be formulated as an
instance of the Quadratic Assignment Problem, one of the most important
combinatorial optimization problem widely studied in computer science,
economics, and operations research. We tackle the problem by Statistical
Physics techniques: we derive a set of self-consistent nonlinear equations
whose fixed point represents the optimal rankings of species in an arbitrary
bipartite mutualistic network, which generalize the Fitness-Complexity
equations widely used in the field of economic complexity. Furthermore, we
present an efficient algorithm to solve the NMP that outperforms
state-of-the-art network-based metrics and genetic algorithms. Eventually, our
theoretical framework may be easily generalized to study the relationship
between ranking and network structure beyond pairwise interactions, e.g. in
higher-order networks.

<h3>Percolation in higher order networks via mapping to chygraphs</h3>

Percolation theory investigates systems of interconnected units, their
resilience to damage and their propensity to propagation. For random networks
we can solve the percolation problems analytically using the generating
function formalism. Yet, with the introduction of higher order networks, the
generating function calculations are becoming difficult to perform and harder
to validate. Here, I illustrate the mapping of percolation in higher order
networks to percolation in chygraphs. Chygraphs are defined as a set of
complexes where complexes are hypergraphs with vertex sets in the set of
complexes. In a previous work I reported the generating function formalism to
percolation in chygraphs and obtained an analytical equation for the order
parameter. Taking advantage of this result, I recapitulate analytical results
for percolation problems in higher order networks and report extensions to more
complex scenarios using symbolic calculations.

We investigate the electronic structure of $2H$-$\mathrm{Nb}\mathrm{S}_2$ and
$h$$\mathrm{BN}$ by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and
photoemission intensity calculations. Although in bulk form, these materials
are expected to exhibit band degeneracy in the $k_z=\pi/c$ plane due to screw
rotation and time-reversal symmetries, we observe gapped band dispersion near
the surface. We extract from first-principles calculations the near-surface
electronic structure probed by ARPES and find that the calculated photoemission
spectra from the near-surface region reproduce the gapped ARPES spectra. Our
results show that the near-surface electronic structure can be qualitatively
different from the bulk one due to partially broken nonsymmorphic symmetries.

Two dimensional topological superconductors with chiral edge modes are
predicted to posses a quantized thermal Hall effect, exactly half that for
chiral topological insulators, which is proportional to the Chern number.
However not much work has been done in identifying this in the standard models
in the literature. Here we introduce a model based on a proximity induced
superconducting Bismuth bilayer, to directly calculate the thermal Hall
conductance based on the lattice model. This model serves as a demonstration of
the state of the art possible in such a calculation, as well as introducing an
interesting paradigmatic topological superconductor with a rich phase diagram.
We demonstrate the quantized thermal Hall plateaus in several different
topological phases, and compare this to numerical calculations of the Chern
number, as well as analytical calculations of the Chern number's parity
invariant. We demonstrate that it is possible to get a reasonable topological
phase diagram from the quantized thermal Hall calculations.

<br>
Understanding spin-lattice interactions in antiferromagnets is one of the
most fundamental issues at the core of the recently emerging and booming fields
of antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnonics. Recently, coherent nonlinear
spin-lattice coupling was discovered in an antiferromagnet which opened the
possibility to control the nonlinear coupling strength and thus showing a novel
pathway to coherently control magnon-phonon dynamics. Here, utilizing intense
narrow band terahertz (THz) pulses and tunable magnetic fields up to 7 T, we
experimentally realize the conditions of the Fermi magnon-phonon resonance in
antiferromagnetic $CoF_{2}$. These conditions imply that both the spin and the
lattice anharmonicities harvest energy transfer between the subsystems, if the
magnon eigenfrequency $f_{m}$ is twice lower than the frequency of the phonon
$2f_{m}=f_{ph}$. Performing THz pump-infrared probe spectroscopy in conjunction
with simulations, we explore the coupled magnon-phonon dynamics in the vicinity
of the Fermi-resonance and reveal the corresponding fingerprints of an
impulsive THz-induced response. This study focuses on the role of nonlinearity
in spin-lattice interactions, providing insights into the control of coherent
magnon-phonon energy exchange.

In Josephson diodes the asymmetry between positive and negative current
branch of the current-phase relation leads to a polarity-dependent critical
current and Josephson inductance. The supercurrent nonreciprocity can be
described as a consequence of the anomalous Josephson effect -- a
$\varphi_0$-shift of the current-phase relation -- in multichannel ballistic
junctions with strong spin-orbit interaction. In this work, we simultaneously
investigate $\varphi_0$-shift and supercurrent diode efficiency on the same
Josephson junction by means of a superconducting quantum interferometer. By
electrostatic gating, we reveal a direct link between $\varphi_0$-shift and
diode effect. Our findings show that the supercurrent diode effect mainly
results from magnetochiral anisotropy induced by spin-orbit interaction in
combination with a Zeeman field.

Electron-phonon coupling is a fundamental process that governs the energy
relaxation dynamics of solids excited by ultrafast laser pulses. It has been
found to strongly depend on electron temperature as well as on nonequilibrium
effects. Recently, the effect of occupational nonequilibrium in noble metals,
which outlasts the fully kinetic stage, has come into increased focus. In this
work, we investigate the influence of nonequilibrium density distributions in
gold on the electron-phonon coupling. We find a large effect on the coupling
parameter which describes the energy exchange between the two subsystems. Our
results challenge the conventional view that electron temperature alone is a
sufficient predictor of electron-phonon coupling.

Recently, several experiments reported that the magnetic field interference
pattern of the quantum hall edge states mediated Josephson junctions can
exhibit Fraunhofer oscillations with a periodicity of either $h/e$ or $h/2e$.
However, a unified understanding of such a phenomenon is still absent. In this
work, we show that the competition between local Andreev reflections and
crossed Andreev reflections results in the crossover between $h/e$ and $h/2e$
quantum oscillations in chiral edge-channel Josephson junctions. Our theory
explains why recent experiments observed either $h/e$ or $h/2e$ oscillations in
different samples. Furthermore, we predict a thermal-driven $h/e$ to $h/2e$
Fraunhofer oscillations crossover.

We study the effects of magnetization on the properties of the doped
topological insulator with nematic superconductivity. We found that the
direction of the in-plane magnetization fixes the direction of the nematicity
in the system. The chiral state is more favorable than the nematic state for
large values of out-of-plane magnetization. Overall, the critical temperature
of the nematic state is resilient against magnetization. We explore the
spectrum of the system with the pinned direction of the nematic order parameter
$\Delta_{y}$ in details. Without magnetization, there is a full gap in the
spectrum. At strong enough out-of-plane $m_z$ or orthogonal in-plane $m_x$
magnetization, the spectrum is closed at the nodal points that are split by the
magnetization. Flat Majorana surface states connect such split bulk nodal
points. Parallel magnetization $m_y$ lifts nodal points and opens a full gap in
the spectrum. We discuss relevant experiments and propose experimental
verifications of our theory.

The statistics of the diffusive motion of particles often serve as an
experimental proxy for their interaction with the environment. However,
inferring the physical properties from the observed trajectories is
challenging. Inspired by a recent experiment, here we analyze the problem of
particles undergoing two-dimensional Brownian motion with transient tethering
to the surface. We model the problem as a Hidden Markov Model where the
physical position is observed, and the tethering state is hidden. We develop an
alternating maximization algorithm to infer the hidden state of the particle
and estimate the physical parameters of the system. The crux of our method is a
saddle-point-like approximation, which involves finding the most likely
sequence of hidden states and estimating the physical parameters from it.
Extensive numerical tests demonstrate that our algorithm reliably finds the
model parameters, and is insensitive to the initial guess. We discuss the
different regimes of physical parameters and the algorithm's performance in
these regimes. We also provide a ready-to-use open source implementation of our
algorithm.

A series of FeSe0.5Te0.5 bulk samples have been prepared through the high gas
pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method to optimize the growth
conditions, for the first time and investigated for their superconducting
properties using structural, microstructure, transport, and magnetic
measurements to reach the final conclusions. Ex-situ and in-situ processes are
used to prepare bulk samples under a range of growth pressures using Ta-tube
and without Tatube. The parent compound synthesized by convenient synthesis
method at ambient pressure (CSP) exhibits a superconducting transition
temperature of 14.8 K. Our data demonstrate that the prepared FeSe0.5Te0.5
sealed in a Ta-tube is of better quality than the samples without a Ta-tube,
and the optimum growth conditions (500 MPa, 600{\deg}C for 1 h) are favourable
for the development of the tetragonal FeSe0.5Te0.5 phase. The optimum bulk
FeSe0.5Te0.5 depicts a higher transition temperature of 17.3 K and a high
critical current density of the order of >10^4 A/cm^2 at 0 T, which is improved
over the entire magnetic field range and almost twice higher than the parent
compound prepared through CSP. Our studies confirm that the high-pressure
synthesis method is a highly efficient way to improve the superconducting

a superconductor.

Two recent preprints in physics archive (arXiv) have called the attention as
they claim experimental evidence that a Cu-substituted apatite material (called
LK-99) exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and pressure. If this
proves to be true, LK-99 will be the holy grail of superconductors. In this
work, we used Density-Functional Theory calculations to elucidate some key
features of the electronic structure of LK-99. Although some aspects of our
calculations are preliminary, we found that: i) in the ground state of the
material the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations are practically
degenerated, ii) the material is metallic, iii) the Cu atoms seem to be hosts
in the lattice with not covalent bonds to other atoms and supporting almost
flat bands around the Fermi level, and iv) the electron-phonon coupling of
these flat bands seems to be dramatically large.

Spin-dependent electron tunneling through a voltage-biased micro-constriction
between two bulk superconductors is shown to create a static magnetization near
the constriction and an ac Josephson-like spin current. Although spin-dependent
tunneling generates quantum spin fluctuations even in the absence of a bias,
the formation of spin-triplet Cooper pairs necessary for the creation of
magnetization is blocked by destructive interference between different
quasi-electron and quasi-hole tunneling channels, unless there is an asymmetry
between the tunneling densities of states for electrons and holes. Breaking the
symmetry in the electron-hole tunnel density of states and creating
electron-hole tunneling imbalance by biasing the device destroys the
destructive interference and enables triplet Cooper-pair formation. As a
result, magnetizing the superconductor becomes possible. The role of the
voltage in lifting the blockade hindering the spin-triplet Cooper pair
formation is an example of an electrically-controlled dissipation-less
spintronic phenomenon.

<h3>Minimal effective model and possible high-$T_{c}$ mechanism for  superconductivity of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure</h3>

The recent discovery of high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelate
La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure has stimulated great interest
concerning its pairing mechanism. We argue that the weak coupling model from
the almost fully-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ bonding band cannot give rise to its high
$T_{c}$, and thus propose a strong coupling model based on local inter-layer
spin singlets of Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ electrons due to their strong on-site Coulomb
repulsion. This leads to a minimal effective model that contains local pairing
of $d_{z^{2}}$ electrons and a considerable hybridization with near
quarter-filled itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons on nearest-neighbor sites.
The strong coupling between two components provides a composite scenario to
achieve high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity. Our theory highlights the importance of
the bilayer structure of superconducting La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and points out
a potential route for the exploration of more high-$T_{c}$ superconductors.

Quantum coherence of electrons can produce striking behaviors in mesoscopic
conductors, including weak localization and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Although
magnetic order can also strongly affect transport, the combination of coherence
and magnetic order has been largely unexplored. Here, we examine quantum
coherence-driven universal conductance fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic,
canted antiferromagnetic, and ferromagnetic phases of a thin film of the
topological material MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. In each magnetic phase we extract a charge
carrier phase coherence length of about 100 nm. The conductance
magnetofingerprint is repeatable when sweeping applied magnetic field within
one magnetic phase, but changes when the applied magnetic field crosses the
antiferromagnetic/canted antiferromagnetic magnetic phase boundary.
Surprisingly, in the antiferromagnetic and canted antiferromagnetic phase, but
not in the ferromagnetic phase, the magnetofingerprint depends on the direction
of the field sweep. To explain these observations, we suggest that conductance
fluctuation measurements are sensitive to the motion and nucleation of magnetic
domain walls in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.

In this paper we establish a connection between density functional theory
(DFT) for lattice models and common real-space DFT. We consider the lattice DFT
description of a two-level model subject to generic interactions in Mermin's
DFT formulation in the grand canonical ensemble at finite temperature. The case
of only density-density and Hund's rule interaction studied in earlier work is
shown to be equivalent to an exact-exchange description of DFT in the
real-space picture. In addition, we also include the so-called pair-hopping
interaction which can be treated analytically and, crucially, leads to
non-integer occupations of the Kohn-Sham levels even in the limit of zero
temperature. Treating the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis is shown to be
equivalent to our two-level lattice DFT model. By means of the fractional
occupations of the KS orbitals (which, in this case, are identical to the
many-body ones) we reproduce the results of full configuration interaction,
even in the dissociation limit and without breaking the spin symmetry. Beyond
the minimal basis, we embed our HOMO-LUMO model into a standard DFT calculation
and, again, obtain results in overall good agreement with exact ones without
the need of breaking the spin symmetry.

The presented work is focused on the optical and magneto-optical
characterization of TeO2-ZnO-BaO (TZB) tellurite glasses. We investigated the
refractive index and extinction coefficient dispersion by spectroscopic
ellipsometry from ultraviolet, 0.193 um, up to mid infrared, 25 um spectral
region. Studied glasses exhibited large values of linear (n632 = 1.91-2.09) and
non-linear refractive index (n2 = 1.20-2.67x10-11 esu), Verdet constant (V632 =
22-33 radT-1m-1) and optical band gap energy (Eg = 3.7-4.1 eV). The materials
characterization revealed that BaO substitution by ZnO leads (at constant
content of TeO2) to an increase in linear and nonlinear refractive index as
well as Verdet constant while the optical band gap energy decreases. Fiber
drawing ability of TeO2-ZnO-BaO glassy system has been demonstrated on
60TeO2-20ZnO-20BaO glass with presented mid infrared attenuation coefficient.
Specific parameters such as dispersion and single oscillator energy, Abbe
number, and first-/ third-order optical susceptibility are enclosed together
with the values of magneto-optic anomaly derived from the calculation of
measured dispersion of the refractive index.

Room-temperature superconductivity has always been regarded as the ultimate
goal in the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, with its
realization holding revolutionary significance, capable of triggering
significant changes in energy transmission and storage. However, achieving it
poses various challenges. Recent research revealed that material
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O displays room-temperature superconductivity
under atmospheric pressure, sparking global interest in further exploration.
Here, we utilized solid-phase synthesis to obtain a polycrystalline sample of
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O. X-ray diffraction confirmed its structural
consistency with referenced literature. Zero resistance, which is important
evidence for superconductivity, was observed above 100$^\circ$ K under ambient
pressure in our experiment. Our finding indicates that
Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a possible candidate for searching
high-temperature superconductors.

Quantum oscillation (QO), a physical phenomenon that reflects the
characteristics of the Fermi surface and transport fermions, has been
extensively observed in metals and semimetals through various approaches, like
magnetostriction, magnetization, resistivity, and thermoelectric power.
However, only some allowed oscillation frequencies can be revealed by each
individual method, particularly in semimetals with intricate Fermi pockets and
associated magnetic breakdown phenomena. In this paper, we present the
application of an ac composite magnetoelectric (ME) technique to measure the
QOs of a topological nodal-line semimetal, ZrSiS, which possesses six
fundamental QO frequencies. By employing the ME technique with a maximum
magnetic field of 13 T and a minimum temperature of 2 K, we are able to capture
all the fundamental frequencies and most of the permissible magnetic breakdown
frequencies. In comparison, some of the frequencies were missing in the
aforementioned four methods under identical measurement conditions. Remarkably,
a series of magnetic breakdown frequencies around 8000 T were revealed even in
a magnetic field as low as 7.5 T. These findings highlight the ME technique as
an ultrahigh-sensitive tool for studying Dirac Fermions and other topological
semimetals with complex Fermi surfaces.

Here we study the effect of electron doping the kagome superconductor
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Single crystals and powders of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Te$_x$ are
synthesized and characterized via magnetic susceptibility, nuclear quadrupole
resonance, and x-ray diffraction measurements, where we observe a slight
suppression of the charge density wave transition temperature and
superconducting temperature with the introduction of electron dopants. In
contrast to hole-doping, both transitions survive relatively unperturbed up to
the solubility limit of Te within the lattice. A comparison is presented
between the electronic phase diagrams of electron- and hole-tuned
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

We present a new approach to studying nanoparticle collisions using Density
Functional based Tight Binding (DFTB). A novel DFTB parameterisation has been
developed to study the collision process of Sn and Si nanoparticles (NPs) using
Molecular Dynamics (MD). While bulk structures were used as training sets, we
show that our model is able to accurately reproduce the cohesive energy of the
nanoparticles using Density Functional Theory (DFT) as a reference. A
surprising variety of phenomena are revealed for the Si/Sn nanoparticle
collisions, depending on the size and velocity of the collision: from
core-shell structure formation to bounce-off phenomena.

<h3>Cruciform specimens biaxial extension performance relationship to  constitutive identification</h3>

Main desired features of biaxial tests are: uniformity of stresses and
strains; high strain levels in gauge areas; reliable constitutive parameters
identification. Despite cruciform specimen suitability to modern tensile
devices, standard testing techniques are still debated because of difficulties
in matching these demands. This work aims at providing rational performance
objectives and efficient cruciform specimens shapes in view of constitutive
parameter fitting. Objective performance is evaluated along particular lines
lying on principal directions in equibiaxial tensile tests. A rich specimen
profile geometry is purposely optimized in silico by varying cost function and
material compressibility. Experimental tests, monitored via digital image
correlation, are carried out for validation. New shapes are designed and tested
in a biaxial tensile apparatus and show to perform better than existing ones.
Parameter fitting is efficiently performed by only exploiting full field strain
measurements along lines. Small gauge areas and small fillet radii cruciform
specimens get closer to the ideal behavior. For constitutive parameters
identification in two-dimensional tensile experiments, data analysis on gauge
lines deformation suffices.

<h3>First Passage Time for Many Particle Diffusion in Space-Time Random  Environments</h3>

<br>

The first passage time for a single diffusing particle has been studied
extensively, but the first passage time of a system of many diffusing
particles, as is often the case in physical systems, has received little
attention until recently. We consider two models for many particle diffusion --
one treats each particle as independent simple random walkers while the other
treats them as coupled to a common space-time random forcing field that biases
particles nearby in space and time in similar ways. The first passage time of a
single diffusing particle under both of these models show the same statistics
and scaling behavior. However, for many particle diffusions, the first passage
time among all particles (the `extreme first passage time') is very different
between the two models, effected in the latter case by the randomness of the
common forcing field. We develop an asymptotic (in the number of particles and
location where first passage is being probed) theoretical framework to separate
out the impact of the random environment with that of sampling trajectories
within it. We identify a new power-law describing the impact to the extreme
first passage time variance of the environment. Through numerical simulations
we verify that the predictions from this asymptotic theory hold even for
systems with widely varying numbers of particles, all the way down to 100
particles. This shows that measurements of the extreme first passage time for
many-particle diffusions provide an indirect measurement of the underlying
environment in which the diffusion is occurring.

<h3>Unified Entropy-Ruled Einstein Relation for Bulk and Low-Dimensional  Systems: A Hopping to Band Shift Analysis</h3>

In this letter, we present the unified paradigm on entropy-ruled Einstein
diffusion-mobility relation ({\mu}/D ratio) for all dimensional systems (1D, 2D
and 3D) of molecules and materials. The different dimension-associated
fractional value of the variation in differential entropy with respect to the
chemical potential ({\Delta}h/{\Delta}{\eta}) gives the quantum-classical
transition version of {\mu}/D relation. This is a new alternative version for
quantum devices, instead of Einstein original relation of {\mu}/D = q/kT; where
q, k and T are the electric charge, Boltzmann constant and temperature,
respectively. It is found that the fractional value of {\Delta}h/{\Delta}{\eta}
for {\mu}/D ratio for different dimensional systems or devices is a direct
consequences with the average energy-Fermi energy relation, which can varies
with the typical dimensions, whether the system belongs to 1D or 2D or 3D. This
unified entropy-ruled transport formalism works well for both the quantum and
classical systems with equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium conditions. Based
on the dimensional dependent entropy-ruled {\mu}/D factor, the
Navamani-Shockley diode equation is transformed.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an incredibly diverse group of highly
porous hybrid materials, which are interesting for a wide range of possible
applications. For a reliable description of many of their properties accurate
computationally highly efficient methods, like force-field potentials (FFPs),
are required. With the advent of machine learning approaches, it is now
possible to generate such potentials with relatively little human effort. Here,
we present a recipe to parametrize two fundamentally different types of
exceptionally accurate and computationally highly efficient machine learned
potentials, which belong to the moment-tensor and kernel-based potential
families. They are parametrized relying on reference configurations generated
in the course of molecular dynamics based, active learning runs and their
performance is benchmarked for a representative selection of commonly studied
MOFs. For both potentials, comparison to a random set of validation structures
reveals close to DFT precision in predicted forces and structural parameters of
all MOFs. Essentially the same applies to elastic constants and phonon band
structures. Additionally, for MOF-5 the thermal conductivity is obtained with
full quantitative agreement to single-crystal experiments. All this is possible
while maintaining a high degree of computational efficiency, with the obtained
machine learned potentials being only moderately slower than the extremely
simple UFF4MOF or Dreiding force fields. The exceptional accuracy of the
presented FFPs combined with their computational efficiency has the potential
of lifting the computational modelling of MOFs to the next level.

In the magnetic kagome metal FeGe, a charge density wave (CDW) order emerges
inside the antiferromagnetic phase, providing a fertile playground to
investigate the interplay between charge and magnetic orders. Here, we
demonstrate that the CDW order, as well as magnetic properties, can be
reversibly tuned on a large scale through post-growth annealing treatments. The
antiferromagnetic and CDW transitions vary systematically as functions of both
the temperature and the time period of annealing. Long-range CDW order with a
maximum $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$ and a minimum $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ can be realized in
crystals annealed at \SI{320}{\degreeCelsius} for over 48 h. Using
magnetization and magnetostrictive coefficient measurements, it is found that
the CDW transition is rather stable against an external magnetic field and
spin-flop transition. On the other hand, the critical field for spin-flop
transition is significantly reduced in the long-range ordered CDW phase. Our
results indicate that the CDW in FeGe is immune to variations in magnetic
orders, while the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the corresponding
magnetic ground state can be altered significantly by the charge order. These
findings provide crucial clues for further investigation and a better
understanding of the nature of the CDW order in FeGe.

A hypothetical non-dimerized Cu chain in equilibrium is a spin-\half atom
Mott insulator (AMI), eventhough its band width is high ~ 10 eV. This RVB
reservoir has a large exchange coupling J ~ 2 eV. This idea of, \textit{broad
band Mott localization} was used by us in our earlier works, including
prediction of high Tc superconductivity in doped graphene, silicene and a
theory for hot superconductivity reported in Ag-Au nanostructures (TP 2008). In
the present work we identify possible random AMI subsystems in Cu-Pb Apatite
and develop a model for reported hot superconductivity (LKK 2023). In apatite
structure, network of interstitial columnar spaces run parallel to c-axis and
ab-plane. They accomodate excess copper, as neutral Cu atom clusters, chains
and planar segments. They are our emergent AMI's. Electron transfer from AMI's
to insulating host, generates strong local superconducting correlation, via
phyics of doped Mott insulator. Josephson coupling between doped AMI's,
establishes hot superconductivity. A major Challenge to superconducting order
in real material is competing insulating phases - valence bond solid
(spin-Peirels)-lattice distortions etc. AMI theory points to ways of making the
\textit{elusive superconductivity} palpable. We recommend exploration of hot
superconductivity in the rich world of minerals and insulators, via metal atom
inclusion.
