Conserved-charge densities are very special observables in quantum many-body
systems as, by construction, they encode information about the dynamics.
Therefore, their evolution is expected to be of much simpler interpretation
than that of generic observables and to return universal information on the
state of the system at any given time. Here we study the dynamics of the
fluctuations of conserved U (1) charges in systems that are prepared in
charge-asymmetric initial states. We characterise the charge fluctuations in a
given subsystem using the full-counting statistics of the truncated charge and
the quantum entanglement between the subsystem and the rest resolved to the
symmetry sectors of the charge. We show that, even though the initial states
considered are homogeneous in space, the charge fluctuations generate an
effective inhomogeneity due to the charge-asymmetric nature of the initial
states. We use this observation to map the problem into that of charge
fluctuations on inhomogeneous, charge-symmetric states and treat it using a
recently developed space-time duality approach. Specialising the treatment to
interacting integrable systems we combine the space-time duality approach with
generalised hydrodynamics to find explicit predictions.

<h3>Quantum Fractality on the Surface of Topological Insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11793" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11793</a>

Three-dimensional topological insulators support gapless Dirac fermion
surface states whose rich topological properties result from the interplay of
symmetries and dimensionality. Their topological properties have been
extensively studied in systems of integer spatial dimension but the prospect of
these surface electrons arranging into structures of non-integer dimension like
fractals remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a new class of states
arising from the coupling of surface Dirac fermions to a time-reversal
symmetric fractal potential, which breaks translation symmetry while retaining
self-similarity. Employing large-scale exact diagonalization, scaling analysis
of the inverse participation ratio, and the box-counting method, we establish
the onset of self-similar Dirac fermions with fractal dimension for a
symmetry-preserving surface potential with the geometry of a Sierpinski carpet
fractal with fractal dimension $D \approx 1.89$. Dirac fractal surface states
open a fruitful avenue to explore exotic regimes of transport and quantum
information storage in topological systems with fractal dimensionality.

<h3>Observation of microscopic confinement dynamics by a tunable topological  $θ$-angle</h3>

The topological $\theta$-angle is central to the understanding of a plethora
of phenomena in condensed matter and high-energy physics such as the strong CP
problem, dynamical quantum topological phase transitions, and the
confinement--deconfinement transition. Difficulties arise when probing the
effects of the topological $\theta$-angle using classical methods, in
particular through the appearance of a sign problem in numerical simulations.
Quantum simulators offer a powerful alternate venue for realizing the
$\theta$-angle, which has hitherto remained an outstanding challenge due to the
difficulty of introducing a dynamical electric field in the experiment. Here,
we report on the experimental realization of a tunable topological
$\theta$-angle in a Bose--Hubbard gauge-theory quantum simulator, implemented
through a tilted superlattice potential that induces an effective background
electric field. We demonstrate the rich physics due to this angle by the direct
observation of the confinement--deconfinement transition of $(1+1)$-dimensional
quantum electrodynamics. Using an atomic-precision quantum gas microscope, we
distinguish between the confined and deconfined phases by monitoring the
real-time evolution of particle--antiparticle pairs, which exhibit constrained
(ballistic) propagation for a finite (vanishing) deviation of the
$\theta$-angle from $\pi$. Our work provides a major step forward in the
realization of topological terms on modern quantum simulators, and the
exploration of rich physics they have been theorized to entail.

<h3>Single-quasiparticle eigenstate thermalization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11829" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11829</a>

Quadratic Hamiltonians that exhibit single-particle quantum chaos are named
quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians. One of their hallmarks is
single-particle eigenstate thermalization introduced in Phys. Rev. B 104,
214203 (2021), which describes statistical properties of matrix elements of
observables in single-particle eigenstates. However, the latter has been
studied only in quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians that obey the U(1)
symmetry. Here, we focus on quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians that break
the U(1) symmetry and hence their "single-particle" eigenstates are actually
single-quasiparticle excitations introduced on top of a many-body state. We
study the structure of their wave functions and matrix elements of one-body
observables, for which we introduce the notion of single-quasiparticle
eigenstate thermalization. Focusing on spinless fermion Hamiltonians in three
dimensions with local hopping, pairing and on-site disorder, we also study the
properties of disorder-induced near zero modes, which give rise to a sharp peak
in the density of states at zero energy. Finally, we numerically show
equilibration of observables in many-body eigenstates after a quantum quench.
We prove that it is a consequence of single-quasiparticle eigenstate
thermalization, in analogy to the U(1) symmetric case from arXiv:2210.00016.

Synthesis of high-performance single crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) in
the absence of molten salt is challenging with no success yet. An innovative
drop-in approach is discovered to synthesize single crystal NMC811 by
controlling the morphology of transition metal hydroxide TM(OH)2 precursors
followed by a simple decomposition step to form transition metal oxide (TMO)
intermediates. Ni redistribution in TMO, as a result of the concurrent
formation of mixed spinel and rock salt phases, helps deagglomerate the later
formed NMC811 clusters of single crystals. As-prepared single crystal NMC811 is
validated in a 2Ah pouch cell demonstrating 1000 stable cycling. The
fundamentally new reaction mechanism of single crystal growth and segregation
without molten salt provides a new direction towards cost-efficient
manufacturing of single crystal NMC811 cathode for advanced lithium-based
batteries.

<h3>Convolutional neural networks for large-scale dynamical modeling of  itinerant magnets</h3>

Complex spin textures in itinerant electron magnets hold promises for
next-generation memory and information technology. The long-ranged and often
frustrated electron-mediated spin interactions in these materials give rise to
intriguing localized spin structures such as skyrmions. Yet, simulations of
magnetization dynamics for such itinerant magnets are computationally difficult
due to the need for repeated solutions to the electronic structure problems. We
present a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately and
efficiently predict the electron-induced magnetic torques acting on local
spins. Importantly, as the convolutional operations with a fixed kernel
(receptive field) size naturally take advantage of the locality principle for
many-electron systems, CNN offers a scalable machine learning approach to spin
dynamics. We apply our approach to enable large-scale dynamical simulations of
skyrmion phases in itinerant spin systems. By incorporating the CNN model into
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics, our simulations successfully reproduce the
relaxation process of the skyrmion phase and stabilize a skyrmion lattice in
larger systems. The CNN model also allows us to compute the effective receptive
fields, thus providing a systematic and unbiased method for determining the
locality of the original electron models.

Neural networks are promising tools for high-throughput and accurate
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of nanomaterials, but are known
to generalize poorly on data that is "out-of-distribution" from their training
data. Given the limited set of image features typically seen in high-resolution
TEM imaging, it is unclear which images are considered out-of-distribution from
others. Here, we investigate how the choice of metadata features in the
training dataset influences neural network performance, focusing on the example
task of nanoparticle segmentation. We train and validate neural networks across
curated, experimentally-collected high-resolution TEM image datasets of
nanoparticles under controlled imaging and material parameters, including
magnification, dosage, nanoparticle diameter, and nanoparticle material.
Overall, we find that our neural networks are not robust across microscope
parameters, but do generalize across certain sample parameters. Additionally,
data preprocessing heavily influences the generalizability of neural networks
trained on nominally similar datasets. Our results highlight the need to
understand how dataset features affect deployment of data-driven algorithms.

<h3>Erbium-excess gallium garnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
A series of garnets of formula Er3+xGa5-xO12 is described, for which we
report the crystal structures for both polycrystalline and single-crystal
samples. The x limit in the garnet phase is between 0.5 and 0.6 under our
conditions, with the Er fully occupying the normal garnet site plus
half-occupying the octahedral site at x = 0.5 in place of the Ga normally
present. Long-range antiferromagnetic order with spin ice-like frustration is
suggested by the transition temperature (TN=0.8K) being much lower than the
Curie-Weiss theta. The magnetic ordering temperature does not depend on the Er
excess, but there is increasing residual entropy as the Er excess is increased,
highlighting the potential for unusual magnetic behavior in this system.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the effects of ellipticity-induced curvature on atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates confined in quasi-one-dimensional closed-loop
waveguides. Our theoretical study reveals intriguing phenomena arising from the
interplay between curvature and interactions. Density modulations are observed
in regions of high curvature, but these modulations are suppressed by strong
repulsive interactions. Additionally, we observe phase accumulation in regions
with the lowest curvature when the waveguide with persistent current is
squeezed. Furthermore, waveguides hosting persistent currents exhibit dynamic
transformations between states with different angular momenta. These findings
provide insights into the behavior of atomic condensates in curved waveguides,
with implications for fundamental physics and quantum technologies. The
interplay between curvature and interactions offers opportunities for exploring
novel quantum phenomena and engineering quantum states in confined geometries.

<h3>A DFT Study on the Mechanical, Electronic, Thermodynamic, and Optical  Properties of GaN and AlN Counterparts of Biphenylene Network</h3>

<br>
<br>
The biphenylene network (BPN) is a notable achievement in recent fabrication
endeavors for conceiving new 2D materials. The stability of its boron nitride
counterpart, BN-BPN, has been confirmed through numerical investigations. In
this study, we conducted a density functional theory (DFT) analysis to examine
the mechanical, electronic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of two other
group-III counterparts of BPN: gallium nitride (BPN-GaN) and aluminum nitride
(BPN-AlN). Our findings reveal that the band gap values for BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN
are 2.3 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively, at the HSE06 level. At the GGA/PBE level,
we found band gap values of 1.8 eV and 2.3 eV for BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN,
respectively. Phonon calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations suggest that BPN-AlN has good structural and dynamic stabilities.
On the other hand, BPN-GaN displayed negative phonon frequencies, suggesting
potential instability. Nevertheless, results from AIMD simulations point to its
structural integrity with no bond reconstructions at 1000 K. These materials
exhibit noteworthy UV activity, presenting promising prospects as UV
collectors. The thermodynamic properties reveal that the heat capacity of both
BPN-AlN and BPN-GaN increases with temperature, eventually reaching the
Dulong-Petit limit at around 800 K. We also performed calculations to determine
the elastic stiffness constants, Young's modulus, and Poisson ratio for both
BPN-GaN and BPN-AlN, providing valuable insights into their mechanical
properties.

<h3>Quantum critical fans from critical lines at zero temperature</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum critical phenomena influences the finite temperature behavior of
condensed matter systems through quantum critical fans whose extents are
determined by the exponents of the zero temperature criticality. Here we
emphasize the aspects of quantum critical lines, as discussed previously, and
study an exactly solved model involving a transverse field Ising model with
added three-spin interaction. This model has three critical lines. We compute
the spin-spin correlation function and extract the correlation length, and
identify the crossovers: quantum critical to quantum disordered, or
renormalized classical regimes. We construct the quantum critical fans along
one of the critical lines. In addition, we also construct finite temperature
dynamic structure factors. We hope this model will become experimentally
realizable in the future, and our results could stimulate studies in many
similar models.

<h3>Raman Study of Layered Breathing Kagome Lattice Semiconductor Nb3Cl8</h3>

<br>
<br>
Niobium chloride (Nb3Cl8) is a layered 2D semiconducting material with many
exotic properties including a breathing kagome lattice, a topological flat band
in its band structure, and a crystal structure that undergoes a structural and
magnetic phase transition at temperatures below 90 K. Despite being a
remarkable material with fascinating new physics, the understanding of its
phononic properties is at its infancy. In this study, we investigate the phonon
dynamics of Nb3Cl8 in bulk and few layer flakes using polarized Raman
spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) analysis to determine the
material's vibrational modes, as well as their symmetrical representations and
atomic displacements. We experimentally resolved 12 phonon modes, 5 of which
are A1g modes the remaining 7 are Eg modes, which is in strong agreement with
our DFT calculation. Layer-dependent results suggest that the Raman peak
positions are mostly insensitive to changes in layer thickness, while peak
intensity and FWHM are affected. Raman measurements as a function of excitation
wavelength (473, 532, 633, 785 nm) show a significant increase of the peak
intensities when using a 473 nm excitation source, suggesting a near resonant
condition. Low-temperature Raman measurements carried out at 7.6 K did not show
any changes in the phonon modes and their symmetries, suggesting that the
observed Raman modes may not be sensitive to the structural phase transition.
Magneto-Raman measurements carried out at 140 and 2 K between -2 to 2 T show
that Raman modes are not magnetically coupled. Overall, the study presented
here significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the layered
material Nb3Cl8 which can be further exploited for future applications.

<h3>A Unified Understanding of Minimum Lattice Thermal Conductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11917" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11917</a>
<br>
<i>Yi Xia, Dale Gaines II, Jiangang He, Koushik Pal, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis, Vidvuds Ozolins, Chris Wolverton</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a first-principles model of minimum lattice thermal conductivity
($\kappa_{\rm L}^{\rm min}$) based on a unified theoretical treatment of
thermal transport in crystals and glasses. We apply this model to thousands of
inorganic compounds and discover a universal behavior of $\kappa_{\rm L}^{\rm
min}$ in crystals in the high-temperature limit: the isotropically averaged
$\kappa_{\rm L}^{\rm min}$ is independent of structural complexity and bounded
within a range from $\sim$0.1 to $\sim$2.6 W/[m$\cdot$K], in striking contrast
to the conventional phonon gas model which predicts no lower bound. We unveil
the underlying physics by showing that for a given parent compound $\kappa_{\rm
L}^{\rm min}$ is bounded from below by a value that is approximately
insensitive to disorder, but the relative importance of different heat
transport channels (phonon gas versus diffuson) depends strongly on the degree
of disorder. Moreover, we propose that the diffuson-dominated $\kappa_{\rm
L}^{\rm min}$ in complex and disordered compounds might be effectively
approximated by the phonon gas model for an ordered compound by averaging out
disorder and applying phonon unfolding. With these insights, we further bridge
the knowledge gap between our model and the well-known Cahill-Watson-Pohl (CWP)
model, rationalizing the successes and limitations of the CWP model in the
absence of heat transfer mediated by diffusons. Finally, we construct graph
network and random forest machine learning models to extend our predictions to
all compounds within the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), which
were validated against thermoelectric materials possessing experimentally
measured ultralow $\kappa_{\rm L}$. Our work offers a unified understanding of
$\kappa_{\rm L}^{\rm min}$, which can guide the rational engineering of
materials to achieve $\kappa_{\rm L}^{\rm min}$.

<h3>Replica-symmetry breaking transitions in the large deviations of the  ground-state of a spherical spin-glass</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11927" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11927</a>
<br>
<i>Bertrand Lacroix-A-Chez-Toine, Yan V. Fyodorov, Pierre Le Doussal</i>
<br>
<br>
We derive, within the replica formalism, a generalisation of the
Crisanti-Sommers formula to describe the large deviation function (LDF) ${\cal
L}(e)$ for the speed-$N$ atypical fluctuations of the intensive ground-state
energy $e$ of a generic spherical spin-glass in the presence of a random
external magnetic field of variance $\Gamma$. We then analyse our exact formula
for the LDF in much detail for the Replica symmetric, single step Replica
Symmetry Breaking (1-RSB) and Full Replica Symmetry Breaking (FRSB) situations.
Our main qualitative conclusion is that the level of RSB governing the LDF may
be different from that for the typical ground state. We find that while the
deepest ground-states are always controlled by a LDF of replica symmetric form,
beyond a finite threshold $e\geq e_{t}$ a replica-symmetry breaking starts to
be operative. These findings resolve the puzzling discrepancy between our
earlier replica calculations for the $p=2$ spherical spin-glass and the
rigorous results by Dembo and Zeitouni which we are able to reproduce invoking
an 1-RSB pattern. Finally at an even larger critical energy $e_{c}\geq e_{t}$,
acting as a "wall", the LDF diverges logarithmically, which we interpret as a
change in the large deviation speed from $N$ to a faster growth. In addition,
we show that in the limit $\Gamma \to 0$ the LDF takes non-trivial scaling
forms (i) ${\cal L}(e) \sim G((e-e_c)/\Gamma)$ in the vicinity of the wall (ii)
${\cal L}(e) \sim \Gamma^{\eta \nu} F((e-e_{\rm typ})/\Gamma^{\nu})$ in the
vicinity of the typical energy, characterised by two new exponents $\eta\geq 1$
and $\nu$ characterising universality classes. Via matching the latter allows
us to formulate several conjectures concerning the regime of {\it typical
fluctuations}, identified as $e-e_{\rm typ} \sim N^{-1/\eta}$ and $\Gamma \sim
N^{-1/(\eta \nu)}$.

Semiconducting diode with nonreciprocal transport effect underlies the
cornerstone of contemporary integrated circuits (ICs) technology. Due to
isotropic superconducting properties and the lack of breaking of inversion
symmetry for conventional s-wave superconductors, such a superconducting peer
is absent. Recently, a series of superconducting structures, including
superconducting superlattice and quantum-material-based superconducting
Josephson junction, have exhibited a superconducting diode effect in terms of
polarity-dependent critical current. However, due to complex structures, these
composite systems are not able to construct large-scale integrated
superconducting circuits. Here, we demonstrated the minimal superconducting
electric component-superconducting nanowire-based diode with a nonreciprocal
transport effect under a perpendicular magnetic field, in which the
superconducting to normal metallic phase transition relies on the polarity and
amplitude of the bias current. Our nanowire diodes can be reliably operated
nearly at all temperatures below the critical temperature, and the
rectification efficiency at 2 K can be more than 24%. Moreover, the
superconducting nanowire diode is able to rectify both square wave and sine
wave signals without any distortion. Combining the superconducting
nanowire-based diodes and transistors, superconducting nanowires hold the
possibility to construct novel low-dissipation superconducting ICs.

<h3>First-principles prediction of structural, magnetic properties of  Cr-substituted strontium hexaferrite, and its site preference</h3>

<br>
<br>
To investigate the structural and magnetic properties of Cr-doped M-type
strontium hexaferrite (SrFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$) with x = (0.0, 0.5, 1.0), we
perform first-principles total-energy calculations relied on density functional
theory. Based on the calculation of the substitution energy of Cr in strontium
hexaferrite and formation probability analysis, we conclude that the doped Cr
atoms prefer to occupy the 2a, 12k, and 4f$_{2}$ sites which is in good
agreement with the experimental findings. Due to Cr$^{3+}$ ion moment, 3
{$\mu_B$}, smaller than that of Fe$^{3+}$ ion, 5 {$\mu_B$}, saturation
magnetization (M$_{s}$) reduce rapidly as the concentration of Cr increases in
strontium hexaferrite. The magnetic anisotropic field $\left(H_{a}\right)$
rises with an increasing fraction of Cr despite a significant reduction of
magnetization and a slight increase of magnetocrystalline anisotropy
$\left(K_{1}\right)$.The cause for the rise in magnetic anisotropy field
$\left(H_{a}\right)$ with an increasing fraction of Cr is further emphasized by
our formation probability study. Cr$^{3+}$ ions prefer to occupy the 2a sites
at lower temperatures, but as the temperature rises, it is more likely that
they will occupy the 12k site. Cr$^{3+}$ ions are more likely to occupy the 12k
site than the 2a site at a specific annealing temperature (>700{\deg}C).

<h3>An Analytical Model to Quantify the Local Lattice Distortion of  Refractory High Entropy Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11959" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11959</a>

<br>
<br>
Local lattice distortion (LLD) of high entropy alloys (HEAs) especially
refractory HEAs, which is different from one lattice site to another,
determines the mechanical properties of HEAs such as yield strength and
radiation resistance, and is crucial to modulating catalytic activity of HEAs
via the atomic strain. In particular, this site-to-site LLD is strongly coupled
with the short-range order (SRO) of HEAs. Therefore it is essential to reveal
the physical picture of LLD. However, the random distribution of
multi-principal constituents of HEAs prohibits the understanding of LLD,
including the determinants of LLD and their coupling rules. Herein, we build
the first analytical model to realize the site-to-site prediction of LLD in
refractory HEAs, by using the neighbor number ratio of central atoms, the
central-atom radii, the standard deviation of constituent radii and the
constituent number, which demonstrates that LLD surprisingly exhibits a similar
mechanism as the relaxation of metal surfaces. The involved parameters depend
only on the radii of constituents and are readily accessible. Moreover, our
scheme determines not only LLD but also the average lattice distortion, which
enables us to predict the phase stability and yield strength of HEAs. These
results build a novel physical picture of LLD, in particular the quantitative
relationship between LLD and SRO, which lay a solid foundation for the further
target-oriented design of HEAs.

<h3>Effective Medium Theory for Mechanical Phase Transitions of Fiber  Networks</h3>

Networks of stiff polymers govern the elasticity of biological structures
such as the extracellular matrix of collagen. These networks are known to
stiffen nonlinearly under shear or extensional strain. Recently, it has been
shown that such stiffening is governed by a strain-controlled athermal but
critical phase transition, from a floppy phase at small strain to a rigid phase
at large strain. While this phase transition has been extensively studied
numerically and experimentally, an analytical understanding of this transition
remains elusive. Here, we present an effective medium theory (EMT) for this
mechanical phase transition of fiber networks. We extend a previous EMT on
linear elasticity to incorporate nonlinear effects via an anharmonic
Hamiltonian. The mean-field predictions of this theory, including the critical
exponents, scaling relations and non-affine fluctuations qualitatively agree
with previous experimental and numerical results.

This work presents a machine learning approach to predict novel perovskite
oxide materials in the Pr-Al-O and Pr-Sc-O compound families with the potential
for photoluminescence applications. The predicted materials exhibit a large
bandgap and high Debye temperature, and have remained unexplored thus far. The
predicted compounds (Pr$_3$AlO$_6$, Pr$_4$Al$_2$O$_9$, Pr$_3$ScO$_6$ and
Pr$_3$Sc$_5$O$_{12}$) are screened using machine learning approach, which are
then confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The study includes
the calculation of the bandgap and density of states to determine electronic
properties, and the optical absorption and emission spectra to determine
optical properties. Mechanical stability of the predicted compounds, as
demonstrated by satisfying the Born-Huang criterion. By combining machine
learning and density functional theory, this work offers a more efficient and

<h3>Emergent super-antiferromagnetic correlations in monolayers of Fe3O4  nanoparticles throughout the superparamagnetic blocking transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report nanoscale inter-particle magnetic orderings in self-assemblies of
Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs), and the emergence of inter-particle
antiferromagnetic (AF) (super-antiferromagnetic) correlations near the coercive
field at low temperature. The magnetic ordering is probed via x-ray resonant
magnetic scattering (XRMS), with the x-ray energy tuned to the Fe-L3 edge and
using circular polarized light. By exploiting dichroic effects, a magnetic
scattering signal is isolated from the charge scattering signal. The magnetic
signal informs about nanoscale spatial orderings at various stages throughout
the magnetization process and at various temperatures throughout the
superparamagnetic blocking transition, for two different sizes of NPs, 5 and 11
nm, with blocking temperatures TB of 28 K and 170 K, respectively. At 300 K,
while the magnetometry data essentially shows superparamagnetism and absence of
hysteresis for both particle sizes, the XRMS data reveals the presence of
non-zero (up to 9/100) inter-particle AF couplings when the applied field is
released to zero for the 11 nm NPs. These AF couplings are drastically
amplified when the NPs are cooled down below TB and reach up to 12/100 for the
5 nm NPs and 48/100 for the 11 nm NPs, near the coercive point. The data
suggests that the particle size affects the prevalence of the AF couplings:
compared to ferromagnetic (F) couplings, the relative prevalence of AF
couplings at the coercive point increases from a factor ~ 1.6 to 3.8 when the
NP size increases from 5 to 11 nm.

<h3>Microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy of  exciton-polarons in one-dimensional materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11998" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11998</a>
<br>
<i>Jia Wang, Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
We have developed a microscopic many-body theory of two-dimensional coherent
spectroscopy (2DCS) for a model of polarons in one-dimensional (1D) materials.
Our theory accounts for contributions from all three processes: excited-state
emission (ESE), ground-state bleaching (GSB), and excited-state absorption
(ESA). While the ESE and GSB contributions can be accurately described using a
Chevy's ansatz with one particle-hole excitation, the ESA process requires
information about the many-body eigenstates involving two impurities. To
calculate these double polaron states, we have extended the Chevy's ansatz with
one particle-hole excitation. The validity of this ansatz was verified by
comparing our results with an exact calculation using Bethe's ansatz. Our
numerical results reveal that in the weak interaction limit, the ESA
contribution cancels out the total ESE and GSB contributions, resulting in less
significant spectral features. However, for strong interactions, the features
of the ESA contribution and the combined ESE and GSB contributions remain
observable in the 2DCS spectra. These features provide valuable information
about the interactions between polarons. Additionally, we have investigated the
mixing time dynamics, which characterize the quantum coherences of the polaron
resonances. Overall, our theory provides a comprehensive framework for
understanding and interpreting the 2DCS spectra of polarons in 1D materials,
shedding light on their interactions and coherent dynamics.

<br>
<br>
The performance of semiconductor devices can be enhanced by understanding and
characterizing the bound states of deep defects. However, simulating these
states using conventional $\textit{ab initio}$ techniques, which are limited by
small cell volumes, proves challenging due to their extended nature spanning
tens of nanometers. Here, we present a semi-$\textit{ab initio}$ method for
modeling the bound states of deep defects in semiconductors, applied to the
negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) center in diamond. We employ
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct accurate potentials
for an effective mass model and allowing us to unveil the structure of the
bound hole states. We also develop a model to calculate the non-radiative
capture cross-sections, which agrees with experiment within one order of
magnitude. Finally, we present the first attempt at constructing the
photoionization spectrum of NV$^0\rightarrow$ NV$^-$ + bound hole, showing that
the electronic transitions of the bound holes can be distinguished from phonon
sidebands. This approach can be adapted to other deep defects in
semiconductors.

<br>
<br>
The classical $J_1-J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice is a minimal model
of frustrated magnetism whose phase boundaries are not yet completely
understood. We use adiabatic evolution of tensor networks directly in the
thermodynamic limit to compute Helmholtz free energy density crossings, order
parameter discontinuities, and correlation lengths. We combine this data with
theoretical arguments to show that the phase boundary at $0.5\lesssim J_2/|J_1|
< \infty$ is weak first-order such that it asymptotically becomes second-order
when $J_2/|J_1|\rightarrow\infty$. We also find signs of a novel type of
first-order phase transition when $J_2/|J_1|\rightarrow 0.5^+$.

<h3>Non-Hermitian band theory in all dimensions: uniform spectra and skin  effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12022" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12022</a>
<br>
<i>Haiping Hu</i>
<br>
<br>
The non-Hermitian skin effect is an iconic phenomenon, characterized by the
aggregation of eigenstates near the system boundaries in non-Hermitian systems.
While extensively studied in one dimension, understanding the skin effect and
extending the non-Bloch band theory to higher dimensions poses a formidable
challenge, primarily due to infinite lattice geometries or open boundary
conditions. This work adopts a point-gap perspective and presents a unified
non-Hermitian band theory that governs skin effects across all spatial
dimensions. We introduce the concept of uniform spectra and reveal that
regardless of lattice geometry, their energy spectra are uniformly given by the
uniform spectra, even though their manifestations of skin modes may differ.
Building on the uniform spectra, we demonstrate how to account for the skin
effect in generic lattice cuts and establish the connections of skin modes
across different geometric shapes via momentum-basis transformations. Our
findings highlight the pivotal roles played by point gaps, offering a unified
understanding of the non-Hermitian skin effect in all dimensions.

<br>
<br>
We report the effect of electron-beam patterning on the water uptake and
ionic conductivity of Nafion films using a combination of x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance studies, neutron reflectometry, and
AC impedance spectroscopy. The aim was to more fully characterize the nature of
the nanoscale patterned Nafion structures recently used as a key element in
novel ion-to-electron transducers by Gluschke et al. To enable these studies,
we develop the electron beam patterning process for large areas, achieving
patterning speeds approaching 1 cm$^{2}$/hr, and patterned areas as large as 7
cm$^{2}$ for the neutron reflectometry studies. We ultimately show that
electron-beam patterning affects both the water uptake and the ionic
conductivity, depending on film thickness. We see Type-II adsorption isotherm
behaviour for all films. For thick films (~230 nm), we see a strong reduction
in water uptake with electron-beam patterning. In contrast, for thin films (~30
nm), electron-beam patterning enhances water uptake. Notably, we find that for
either thickness the reduction in ionic conductivity arising from electron-beam
patterning is kept to less than an order of magnitude. We propose mechanisms
for the observed behaviour based on the known complex morphology of Nafion
films to motivate future studies of electron-beam processed Nafion.

<h3>Quantum spin liquids on the diamond lattice</h3>

<br>
<br>
We perform a projective symmetry group classification of spin $S=1/2$
symmetric quantum spin liquids with different gauge groups on the diamond
lattice. Employing the Abrikosov fermion representation, we obtain $8$ $SU(2)$,
$62$ $U(1)$ and $80$ $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebraic PSGs. Constraining these
solutions to mean-field parton Ans\"atze with short-range amplitudes, the
classification reduces to only $2$ $SU(2)$, $7$ $U(1)$ and $8$ $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
distinctly realizable phases. We obtain both the singlet and triplet fields for
all Ans\"atze, discuss the spinon dispersions and present the dynamical spin
structure factors within a self-consistent treatment of the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian with up to third-nearest neighbor couplings. Interestingly, we find
that a zero-flux $SU(2)$ state and some descendent $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
states host robust gapless nodal loops in their dispersion spectrum, owing
their stability at the mean-field level to the projective implementation of
rotoinversion and screw symmetries. A nontrivial connection is drawn between
one of our $U(1)$ spinon Hamiltonians (belonging to the nonprojective class)
and the Fu-Kane-Mele model for a three-dimensional topological insulator on the
diamond lattice. We show that Gutzwiller projection of the 0- and $\pi$-flux
$SU(2)$ spin liquids generates long-range N\'eel order.

<br>
<br>
We report a study on the growth of NiBi3 nanowires and nanorods during the
preparation of superconducting NiBi3 films by co-evaporation of Ni and Bi. We
find that NiBi3 films grown via co-evaporation of Ni and Bi metals achieve
higher transition temperatures (4.4 K) compared even to the single crystal
NiBi3. However, in certain parameter space, the film surfaces were spattered
with nanoscale features, such as nanowires and nanorods. Ambient temperature
deposition resulted in polycrystalline NiBi3 nanorods which were controllable
with the evaporation rate of Bi. Deposition at elevated temperatures promoted
the emergence of long single crystalline NiBi3 nanorods. High resolution
transmission electron microscopy measurements confirmed the crystalline
behaviour of the nanorods. We believe that NiBi3 nanowires form in a process
analogous to the well known vapor-liquid-solid process, as we observe an
amorphous Bi cap on the nanorods. From glancing angle X-ray diffraction
measurements we identify that the presence of trigonal Bi with hexagonal
primitive cell in the film promotes the nucleation of nanorods. Electrical
transport on a single NiBi3 nanowire shows a superconducting transition of
4.3K.

<i>Zhenglu Li, Gabriel Antonius, Yang-Hao Chan, Steven G. Louie</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a workflow of practical calculations of electron-phonon (e-ph)
coupling with many-electron correlation effects included using the GW
perturbation theory (GWPT). This workflow combines BerkeleyGW, ABINIT, and EPW
software packages to enable accurate e-ph calculations at the GW self-energy
level, going beyond standard calculations based on density functional theory
(DFT) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). This workflow begins
with DFT and DFPT calculations (ABINIT) as starting point, followed by GW and
GWPT calculations (BerkeleyGW) for the quasiparticle band structures and e-ph
matrix elements on coarse electron k- and phonon q-grids, which are then
interpolated to finer grids through Wannier interpolation (EPW) for
computations of various e-ph coupling determined physical quantities such as
the electron self-energies or solutions of anisotropic Eliashberg equations,
among others. A gauge-recovering symmetry unfolding technique is developed to
reduce the computational cost of GWPT (as well as DFPT) while fulfilling the
gauge consistency requirement for Wannier interpolation.

<h3>Environmental memory facilitates search with home returns</h3>

<br>
<br>
Search processes in the natural world are often punctuated by home returns
that reset the position of foraging animals, birds, and insects. Many
theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies have now demonstrated that
this strategy can drastically facilitate search, which could explain its
prevalence. To further facilitate search, foragers also work as a group:
modifying their surroundings in highly sophisticated ways e.g., by leaving
chemical scent trails that imprint the memory of previous excursions. Here, we
design a controlled experiment to show that the benefit coming from such
``environmental memory'' is significant even for a single, non-intelligent,
searcher that is limited to simple physical interactions with its surroundings.
To this end, we employ a self-propelled bristle robot that moves randomly
within an arena filled with obstacles that the robot can push around. To mimic
home returns, we reset the bristle robot's position at constant time intervals.
We show that trails created by the robot give rise to a form of environmental
memory that facilitates search by increasing the effective diffusion
coefficient. Numerical simulations, and theoretical estimates, designed to
capture the essential physics of the experiment support our conclusions and
indicate that these are not limited to the particular system studied herein.

<h3>A magnetic structure of ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) and altermagnetism</h3>

<br>
<i>S. W. Lovesey, D. D. Khalyavin, G. van der Laan</i>
<br>
<br>
The magnetic structure of RuO2 and the Ru atomic configuration are unknown. A
magnetic structure is inferred by confronting measured and calculated Bragg
diffraction patterns and adjusting the latter to achieve satisfactory
agreement. An accepted pattern, a magnetic symmetry, includes symmetry of sites
occupied by the magnetic ions. As a realistic starting point, we provide
diffraction patterns for a magnetic symmetry of RuO2, a descendent of the
tetragonal parent structure, which accommodates a departure of Ru axial dipoles
from the crystal c axis. A chiral signal and piezomagnetic effect are
permitted, and a linear magnetoelectric effect forbidden. Features of the
neutron diffraction pattern test the non-relativistic requirement of
altermagnetism, and we scrutinize published room-temperature data.
Specifically, one Bragg point is consistent with Ru orbital angular momentum
and magnetic quadrupole both zero, and the latter result is not expected from
non-relativistic altermagnetism. Azimuthal angle scans in resonant x-ray
diffraction are sensitive to the Ru site symmetry and the atomic configuration.
Acid tests of the studied magnetic symmetry include a chiral signature and null
intensity for unrotated photon polarization.

<h3>Coherent states and their superpositions (cat states) in  microwave-induced resistance oscillations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12160" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12160</a>
<br>
<i>Jesus Inarrea</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a novel theoretical approach on the microwave-induced resistance
oscillations based on the coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
We first obtain an expression for the coherent states of driven-quantum
harmonic oscillators that are used, in the model of microwaveinduced electron
orbits, to calculate magnetoresistance under radiation. Thus, we find that the
principle of minimum uncertainty of coherent states, involving time and energy,
is at the heart of photo-oscillations and zero resistance states. Accordingly,
we are able to explain important experimental evidence of this remarkable
effect. Such as the physical origin of oscillations, their periodicity with the
inverse of the magnetic field, their peculiar minima and maxima positions and
the existence of zero resistance states. We apply our theory to the case of
ultra-high mobility samples where we appeal to the principle of quantum
superposition of coherent states and obtain that Schrodinger cat states (even
and odd coherent states) are key to explain magnetoresistance at these extreme
mobilities. With them we explain the, experimentally obtained,
magnetoresistance resonance peak shift to a magnetic field where the cyclotron
frequency equals half the radiation frequency. This effect is similar to the
one described in quantum optics as a second harmonic generation process. We
also explain the magnetoresistance collapse, that take place in the dark and
with light. This effect is known as giant negative magnetoresistance. We
generalize our results to study the case of a three-component or triangular
Schrodinger cat state.

<br>
<i>Guido Giachetti, Andrea De Luca</i>
<br>
<br>
We study an exactly solvable model of monitored dynamics in a system of $N$
spin $1/2$ particles with pairwise all-to-all noisy interactions, where each
spin is constantly perturbed by weak measurements of the spin component in a
random direction. We make use of the replica trick to account for the Born's
rule weighting of the measurement outcomes in the study of purification and
other observables, with an exact description in the large-$N$ limit. We find
that the nature of the phase transition strongly depends on the number n of
replicas used in the calculation, with the appearance of non-perturbative
logarithmic corrections that destroy the disentangled/purifying phase in the
relevant $n \rightarrow 1$ replica limit. Specifically, we observe that the
purification time of a mixed state in the weak measurement phase is always
exponentially long in the system size for arbitrary strong measurement rates

<br>
<br>
Three-dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetal Mn$_3$Sn has attracted tremendous
attention due to its great application potential. However, the complex magnetic
structures at different temperature intervals make it extremely difficult to
unravel the underlying electronic structures of Mn$_3$Sn. Here, we perform
temperature-dependent optical spectroscopy measurements on single crystalline
Mn$_3$Sn to investigate its charge dynamics. We find that both of the optical
reflectivity $R(\omega)$ and conductivity $\sigma_1(\omega)$ evolve very
smoothly across the magnetic phase transition at $T_M$ = 285 K, where the giant
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at room temperature drops significantly.
Furthermore, two linearly increasing segments of $\sigma_1(\omega)$ are
observed in the whole temperature range from 300 K to 10 K, indicating that the
existence of Weyl fermions is very robust against the magnetic phase
transition. In addition, the Weyl points closest to the Fermi level $E_F$ are
identified to be located about 101 meV away from $E_F$ at 10 K, and the
associated Fermi velocity is about 2.55 $\times 10^7$ cm/s. Our results reveal
that the phase transition at $T_M$ only generates subtle modification to the
band structure, which helps to further uncover the mechanism of the dramatic
change of AHE in Mn$_3$Sn.

Brain-inspired computing has the potential to change the current paradigm
based on the von Neumann architecture, boosting machine learning applications.
Signalling in our brains relies on voltage-gated ion channels, which have the
electrical behaviour of memristors, a resistor with memory. We use molecular
dynamics simulations, continuum models, and electrophysiological experiments to
investigate the concept of a bioinspired hydrophobically gated memristive
nanopore. We found that hydrophobic gating enables memory by an electrowetting
mechanism, for which we formulate simple design rules. We engineered a
biological nanopore, to produce the typical hysteresis cycles of a memristor.
This route can be used to realise compact, economical, and flexible bioinspired
memristors.

We consider a ferromagnetic particle levitated in air under microwave
irradiation and theoretically study the noise in its rigid-body rotation
induced by the gyromagnetic effect. This rotational noise includes useful
information on angular momentum transfer from the magnetization to the
rigid-body rotation, such as the unit of angular momentum per one spin
relaxation process. We formulate the rotational noise in terms of the Lindblad
equation, which describes the quantum stochastic process, and estimate it in
the case of realistic experimental parameters. We show that a bifurcation
phenomenon observed in our setup amplifies the noise and, therefore, can be
exploited making an accurate measurement of the rotational noise.

<br>
<br>
The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is an exotic
superconducting phase formed by Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass
momentum $q$. On theoretical grounds, the superconducting order parameter in
the FFLO state is spatially modulated along the $q$ vector, and the emergence
of an associated anisotropy is expected at the phase transition from the
Abrikosov state to the FFLO state. Here, we report the results of
high-resolution magnetostriction measurements for a single crystal of
CeCoIn$_5$ around $B \parallel c$. We find two anomalies in the
magnetostriction along the $c$ axis, parallel to the magnetic-field
orientation. In sharp contrast, this $B_{\rm K}$ anomaly disappears in the
magnetostriction along the $a$-axis direction, perpendicular to the
magnetic-field orientation. To explain this uniaxial expansion, we suggest a
possibility that the FFLO transition occurs slightly below the upper critical
field, and the FFLO modulation vector parallel to the applied magnetic field
gives rise to the anisotropic response.

<h3>Graphical Representations and Worm Algorithms for the O($N$) Spin Model</h3>

<br>
We present a family of graphical representations for the O($N$) spin model,
where $N \ge 1$ represents the spin dimension, and $N=1,2,3$ corresponds to the
Ising, XY and Heisenberg models, respectively. With an integer parameter $0 \le
\ell \le N/2$, each configuration is the coupling of $\ell$ copies of subgraphs
consisting of directed flows and $N -2\ell$ copies of subgraphs constructed by
undirected loops, which we call the XY and Ising subgraphs, respectively. On
each lattice site, the XY subgraphs satisfy the Kirchhoff flow-conservation law
and the Ising subgraphs obey the Eulerian bond condition. Then, we formulate
worm-type algorithms and simulate the O($N$) model on the simple-cubic lattice
for $N$ from 2 to 6 at all possible $\ell$. It is observed that the worm
algorithm has much higher efficiency than the Metropolis method, and, for a
given $N$, the efficiency is an increasing function of $\ell$. Beside Monte
Carlo simulations, we expect that these graphical representations would provide
a convenient basis for the study of the O($N$) spin model by other
state-of-the-art methods like the tensor network renormalization.

<h3>Superconductivity and magnetism in the surface states of ABC-stacked  multilayer graphene</h3>

<i>Oladunjoye A. Awoga, Tomas Löthman, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</i>
<br>
<br>
ABC-stacked multilayer graphene (ABC-MLG) exhibits topological surface flat
bands with a divergent density of states, leading to many-body instabilities at
charge neutrality. Here, we explore electronic ordering within a mean-field
approach with full generic treatment of all spin-isotropic, two-site charge
density and spin interactions up to next-nearest neighbor (NNN) sites. We find
that surface superconductivity and magnetism are significantly enhanced over
bulk values. We find spin-singlet $s$-wave and unconventional NNN bond
spin-triplet $f$-wave to be the dominant superconducting pairing symmetries,
both with a full energy gap. By establishing the existence of ferromagnetic
intra-sublattice interaction, ($J_2<0$) we conclude that the $f$-wave state is
favored in ABC-MLG, in sharp contrast to bulk ABC-graphite where chiral d- or
p-wave states, together with s-wave states, display stronger ordering
tendencies albeit not achievable at charge neutrality. We trace this
distinctive surface behavior to the strong sublattice polarization of the
surface flat bands. We also find competing ferrimagnetic order, fully
consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The magnetic
order interpolates between sublattice ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism,
but only with the ratio of the sublattice magnetic moments ($R$) being
insensitive to the DFT exchange correlation functional. We finally establish
the full phase diagram by constraining the interactions to the $R$-value
identified by DFT. We find $f$-wave superconductivity being favored for all
weak to moderately strong couplings $J_2$ and as long as $J_2$ is a
sufficiently large part of the full interaction mix. Gating ABC-MLG away from
charge neutrality further enhances the $f$-wave state over the ferrimagnetic
state, establishing ABC-MLG as a strong candidate for $f$-wave
superconductivity.

We consider the Lifshitz topological transitions and the corresponding
changes in the galvanomagnetic properties of a metal from the point of view of
a general classification of open electron trajectories arising in a magnetic
field on Fermi surfaces of arbitrary complexity. The construction of such a
classification is the content of the Novikov problem and is based on the
division of non-closed electron trajectories into topologically regular and
chaotic trajectories. The description of stable topologically regular
trajectories forms the basis for a complete classification of non-closed
trajectories on arbitrary Fermi surfaces and is connected with special
topological structures on these surfaces. Using this classification, we
describe here the distinctive features of changes in the picture of electron
trajectories during Lifshitz transitions, as well as changes in the
conductivity behavior in the presence of a strong magnetic field. As it turns
out, the use of such an approach makes it possible to describe not only the
changes associated with stable electron trajectories, but also the description
of changes in the general picture of the conductivity diagram in strong
magnetic fields.

Following a theoretical proposal on multi-impurity charge Kondo circuits [T.
K. T. Nguyen and M. N. Kiselev, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 97}, 085403 (2018)] and the
experimental breakthrough in fabrication of the two-site Kondo simulator [W.
Pouse {\it et al}, Nat. Phys. (2023)] we investigate a thermoelectric transport
through a double-dot charge Kondo quantum nano-device in the strong coupling
operational regime. We focus on the fingerprints of the non-Fermi liquid and
its manifestation in the charge and heat quantum transport. We construct a
full-fledged quantitative theory describing crossovers between different
regimes of the multi-channel charge Kondo quantum circuits and discuss possible
experimental realizations of the theory.

<br>
<br>
The fundamental understanding of the metal/ceramic interface is of crucial
importance to diverse fields such as spintronics, energy conversion and storage
devices, as well as fusion reactors. The conditions whereby epitaxy is achieved
are commonly believed to be mostly governed by misfit strain. We report on a
systematic investigation of growth and interface structure of single
crystalline tungsten thin films on two different metal oxide substrates,
Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ ($11\bar{2}0$) and MgO ($001$). X-ray scattering techniques and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy have been used to assess the
overall epitaxial quality of the tungsten layers. We demonstrate that despite
the significant mismatch for both substrates, enhanced crystal quality is
observed for tungsten grown on the sapphire substrates. This is promoted by
stronger adhesion and chemical bonding with sapphire compared to magnesium
oxide, along with the restructuring of the tungsten layers close to the
sapphire/tungsten interface. The latter is supported by ab initio calculations
using density functional theory. Finally, we demonstrate the growth of magnetic
heterostructures consisting of high-quality tungsten layers in combination with
ferromagnetic CoFe layers, which are relevant for spintronic applications.

The conventional understanding has always been that noble gases are
chemically inert and do not affect materials properties. This belief has led to
their use as a standard reference in various experimental applications through
noble gas implantation. However, in our research, using first-principles
calculations, we delve into the effects of noble gas defects on the properties
of several functional oxides, thereby questioning this long-held assumption. We
provide evidence that noble gases can indeed serve as functional defects. They
have the potential to decentralize the localized defect states and prompt a
shift of electrons from a localized state to the main conduction band. Our
investigation unveils that noble gas defects can indeed significantly alter
material properties. Thus, we underscore the importance of factoring in such
defects when assessing material properties.

<h3>Unexpected antagonism between ferroelectricity and Rashba effects in  epitaxially strained SrTiO$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Rashba interaction appearing in materials characterized by polar
displacements is at the core of spin-orbitronic applications enabling
spin-charge currents interconversion. The efficiency of the conversion is
related to the Rashba parameter, usually assumed to depend directly on the
spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and polar displacements amplitude. Here I show, on
the basis of first-principles simulations, that ferroelectric phases of
SrTiO$_3$ reached under epitaxial compressive strain are characterized by an
unexpected suppression of Rashba effects at the bottom of the conduction band
when polar displacements amplitude increases. By carefully inspecting the role
of individual lattice distortions on electronic states, this peculiar behavior
is ascribed to the suppression of Ti t$_{2g}$ orbital degeneracies induced by
polar displacements thereby weakening the SOI and hence Rashba effects. This
antagonism observed in SrTiO$_3$ thus highlights that large polar displacements
are not necessarily a prerequisite for reaching a sizable Rashba parameter and
that the latter quantity might be bounded to a upper value.

In this work, density functional theory (DFT) based calculations were
performed to compute the physical properties (structural stability, mechanical
behavior, electronic, thermodynamic, and optical properties) of synthesized MAX
phases Hf2SB, Hf2SC, Hf2SeB, Hf2SeC, Hf2TeB, and the as-yet-undiscovered MAX
carbide phase Hf2TeC. Calculations of formation energy, phonon dispersion
curves, and elastic constants confirmed the stability of the aforementioned
compounds. The obtained values of lattice parameters, elastic constants, and
elastic moduli of Hf2SB, Hf2SC, Hf2SeB, Hf2SeC, and Hf2TeB showed fair
agreement with earlier studies, whereas the values of the mentioned parameters
for the predicted Hf2TeC exhibit a good consequence of B replacement by C. The
anisotropic mechanical properties are exhibited by the considered MAX phases.
The metallic nature and its anisotropic behavior were revealed by the
electronic band structure and density of states. The analysis of the thermal
properties Debye temperature, melting temperature, minimum thermal
conductivity, and Gruneisen parameter confirmed that the carbide phases were
more suited than the boride phases considered herein. The MAX phase response to
incoming photons further demonstrated that they were metallic. Their
suitability for use as coating materials to prevent solar heating was
demonstrated by the reflectivity spectra. Additionally, this study demonstrated
the impact of B replacing C in the MAX phases.

Networks of atom-centered coordination octahedra commonly occur in inorganic
and hybrid solid-state materials. Characterizing their spatial arrangements and
characteristics is crucial for relating structures to properties for many
materials families. The traditional method using case-by-case inspection
becomes prohibitive for discovering trends and similarities in large datasets.
Here, we operationalize chemical intuition to automate the geometric parsing,
quantification, and classification of coordination octahedral networks. We find
axis-resolved tilting trends in ABO$_{3}$ perovskite polymorphs, which assist
in detecting oxidation state changes. Moreover, we develop a scale-invariant
encoding scheme to represent these networks, which, combined with
human-assisted unsupervised machine learning, allows us to taxonomize the
inorganic framework polytypes in hybrid iodoplumbates (A$_x$Pb$_y$I$_z$).
Consequently, we uncover a violation of Pauling's third rule and the design
principles underpinning their topological diversity. Our results offer a
glimpse into the vast design space of atomic octahedral networks and inform
high-throughput, targeted screening of specific structure types.

<h3>Josephson Diode Effect in Andreev Molecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12273" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12273</a>
<br>
<i>J.-D. Pillet, S. Annabi, A. Peugeot, H. Riechert, E. Arrighi, J. Griesmar, L. Bretheau</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a new platform for observing the Josephson diode effect: the
Andreev molecule. This nonlocal electronic state is hosted in circuits made of
two closely spaced Josephson junctions, through the hybridization of the
Andreev states. The Josephson diode effect occurs at the level of one
individual junction while the other one generates the required time-reversal
and spatial-inversion symmetry breaking. We present a microscopic description
of this phenomenon based on fermionic Andreev states, focusing on single
channels in the short limit, and we compute both supercurrent and energy
spectra. We demonstrate that the diode efficiency can be tuned by magnetic flux
and the junctions transmissions, and can reach $45~\%$. Going further, by
analyzing the Andreev spectra, we demonstrate the key role played by the
continuum, which consists of leaky Andreev states and is largely responsible
for the critical current asymmetry. On top of proposing an experimentally
accessible platform, this work elucidates the microscopic origin of the
Josephson diode effect at the level of the fermionic Andreev states.

<h3>Quantum droplets with particle imbalance in one-dimensional optical  lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Jofre Vallès-Muns, Ivan Morera, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Bruno Juliá-Díaz</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the formation of particle-imbalanced quantum droplets in a
one-dimensional optical lattice containing a binary bosonic mixture at zero
temperature. To understand the effects of the imbalance from both the few- and
many-body perspectives, we employ density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
simulations and perform the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. In
contrast to the particle-balanced case, not all bosons are paired, resulting in
an interplay between bound states and individual atoms that leads to intriguing
phenomena. Quantum droplets manage to sustain a small particle imbalance,
resulting in an effective magnetization. However, as the imbalance is further
increased, a critical point is eventually crossed, and the droplets start to
expel the excess particles while the magnetization in the bulk remains
constant. Remarkably, the unpaired particles on top of the quantum droplet
effectively form a super Tonks-Girardeau (hard-rod) gas. The expulsion point
coincides with the critical density at which the size of the super
Tonks-Girardeau gas matches the size of the droplet.

<h3>Unveiling universal aspects of the cellular anatomy of the brain</h3>

<br>
<i>Helen S. Ansell, István A. Kovács</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent cellular-level volumetric brain reconstructions have revealed an
astronomical level of anatomic complexity. Determining which structural aspects
of the brain to focus on, especially when comparing with computational models
and other organisms, remains a major challenge. Here we quantify aspects of
this complexity and show evidence that brain anatomy satisfies universal
scaling laws, establishing the notion of structural criticality in the cellular
structure of the brain. Our framework builds upon understanding of critical
systems to provide clear guidance in selecting informative structural
properties of brain anatomy. As an illustration, we obtain estimates for
critical exponents in the human, mouse and fruit fly brains and show that they
are consistent between organisms. Such universal quantities are robust to many
of the microscopic details of individual brains, providing a key step towards
generative computational brain models, and also clarifying in which sense one
animal may be a suitable anatomic model for another.

<h3>Nonreciprocal Josephson linear response</h3>

<br>
<i>Pauli Virtanen, Tero T. Heikkilä</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider the finite-frequency response of multiterminal Josephson
junctions and show how non-reciprocity in them can show up at linear response,
in contrast to the static Josephson diodes featuring non-linear
non-reciprocity. At finite frequencies, the response contains dynamic
contributions to the Josephson admittance, featuring the effects of Andreev
bound state transitions along with Berry phase effects, and reflecting the
breaking of the same symmetries as in Josephson diodes. We show that outside
exact Andreev resonances, the junctions feature non-reciprocal reactive
response. As a result, the microwave transmission through those systems is
non-dissipative, and the electromagnetic scattering can approach complete
non-reciprocity. Besides providing information about the nature of the weak
link energy levels, the non-reciprocity can be utilized to create
non-dissipative and small-scale on-chip circulators whose operation requires
only rather small magnetic fields.

Silicon Carbide (SiC) is an outstanding material, not only for electronic
applications, but also for projected functionalities in the realm of photonic
quantum technologies, nano-mechanical resonators and photonics on-a-chip. For
shaping 3D structures out of SiC wafers, predominantly dry-etching techniques
are used. SiC is nearly inert with respect to wet-etching, occasionally
photoelectrochemical etching strategies have been applied. Here, we propose an
electrochemical etching strategy that solely relies on defining etchable
volumina by implantation of p-dopands. Together with the inertness of the
n-doped regions, very sharp etching contrasts can be achieved. We present
devices as different as monolithic cantilevers, disk-shaped optical resonators
and membranes etched out of a single crystal wafer. The high quality of the
resulting surfaces can even be enhanced by thermal treatment, with shape-stable
devices up to and even beyond 1550{\deg}C. The versatility of our approach
paves the way for new functionalities on SiC as high-performance
multi-functional wafer platform.

We examine spin density wave and triplet superconductivity as possible ground
states of the Bernal bilayer graphene. The spin density wave is stable for the
unbiased and undoped bilayer. Both the doping and the applied bias voltage
destroy this phase. We show that, when biased and slightly doped, bilayer can
host a triplet superconducting phase. The mechanisms for both ordered phases
rely on the renormalized Coulomb interaction. Consistency of our theoretical
conclusions with recent experimental results are discussed.

<h3>Systems, variational principles and interconnections in nonequilibrium  thermodynamics</h3>

<br>
<i>François Gay-Balmaz, Hiroaki Yoshimura</i>
<br>
<br>
The paper investigates a systematic approach to modeling in nonequilibrium
thermodynamics by focusing upon the notion of interconnections, where we
propose a novel Lagrangian variational formulation of such interconnected
systems by extending the variational principle of Hamilton in mechanics. In
particular, we show how a nonequilibrium thermodynamic system can be regarded
as an interconnected system of primitive physical elements or subsystems
throughout an interconnection. While this approach is new in nonequilibrium
thermodynamics, this idea has been known as a useful tool for the modeling of
complicated systems in networks as well as in mechanics. Hence, the setting
developed in this paper yields a promising direction for building a unifying
description in various areas of modern science via thermodynamic principles,
while being at the same time related to the early developments of variational
mechanics.

<br>
<br>
Anisotropic transport properties have been assessed in a number of cuprate
superconductors, providing evidence for a nematic state. Here, we analyze
recent experimental data for ultrathin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ (YBCO) films,
where nematicity is induced via strain engineering, leading to a suppression of
charge density wave scattering along the orthorhombic a-axis and a concomitant
enhancement of strange metal behavior along the b-axis. It is shown that the
anisotropic properties strongly depend on the substrate, which we characterize
by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Based on the AFM data, we provide a
microscopic model that can account for the absence (presence) of nematicity and
the resulting transport properties in films grown on SrTiO$_3$ (MgO)
substrates.

<br>
<br>
Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is an efficient mechanism to
readout the spin of solid-state color centers at room temperature, thus
enabling spin-based quantum sensors of magnetic field, electric field, and
temperature with high sensitivity and broad commercial applicability. The
mechanism of room temperature ODMR is based on spin-dependent relaxation
between the optically excited states to the ground states, and thus it is an
intrinsic property of a defect center. In this work we report that two distinct
defect types exist in GaN based on their ODMR signatures. One group has small
negative ODMR based on a spin in a metastable state. The second group has large
(up to $\sim$30\%) positive ODMR contrast based on ground-state spin. Because
GaN is a mature semiconductor with well-developed electronic technologies
already developed, this defect platform is promising for integrated quantum
sensing applications.

<br>
<br>
Interlayer exciton diffusion is studied in atomically-reconstructed
MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers with suppressed disorder. Local atomic registry is
confirmed by characteristic optical absorption, circularly-polarized
photoluminescence, and g-factor measurements. Using transient microscopy we
observe propagation properties of interlayer excitons that are independent from
trapping at moir\'e- or disorder-induced local potentials. Confirmed by
characteristic temperature dependence for free particles, linear diffusion
coefficients of interlayer excitons at liquid helium temperature and low
excitation densities are almost 1000 times higher than in previous
observations. We further show that exciton-exciton repulsion and annihilation
contribute nearly equally to non-linear propagation by disentangling the two
processes in the experiment and simulations. Finally, we demonstrate effective
shrinking of the light-emission over time across several 100's of picoseconds
at the transition from exciton- to the plasma-dominated regimes. Supported by
microscopic calculations for bandgap renormalization to identify Mott
threshold, this indicates transient crossing between rapidly expanding,
short-lived electron-hole plasma and slower, long-lived exciton populations.

<br>
<br>
Cuprate superconductors are strongly sensitive materials to disorder and
oxygen stoichiometry; even minute variations of those parameters drastically
change their electronic properties. Here we exploit this characteristic to
engineer a memristive device based on the high-T_C superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x
(YBCO), in which local changes of the oxygen content and induced disorder are
exploited to produce memory effects. These effects are triggered electrically
in a three-terminal device whose structure is reminiscent of a transistor,
consisting of a YBCO channel and an Al gate. The Al/YBCO interface, which
controls the gate conductance, displays a giant, bipolar, reversible switching
across a continuum of non-volatile conductance states that span over two
Decades. This phenomenon is controlled by the gate voltage magnitude and is
caused by oxygen exchange between YBCO and Al. Concomitantly, the channel shows
a gradual, irreversible superconductor-to-insulator transition that retains a
memory of the power dissipated in the device, and can be explained by induced
bulk disorder. The observed effects, and the understanding of the interplay
between the underlying mechanisms, constitute interesting ingredients for the
design and realization of novel memristors and switches for superconducting
electronics.
