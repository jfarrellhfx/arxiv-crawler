<h3>Multiple Andreev reflections in two-dimensional Josephson junctions with  broken time-reversal symmetry</h3>

Andreev bound states (ABS) occur in Josephson junctions when the total phase
of the Andreev and normal reflections is a multiple of $2\pi$. In ballistic
junctions with an applied voltage bias, a quasi-particle undergoes multiple
Andreev reflections before entering the leads, resulting in peaks in the
current-voltage $I(V)$ curve. Here we present a general model for Josephson
junctions with spin-active interlayers i.e., magnetic or topological materials
with broken time-reversal symmetry. We investigate how ABS change the peak
positions and shape of $I(V)$, which becomes asymmetric for a single incident
angle. We show how the angle-resolved $I(V)$ curve becomes a spectroscopic tool
for the chirality and degeneracy of ABS.

<h3>Spin-charge separation and unconventional superconductivity in  \textit{t}-\textit{J} model on honeycomb lattice</h3>

The physical nature of doped Mott-insulator has been intensively studied for
more than three decades. It is well known that the single band Hubbard model or
$t$-$J$ model on the bipartite lattice is the simplest model to describe a
doped Mott insulator. Unfortunately, the key mechanism of superconductivity in
these toy models is still under debate. In this paper, we propose a new
mechanism for the $d+id$-wave superconductivity (SC) that occurs in the
small-doping region of the honeycomb lattice $t$-$J$ model based on the
Grassmann tensor product state numerical simulation and spin-charge separation
formulation. Moreover, in the presence of anti-ferromagnetic order, a continuum
effective field theory for holons is developed near half-filling. It reveals
the competition between repulsive and attractive holon interactions induced by
spinon fluctuations and gauge fluctuations, respectively. At a large value of
$t/J$, the repulsive interaction dominates, leading to the non-Fermi liquid
like behavior; while in a moderate range of $t/J$, the attractive interaction
dominates, leading to the SC order. Possible experimental detection of
spin-charge separation phenomena is also discussed.

We explain the unusual behavior of so-called relativistic plasmon observed in
gated two-dimensional(2D) electron systems. We attribute the reported features
to excitation of 2D electron analog of conventional Helmholtz resonator. The
output frequency, hydrodynamic parameters and technical realization of 2D
Helmholtz resonator are analyzed. We discuss feasibility of generator called

We report on molecular dynamics simulations of spacetime correlations of the
Toda lattice in thermal equilibrium. The correlations of stretch, momentum, and
energy are computed numerically over a wide range of pressure and temperature.
Our numerical results are compared with the predictions from linearized
generalized hydrodynamics on the Euler scale. The system size is N=3000,4000
and time t =600, at which ballistic scaling is well confirmed. With no
adjustable parameters, the numerically obtained scaling functions agree with
the theory within a precision of less than 3.5%.

<h3>Nematic Torques in Scalar Active Matter: when Fluctuations Favor Polar  Order and Persistence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02568" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02568</a>
<br>
<i>Gianmarco Spera, Charlie Duclut, Marc Durand, Julien Tailleur</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the impact of nematic alignment on scalar active matter in the
disordered phase. We show that nematic torques control the emergent physics of
particles interacting via pairwise forces and can either induce or prevent
phase separation. The underlying mechanism is a fluctuation-induced
renormalization of the mass of the polar field that generically arises from
nematic torques. The correlations between the fluctuations of the polar and
nematic fields indeed conspire to increase the particle persistence length,
contrary to what phenomenological computations predict. This effect is generic
and our theory also quantitatively accounts for how nematic torques enhance
particle accumulation along confining boundaries and opposes demixing in
mixtures of active and passive particles.

<h3>Optical Control of Slow Topological Electrons in Moir√© Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02248" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02248</a>
<br>
<i>Christopher Yang, Iliya Esin, Cyprian Lewandowski, Gil Refael</i>
<br>
<br>
Floquet moir\'e materials possess optically-induced flat-electron bands with
steady-states sensitive to drive parameters. Within this regime, we show that
strong interaction screening and phonon bath coupling can overcome enhanced
drive-induced heating. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) irradiated by a
terahertz-frequency continuous circularly polarized laser, the extremely slow
electronic states enable the drive to control the steady state occupation of
high-Berry curvature electronic states. In particular, above a critical field
amplitude, high-Berry-curvature states exhibit a slow regime where they
decouple from acoustic phonons, allowing the drive to control the anomalous
Hall response. Our work shows that the laser-induced control of topological and
transport physics in Floquet TBG are measurable using experimentally available
probes.

<h3>Strong pinning transition with arbitrary defect potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02254" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02254</a>
<br>
<i>Filippo Gaggioli, Gianni Blatter, Martin Buchacek, Vadim B. Geshkenbein</i>
<br>
<br>
Dissipation-free current transport in type II superconductors requires
vortices to be pinned by defects in the underlying material. The pinning
capacity of a defect is quantified by the Labusch parameter $\kappa \sim
f_p/\xi\bar{C}$, measuring the pinning force $f_p$ relative to the elasticity
$\bar{C}$ of the vortex lattice, with $\xi$ denoting the coherence length (or
vortex core size) of the superconductor. The critical value $\kappa = 1$
separates weak from strong pinning, with a strong defect at $\kappa > 1$ able
to pin a vortex on its own. So far, this weak-to-strong pinning transition has
been studied for isotropic defect potentials, resulting in a critical exponent
$\mu = 2$ for the onset of the strong pinning force density $F_\mathrm{pin}
\sim n_p f_p (\xi/a_0)^2(\kappa-1)^\mu$, with $n_ p$ denoting the density of
defects and $a_0$ the intervortex distance. The behavior changes dramatically
when studying anisotropic defects with no special symmetries: the strong
pinning then originates out of isolated points with length scales growing as
$\xi (\kappa - 1)^{1/2}$, resulting in a different force exponent $\mu = 5/2$.
Our analysis of the strong pinning onset for arbitrary defect potentials
$e_p(\mathbf{R})$, with $\mathbf{R}$ a planar coordinate, makes heavy use of
the Hessian matrix describing its curvature and leads us to interesting
geometrical structures. Both, onset and merger points are defined by local
differential properties of the Hessian's determinant $D(\mathbf{R})$,
specifically, its minima and saddle points. Extending our analysis to the case
of a random two-dimensional pinning landscape, we discuss the topological
properties of unstable and bistable regions as expressed through the Euler
characteristic, with the latter related to the local differential properties of
$D(\mathbf{R})$ through Morse theory.

<h3>Layer photovoltaic effect in van der Waals heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02255</a>
<br>
<i>Oles Matsyshyn, Ying Xiong, Arpit Arora, Justin C. W. Song</i>
<br>
<br>
We argue that the layer electric polarization of noncentrosymmetric layered
heterostructures can be generically controlled by light yielding a layer
photovoltaic effect (LPE). The LPE possesses a rich phenomenology and can arise
from myriad distinct mechanisms displaying strong sensitivity to symmetry
(e.g., point group and time-reversal) as well as the presence/absence of a
Fermi surface. We systematically classify these and unveil how LPE manifests
for a range of light polarizations and even for unpolarized light. These
unusual layer photoresponses can be realized in a range of layered
heterostructures such as bilayer graphene aligned on hexagonal Boron Nitride
and manifest sizeable layer polarization susceptibilities in the terahertz
frequency range that can be used as novel means of bulk photodetection.

We calculate the susceptibility of a canonical ensemble of quantum
oscillators to the singular random metric. If the covariance of the metric is
$\vert {\bf x}-{\bf x}^{\prime}\vert^{-4\alpha}$ $0< \alpha<\frac{1}{2}$ then
the expansion of the partition function in powers of the temperature involves

A computational multiscale approach combining dispersion-corrected density
functional theory (DFT) and long-timescale classical molecular dynamics is
employed to characterize the geometrical, mechanical and thermal properties of
a recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide
NiCl$_2$. A classical interatomic force field is proposed whose parameters are
derived from the results of DFT calculations. The developed force field is used
to study the mechanical response, thermal stability and melting of a NiCl$_2$
monolayer. It is found that the NiCl$_2$ sheet is thermally stable up to the
melting point temperature of 1315~K. At higher temperatures, structural
degradation of the system is observed, which involves several subsequent
structural transformations, namely the formation of a highly porous 2D sheet,
1D nanowires, and nanodroplets. The computational methodology presented through
an illustrative case study of NiCl$_2$ can be utilized for the computational
characterization of other novel 2D materials, including recently synthesized
NiO$_2$, NiS$_2$ and NiSe$_2$.

<h3>Efficient full frequency GW for metals using a multipole approach for  the dielectric screening</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02282" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02282</a>
<br>
<i>Dario A. Leon, Andrea Ferretti, Daniele Varsano, Elisa Molinari, Claudia Cardoso</i>
<br>
<br>
The properties of metallic systems with important and structured excitations
at low energies, such as Cu, are challenging to describe with simple models
like the plasmon pole approximation (PPA), and more accurate and sometimes
prohibitive full frequency approaches are usually required. In this paper we
propose a numerical approach to $GW$ calculations on metals that takes into
account the frequency dependence of the screening via the multipole
approximation (MPA), an accurate and efficient alternative to current
full-frequency methods that was recently developed and validated for
semiconductors and overcomes several limitations of PPA. We now demonstrate
that MPA can be successfully extended to metallic systems by optimizing the
frequency sampling for this class of materials and introducing a simple method
to include the $\mathbf{q}\to 0$ limit of the intra-band contributions. The
good agreement between MPA and full frequency results for the calculations of
quasi-particle energies, polarizability, self-energy and spectral functions in
different metallic systems confirms the accuracy and computational efficiency
of the method. Finally, we discuss the physical interpretation of the MPA poles
through a comparison with experimental electron energy loss spectra for Cu.

<h3>The cluster decomposition of the configurational energy of  multicomponent alloys</h3>

Lattice models parameterized using first-principles calculations constitute
an effective framework to simulate the thermodynamic behavior of physical
systems. The cluster expansion method is a flexible lattice-based method used
extensively in the study of multicomponent alloys. Yet despite its prevalent
use, a well-defined understanding of expansion terms has remained elusive. In
this letter, we introduce the cluster decomposition as a unique and
basis-agnostic decomposition of any general function of the atomic
configuration in a crystal. We demonstrate that cluster expansions constructed
from arbitrary orthonormal basis sets are all representations of the same
cluster decomposition. We show how the norms of expansion coefficients
associated with the same crystallographic orbit are invariant to changes
between orthonormal bases. Based on its uniqueness and orthogonality
properties, we identify the cluster decomposition as an invariant ANOVA
decomposition. We leverage these results to illustrate how functional analysis
of variance and sensitivity analysis can be used to directly interpret
interactions among species and gain insight into computed thermodynamic
properties. The work we present in this letter opens new directions for
parameter estimation, interpretation, and use of applied lattice models on
well-established mathematical and statistical grounds.

<h3>Localized nonlinear excitations of a columnar chain of coronene  molecules</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02319</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander V. Savin, Sergey V. Dmitriev</i>
<br>
<br>
The nonlinear dynamics of a one-dimensional molecular crystal in the form of
a chain of planar coronene molecules is analyzed. Using molecular dynamics, it
is shown that a chain of coronene molecules supports acoustic solitons,
rotobreathers, and discrete breathers. An increase in the size of planar
molecules in a chain leads to an increase in the number of internal degrees of
freedom. This results in an increase in the rate of emission of phonons from
spatially localized nonlinear excitations and a decrease in their lifetime.
Presented results contribute to the understanding of the effect of the
rotational and internal vibrational modes of molecules on the nonlinear
dynamics of molecular crystals.

<h3>Interlayer Exciton-Phonon Bound State in Bi2Se3/monolayer WS2 van der  Waals Heterostructures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02321</a>

<br>
<br>
The ability to assemble layers of two-dimensional (2D) materials to form
permutations of van der Waals heterostructures provides significant
opportunities in materials design and synthesis. Interlayer interactions
provide a path to new properties and functionality, and understanding such
interactions is essential to that end. Here we report formation of interlayer
exciton-phonon bound states in Bi2Se3/WS2 heterostructures, where the Bi2Se3
A1(3) surface phonon, a mode particularly susceptible to electron-phonon
coupling, is imprinted onto the excitonic emission of the WS2. The
exciton-phonon bound state (or exciton-phonon quasiparticle) presents itself as
evenly separated peaks superposed on the WS2 excitonic photoluminescence
spectrum, whose periodic spacing corresponds to the A1(3) surface phonon
energy. Low-temperature polarized Raman spectroscopy of Bi2Se3 reveals intense
surface phonons and local symmetry breaking that allows the A1(3) surface
phonon to manifest in otherwise forbidden scattering geometries. Our work
advances knowledge of the complex interlayer van der Waals interactions, and
facilitates technologies that combine the distinctive transport and optical
properties from separate materials into one device for possible spintronics,
valleytronics, and quantum computing applications.

<h3>Ab initio calculation of carrier mobility in semiconductors including  ionized-impurity scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02323</a>
<br>
<i>Joshua Leveillee, Xiao Zhang, Emmanouil Kioupakis, Feliciano Giustino</i>
<br>
<br>
The past decade has seen the emergence of ab initio computational methods for
calculating phonon-limited carrier mobilities in semiconductors with predictive
accuracy. More realistic calculations ought to take into account additional
scattering mechanisms such as, for example, impurity and grain-boundary
scattering. In this work, we investigate the effect of ionized-impurity
scattering on the carrier mobility. We model the impurity potential by a
collection of randomly distributed Coulomb scattering centers, and we include
this relaxation channel into the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation, as
implemented in the EPW code. We demonstrate this methodology by considering
silicon, silicon carbide, and gallium phosphide, for which detailed
experimental data are available. Our calculations agree reasonably well with
experiments over a broad range of temperatures and impurity concentrations. For
each compound investigated here, we compare the relative importance of
electron-phonon scattering and ionized-impurity scattering, and we critically
assess the reliability of Matthiessen's rule. We also show that an accurate
description of dielectric screening and carrier effective masses cam improve
quantitative agreement with experiments.

<h3>Electronic and structural properties of M√∂bius boron-nitride and  carbon nanobelts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02325" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02325</a>
<br>
<i>C. Aguiar, N. Dattani, I. Camps</i>
<br>
<br>
Using the semiempirical tight binding method as implemented in the xTB
program, we characterized M\"obius boron-nitride and carbon-based nanobelts
with different sizes and compared them with normal nanobelts. The calculated
properties include the infrared spectra, the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap, the
chemical potential, and the molecular hardness. The agreement between the peaks
positions from theoretical infrared spectra compared with experimental ones for
all systems, validate the used methodology. Our findings show that for the
boron-nitride based nanobelts, the calculated properties have opposite
monotonic relationship with the size of the systems whereas, for the
carbon-based, the properties show the same monotonic relationship for both
types of nanobelts. Also, the torsion presented on the M\"obius nanobelts, in
the case of boron-nitride, induced an inhomogeneous surface distribution for
the HOMO orbitals. In all cases, the properties vary with the increase in the
size of the nanobelts indicating that it is possible to choose the desired
values by changing the size and type of the systems.

<h3>Berry curvature induced valley Hall effect in non-encapsulated  hBN/Bilayer graphene heterostructure aligned with near-zero twist angle</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02358</a>
<br>
<i>Teppei Shintaku, Afsal Kareekunnan, Masashi Akabori, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Hiroshi Mizuta</i>
<br>
<br>
Valley Hall effect has been observed in asymmetric single-layer graphene and
bilayer graphene systems. In single-layer graphene systems, asymmetry is
introduced by aligning graphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with a
near-zero twist angle, thereby breaking the sub-lattice symmetry. Although a
similar approach has been used in bilayer graphene to break the layer symmetry
and thereby observe the valley Hall effect, the bilayer graphene was sandwiched
with hBN on both sides in those studies. It has been shown theoretically that
having hBN on one side and both sides affect the symmetry of the system
differently. Thus, here we show the valley Hall effect through non-local
resistance measurement ($R_{\rm{NL}}$) in non-encapsulated hBN/bilayer graphene
heterostructure where the hBN and bilayer graphene crystallographic axes are
aligned. We also show that the $R_{\rm{NL}}$ can be controlled by applying a
displacement field across the heterostructure. Furthermore, the electronic band
structure and Berry curvature calculations validate the experimental
observations.

<h3>Interfacial magnetic anisotropy controlled spin pumping in  Co60Fe20B20/Pt stack</h3>

<i>Mahammad Tahir, Dhananjay Tiwari, Abhishek Juyal, Rohit Medwal, Soumik Mukhopadhyay</i>
<br>
<br>
Controlled spin transport in magnetic stacks is required to realize pure spin
current-driven logic and memory devices. The control over the generation and
detection of the pure spin current is achieved by tuning the spin to charge
conversion efficiency of the heavy metal interfacing with ferromagnets. Here,
we demonstrate the direct tunability of spin angular momentum transfer and
thereby spin pumping, in CoFeB/Pt stack, with interfacial magnetic anisotropy.
The ultra-low thickness of CoFeB thin film tilts the magnetic easy axis from
in-plane to out-of-plane due to surface anisotropy. The Ferromagnetic resonance
measurements are performed to investigate the magnetic anisotropy and spin
pumping in CoFeB/Pt stacks. We clearly observe tunable spin pumping effect in
the CoFeB/Pt stacks with varying CoFeB thicknesses. The spin current density,
with varying ferromagnetic layer thickness, is found to increase from 0.11 to
0.24 MA/m2, with increasing in-plane anisotropy field. Such interfacial
anisotropy-controlled generation of pure spin current can potentially lead to
next-generation anisotropic spin current-controlled spintronic devices.

<h3>Universal optical polarizability for plasmonic nanostructures</h3>

We develop an analytical model for calculation of optical spectra for metal
nanostructures of arbitrary shape supporting localized surface plasmons (LSPs).
For plasmonic nanostructures with characteristic size below the diffraction
limit, we obtain the explicit expression for optical polarizability that
describes the lineshape of optical spectra solely in terms of the metal
dielectric function and LSP frequency. The amplitude of LSP spectral band is
determined by the effective system volume that, for long wavelength LSPs, can
significantly exceed the physical volume of metal nanostructure. These results
can be used to model or interpret the experimental spectra of plasmonic
nanostructures and to tune their optical properties for various applications.

<h3>Increase in Rod Diffusivity Emerges even in Markovian Nature</h3>

<br>
<br>
Rod-shaped particles embedded in certain matrices have been reported to
exhibit an increase in their center of mass diffusivity upon increasing the
matrix density. This increase has been considered to be caused by a kinetic
constraint in analogy with tube models. Here, we investigate a mobile rod-like
particle in a three-dimensional sea of immobile point obstacles using a kinetic
Monte Carlo scheme equipped with a Markovian process, that generates gas-like
collision times and positions stochastically, so that such kinetic constraints
do essentially not exist. We find that even in such a system, the unusual
increase in diffusivity emerges. This result implies that the kinetic
constraint is not a necessary condition for the increase in the diffusivity.
More generally, this work will provide fresh insight into the kinetics of
non-spherical particles.

<br>
<br>
Exhaustive study of topological semimetal phases of matter in equilibriated
electonic systems and myriad extensions has built upon the foundations laid by
earlier introduction and study of the Weyl semimetal, with broad applications
in topologically-protected quantum computing, spintronics, and optical devices.
We extend recent introduction of multiplicative topological phases to find
previously-overlooked topological semimetal phases of electronic systems in
equilibrium, with minimal symmetry-protection. We show these multiplicative
topological semimetal phases exhibit rich and distinctive bulk-boundary
correspondence and response signatures that greatly expand understanding of
consequences of topology in condensed matter settings, such as the limits on
Fermi arc connectivity and structure, and transport signatures such as the
chiral anomaly. Our work therefore lays the foundation for extensive future
study of multiplicative topological semimetal phases.

Topological integrated circuits are integrated circuit realizations of

instances of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev topological
superconductor model. They are found to realize high frequency resonances
around 17GHz. We explicitly observe the spatial profile of a topological edge
state. In particular, the topological interface state between a topological
segment and a trivial segment is the Majorana-like state in the Kitaev model.
We construct a switchable structure in the integrated circuit, which enables us
to control the position of a Majorana-like interface state arbitrarily along a
chain. Our results will open topological electronics with high frequency
integrated circuits.

<h3>Theory of Edge Effects and Conductunce for Applications in  Graphene-based Nanoantennas</h3>

In this paper, we develop a theory of edge effects in graphene for its
applications to nanoantennas in the terahertz, infrared, and visible frequency
ranges. Its characteristic feature is selfconsistence reached due the
formulation in terms of dynamical conductance instead of ordinary used surface
conductivity. The physical model of edge effects is based on using the concept
of Dirac fermions. The surface conductance is considered as a general
susceptibility and is calculated via the Kubo approach. In contrast with
earlier models, the surface conductance becomes nonhomogeneous and nonlocal.
The spatial behavior of the surface conductance depends on the length of the
sheet and the electrochemical potential. Results of numerical simulations are
presented for lengths in the range of 2.1-800 nm and electrochemical potentials
ranging between 0.1-1.0 eV. It is shown that if the length exceeded 800 nm, our
model agrees with the classical Drude conductivity model with a relatively high
degree of accuracy. For rather short lengths, the conductance usually exhibits
spatial oscillations, which absent in conductivity and strongly affect the
properties of graphene based antennas. The period and amplitude of such spatial
oscillations, strongly depend on the electrochemical potential. The new theory
opens the way for realizing electrically controlled nanoantennas by changing
the electrochemical potential may of the gate voltage. The obtained results may
be applicable for the design of carbon based nanodevices in modern quantum
technologies.

<h3>Half-metal and other fractional metal phases in doped AB bilayer  graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically argue that, in doped AB bilayer graphene, the
electron-electron coupling can give rise to the spontaneous formation of
fractional metal phases. These states, being generalizations of a more common
half-metal, have a Fermi surface that is perfectly polarized not only in terms
of a spin-related quantum number, but also in terms of the valley index. The
proposed mechanism assumes that the ground state of undoped bilayer graphene is
a spin density wave insulator, with a finite gap in the single-electron
spectrum. Upon doping, the insulator is destroyed, and replaced by a fractional
metal phase. As doping increases, transitions between various types of
fractional metal (half-metal, quarter-metal, etc.) are triggered. Our findings
are consistent with recent experiments on doped AB bilayer graphene, in which a
cascade of phase transitions between different isospin states was observed.

<br>
<br>
Despite the usefulness of the anomalous Nernst conductivity
($\alpha^{A}_{xy}$) for studying electronic band structures and exploring
magnetic materials with large transverse thermopower, there has not been a
straightforward way to obtain $\alpha^{A}_{xy}$ in the experiment. Here, we
propose a simple and versatile method enabling direct electrical probing of
$\alpha^{A}_{xy}$, which is realized by creating a closed circuit consisting of
a target magnetic material and a non-magnetic conductor. This method was
experimentally demonstrated on a thin film of magnetic Weyl semimetal
Co$_{2}$MnGa, where the closed circuit was formed simply by connecting both
ends of the Co$_{2}$MnGa film with a Au wire. A good approximation of
$\alpha^{A}_{xy}$ was obtained, validating the proposed method and exhibiting
its potential for aiding the further development of topological materials
science and transverse thermoelectrics.

In this article we develop an effective medium model to characterize the
electron wave propagation in graphene based nanostructures with an
electrostatic and magnetic vector potentials imposed on their surface. We use a
numerical algorithm to determine the effective medium parameters of the
heterostructure and calculate the electronic band structure of the system. We
apply our formalism to analyze superlattices with solely a magnetic potential
and reveal that the response of the structure remains reciprocal and is
characterized by a decrease in charge carrier's velocity. We also study the
response of superlattices with both potentials superimposed on graphene and
show that the response of the system becomes nonreciprocal with a dispersion
characterized by a tilted Dirac cone. We demonstrate that it is possible to
alternate between a type-I, type-II or type-III Dirac cones by properly tuning
the amplitude of the potentials.

<h3>Effects of annealing on the fluctuation conductivity and pseudogap in  slightly doped $HoBa_2Cu_3O_{7-Œ¥}$ single crystals</h3>

<br>
The effect of annealing at room temperature on the fluctuation conductivity
(FLC) $\sigma^\prime(T)$ and pseudogap (PG) $\Delta^*(T)$ in the basal ab plane
of $ReBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$ (Re = Ho) single crystals with a lack of oxygen has
been studied. It is shown that at all stages of annealing, the FLC near $T_c$
can be described by the Aslamazov$-$Larkin and Maki$-$Thompson fluctuation
theories, demonstrating a 3D$-$2D crossover with increasing temperature. The
crossover temperature $T_0$ was used to determine the coherence length along
the $c$-axis, $\xi_c(0)$=2.82 A. At the inter-mediate stage of annealing, an
anomalous increase in 2D FLC was revealed, which is associated with the
influence of uncompensated magnetic moments in $HoBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$
(HoBCO): $\mu_{eff, Ho}$=9.7$\mu_{B}$. For the quenched sample S1, the
temperature dependence of the PG has a shape typical of single crystals with a
large number of defects. However, $\Delta^*(T)$ has two small additional maxima
at high temperature, which is a feature of HoBCO single crystals with
pronounced twins and indicates the two-phase nature of the sample. Upon
annealing, the shape of $\Delta^*(T)$ noticeably changes, very likely due to an
increase in the magnetic interaction (sample S2). More important is the change
in the slope of the data at high temperatures, which has become about 3.5 times
steeper. The ordering of the oxygen distribution due to the diffusion process
during annealing somewhat compensates for the influence of magnetic
interaction. Interestingly, the slope turns out to be the same as for
FeAs-based superconductors, suggesting the possibility of the existence of spin
density waves in HoBCO in the PG state.

<br>
<br>
Motivated by the potential of atomically-thin magnets towards tunable
high-frequency magnonics, we detail the spin-wave dispersion of bilayer
CrI$_3$. We demonstrate that the magnonic behavior of the bilayer strongly
depends on its stacking configuration and the interlayer magnetic ordering,
where a topological bandgap opens in the dispersion caused by the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Kitaev interactions, classifying bilayer CrI$_3$ as a
topological magnon insulator. We further reveal that both size and topology of
the bandgap in a CrI$_3$ bilayer with an antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering
are tunable by an external magnetic field.

Entry of micro- or nano-sized objects into cells or vesicles made of lipid
membranes occur in many processes such as entry of viruses in host cells,
microplastics pollution, drug delivery or biomedical imaging. Here, we
investigated the microparticle crossing of lipid membranes in giant unilamellar
vesicles in the absence of strong binding interactions (e.g.
streptavidin-biotin binding). In these conditions, we observed that organic and
inorganic particles can always penetrate inside the vesicles provided that an
external picoNewton force is applied and for relatively low membrane tensions.
In the limit of a vanishing adhesion, we pointed out the role of the membrane
area reservoir and show that a force minimum exists when the particle size is
comparable to the bendocapillary length.

Implementing topological superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana states (MSs) is
one of the most significant and challenging tasks in both fundamental physics
and topological quantum computations. In this work, taking the obstructed
atomic insulator (OAI) Nb3Br8, s-wave superconductor (SC) NbSe2 and
ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) as example, we propose a new setup to realize the
2D chiral TSC and MSs in the OAI/SC/FMI heterostructure, which could avoid the
subband problem effectively and has the advantage of huge Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. As a result, the TSC phase can be stabilized in a wide region of
chemical potential and Zeeman field, and four distinct TSC phases with
superconducting Chern number N= -1, -2, -3, 3 can be achieved. Moreover, a 2D
BdG Hamiltonian based on the triangular lattice of obstructed Wannier charge
centers, combined with the s-wave superconductivity paring and Zeeman field, is
constructed to understand the whole topological phase diagram analytically.
These results expand the application of OAIs and pave a new way to realize the
TSC and MSs with unique advantages.

Atomically thin layers exfoliated from magnetic van der Waals layered
materials are currently of high interest in solid state physics. VOCl is a
quasi-two-dimensional layered antiferromagnet which was recently synthesized in
monolayer form. Previous theoretical studies have assumed the high-temperature
orthorhombic lattice symmetry also in the low temperature range, where the bulk
system is known to be monoclinic due to a strong magnetoelastic coupling. We
demonstrate from \textit{ab-initio} calulations that this monoclinic distortion
is prevalent also in monolayers, which is in line with recent experimental
indications of monoclinic symmetry. Our calculations also show that competing
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions give rise a frustrated
two-fold magnetic superstructure where higher-order magnetic interactions play
a key role to stabilize the observed magnetic ground state.

A fascinating feature of metallic glasses is their ability to explore
different configurations under mechanical deformations. This effect is usually
observed through macroscopic observables, while little is known on the
consequence of the deformation at atomic level. Using the new generation of
synchrotrons, we probe the atomic motion and structure in a metallic glass
under hydrostatic compression, from the onset of the perturbation up to a
severely-compressed state. While the structure indicates reversible
densification under compression, the dynamic is dramatically accelerated and
exhibits a hysteresis with two regimes. At low pressures, the atomic motion is
heterogeneous with avalanche-like rearrangements suggesting rejuvenation, while
under further compression, aging leads to a super-diffusive dynamics triggered
by internal stresses inherent to the glass. These results highlight the
complexity of the atomic motion in non-ergodic systems and support a theory
recently developed to describe the surprising rejuvenation and strain hardening
of metallic glasses under compression.

Interdiffusion phenomena between adjacent materials are highly prevalent in
semiconductor device architectures and can present a major reliability
challenge for the industry. To fully capture and better understand these
phenomena, experimental approaches must go beyond static and post-mortem
studies to include in-situ and in-operando setups. Here, soft and hard X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS and HAXPES) is used to monitor diffusion in
real-time across a proxy device. The device consists of a
Si/SiO\textsubscript{2}/Ti$_x$W$_{1-x}$(300 nm)/Cu(25 nm) thin film material
stack, with the Ti$_x$W$_{1-x}$ film acting as a diffusion barrier between Si
and Cu. The monitoring of diffusion is achieved through the continuous
collection of spectra whilst in-situ annealing to 673 K. Ti within the TiW is
found to be highly mobile during annealing, diffusing out of the barrier and
accumulating at the Cu surface. Increasing the Ti concentration within the
Ti$_x$W$_{1-x}$ film increases the quantity of accumulated Ti, and Ti is first
detected at the Cu surface at temperatures as low as 550 K. Surprisingly, at
low Ti concentrations ($x$ = 0.054), W is also mobile and diffuses alongside
Ti. These results provide crucial evidence for the importance of diffusion
barrier composition on their efficacy during device application, delivering
insights into the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness and limitations.

Interfaces of dye molecules and two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) combine strong molecular dipole excitations with high
carrier mobilities in semiconductors. F\"orster type energy transfer is one key
mechanism for the coupling between both constituents. We report microscopic
calculations of a spectrally resolved F\"orster induced transition rate from
dye molecules to a TMDC layer. Our approach is based on microscopic Bloch
equations which are solved self-consistently together with Maxwells equations.
This approach allows to incorporate the dielectric environment of a TMDC
semiconductor, sandwiched between donor molecules and a substrate. Our analysis
reveals transfer rates in the meV range for typical dye molecules in closely
stacked structures, with a non-trivial dependence of the F\"orster rate on the
molecular transition energy resulting from unique signatures of dark, momentum
forbidden TMDC excitons.

<h3>Single-point spin Chern number in a supercell framework</h3>

We present an approach for the calculation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
invariant in non-crystalline two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators.
While topological invariants were originally mathematically introduced for
crystalline periodic systems, and crucially hinge on tracking the evolution of
occupied states through the Brillouin zone, the introduction of disorder or
dynamical effects can break the translational symmetry and imply the use of
larger simulation cells, where the $\bf{k}$-point sampling is typically reduced
to the single $\Gamma$-point. Here, we introduce a single-point formula for the
spin Chern number that enables to adopt the supercell framework, where a single
Hamiltonian diagonalisation is performed. Inspired by the work of E. Prodan
[Phys. Rev. B, $\textbf{80}$, 12 (2009)], our single-point approach allows to
calculate the spin Chern number even when the spin operator $\hat{s}_z$ does
not commute with the Hamiltonian, as in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit
coupling. We validate our method on the Kane-Mele model, both pristine and in
the presence of Anderson disorder. Finally, we investigate the disorder-driven
transition from the trivial phase to the topological state known as topological
Anderson insulator. Beyond disordered systems, our approach is particularly
useful to investigate the role of defects, to study topological alloys and in
the context of ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperature.
