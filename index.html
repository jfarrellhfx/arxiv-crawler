We study a model chiral fluid in two dimensions composed of Brownian disks
interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential and a non-conservative transverse
force, mimicking colloids spinning at a rate $\omega$. The system exhibits a
phase separation between a chiral liquid and a dilute gas phase that can be
characterized using a thermodynamic framework. We compute the equations of
state and show that the surface tension controls interface corrections to the
coexisting pressure predicted from the equal-area construction. Transverse
forces increase surface tension and generate edge currents at the liquid-gas
interface. The analysis of these currents shows that the rotational viscosity
introduced in chiral hydrodynamics is consistent with microscopic bulk
mechanical measurements. Chirality can also break the solid phase, giving rise
to a dense fluid made of rotating hexatic patches. Our work paves the way for
the development of the statistical mechanics of chiral particles assemblies.

<h3>Trajectory sampling and finite-size effects in first-principles stopping  power calculations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03213</a>

Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is presently the
most accurate available method for computing electronic stopping powers from
first principles. However, obtaining application-relevant results often
involves either costly averages over multiple calculations or ad hoc selection
of a representative ion trajectory. We consider a broadly applicable,
quantitative metric for evaluating and optimizing trajectories in this context.
This methodology enables rigorous analysis of the failure modes of various
common trajectory choices in crystalline materials. Although randomly selecting
trajectories is common practice in stopping power calculations in solids, we
show that nearly 30% of random trajectories in an FCC aluminium crystal will
not representatively sample the material over the time and length scales
feasibly simulated with TDDFT, and unrepresentative choices incur errors of up
to 60%. We also show that finite-size effects depend on ion trajectory via
"ouroboros" effects beyond the prevailing plasmon-based interpretation, and we
propose a cost-reducing scheme to obtain converged results even when expensive
core-electron contributions preclude large supercells. This work helps to
mitigate poorly controlled approximations in first-principles stopping power
calculations, allowing 1-2 order of magnitude cost reductions for obtaining
representatively averaged and converged results.

We study interacting run and tumble particles in two dimensions, both on a
lattice and in continuum, where particles move in the direction of their
internal orientation. These motile particles can tumble and change their
internal orientation with a fixed rate $\omega;$ $\omega^{-1}$ quantifies the
motility. Starting from interacting particle systems that exhibit phase
separation transitions in the absence of motility, we ask how the ordering in
the system changes when motility is added and increased. We observe that
increased motility impedes cluster formation in a large class of models
including conserved lattice gas, driven lattice gas, and interacting hard-disc
models in continuum, and explain why. We further show that a stable
phase-separated state is ruled out in the absence of any attractive
interaction.

<h3>Transformation of 2-line ferrihydrite to goethite at alkaline pH</h3>

<br>
<br>
The transformation of 2-line ferrihydrite to goethite from supersaturated
solutions at alkaline pH >= 13.0 was studied using a combination of benchtop
and advanced synchrotron techniques such as X-ray diffraction,
thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In comparison to
the transformation rates at acidic to mildly alkaline environments, the
half-life,t_1/2, of 2-line ferrihydrite reduces from several months at pH =
2.0, and approximately 15 days at pH = 10.0, to just under 5 hours at pH =
14.0. Calculated first order rate constants of transformation, k, increase
exponentially with respect to the pH and follow the progression log_10 k =
log_10 k_0 + a*pH^E3. Simultaneous monitoring of the aqueous Fe(III)
concentration via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy
demonstrates that (i) goethite likely precipitates from solution and (ii) its
formation is rate-limited by the comparatively slow re-dissolution of 2-line
ferrihydrite. The analysis presented can be used to estimate the transformation
rate of naturally occurring 2-line ferrihydrite in aqueous electrolytes
characteristic to mine and radioactive waste tailings as well as the formation
of corrosion products in cementitious pore solutions.

Braiding of Majorana states demonstrates their non-Abelian exchange
statistics. One implementation of braiding requires control of the pairwise
couplings between all Majorana states in a trijunction device. In order to have
adiabaticity, a trijunction device requires the desired pair coupling to be
sufficently large and the undesired couplings to vanish. In this work, we
design and simulate of a trijunction device in a two-dimensional electron gas
with a focus on the normal region that connects three Majorana states. We use
an optimisation approach to find the operational regime of the device in a
multi-dimensional voltage space. Using the optimization results, we simulate a
braiding experiment by adiabatically coupling different pairs of Majorana
states without closing the topological gap. We then evaluate the feasibility of
braiding in a trijunction device for different shapes and disorder strengths.

<h3>Demixing in binary mixtures with differential diffusivity at high  density</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spontaneous phase separation, or demixing, is important in biological
phenomena such as cell sorting. In particle-based models, an open question is
whether differences in diffusivity can drive such demixing. While
differential-diffusivity-induced phase separation occurs in mixtures with a
packing fraction up to $0.7$ [Weber et al. Phys Rev Lett 2016], here we
investigate whether demixing persists at even higher densities relevant for
cells. For particle packing fractions between $0.7$ and $1.0$ the system
demixes, but at packing fractions above unity the system remains mixed,
exposing re-entrant behavior in the phase diagram. We also find that a
confluent Voronoi model for tissues does not phase separate, consistent with
the highest-density particle-based simulations.

<h3>Anisotropy and Isotope Effect in Superconducting Solid Hydrogen</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03304</a>

Elucidating the phase diagram of solid hydrogen is a key objective in
condensed matter physics. Several decades ago, it was proposed that at low
temperatures and high pressures, solid hydrogen would be a metal with a high
superconducting transition temperature. This transition to a metallic state can
happen through the closing of the energy gap in the molecular solid or through
a transition to an atomic solid. Recent experiments have managed to reach
pressures in the range of 400-500 GPa, providing valuable insights. There is
strong evidence suggesting that metallization via either of these mechanisms
occurs within this pressure range. Computational and experimental studies have
identified multiple promising crystal phases, but the limited accuracy of
calculations and the limited capabilities of experiments prevent us from
determining unequivocally the observed phase or phases. Therefore, it is
crucial to investigate the superconducting properties of all the candidate
phases. Recently, we reported the superconducting properties of the C2/c-24,
Cmca-12, Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases, including anharmonic effects. Here, we
report the effects of anisotropy on superconducting properties using Eliashberg
theory. Then, we investigate the superconducting properties of deuterium and
estimate the size of the isotope effect for each phase. We find that the
isotope effect on superconductivity is diminished by anharmonicity in the
C2/c-24 and Cmca-12 phases and enlarged in the Cmca-4 and I41/amd-2 phases. Our
anharmonic calculations of the C2/c-24 phase of deuterium agree closely with
the most recent experiment by Loubeyre et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 29, 035501
(2022)], indicating that the C2/c-24 phase remains the leading candidate in
this pressure range, and has a strong anharmonic character. These
characteristics can serve to distinguish among crystal phases in experiment.

<h3>Photoinduced Anomalous Supercurrent Hall Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03314" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03314</a>
<br>
<i>A. V.Parafilo, V. M. Kovalev, I. G. Savenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We predict a photoinduced Hall effect in an isotropic conventional
two-dimensional superconductor with a built-in supercurrent exposed to a
circularly-polarized light. This second-order with respect to the
electromagnetic field amplitude effect occurs when the frequency of the field
exceeds the double value of the superconducting gap. It reveals itself in the
emergence of a Cooper-pair condensate flow in the direction transverse to the
initial built-in supercurrent, which arises to compensate for the light-induced
electric current of quasiparticles photoexcited across the gap. The initial
supercurrent breaks both the time-reversal and inversion symmetries, while the
presence of dilute disorder in the sample provides the breaking of the Galilean
invariance. We develop a microscopic theory of the supercurrent Hall effect in
the case of weak disorder and show, that the Hall supercurrent is directly
proportional to the quasiparticle recombination time, which can acquire large
values.

<h3>Robust atmospherically stable hybrid SrVO3/Graphene//SrTiO3 template for  fast and facile large-area transfer of complex oxides onto Si</h3>

<br>
<br>
Heterogenous integration of complex epitaxial oxides onto Si and other target
substrates is recently gaining traction. One of the popular methods involves
growing a water-soluble and highly reactive sacrificial buffer layer, such as
Sr3Al2O6 (SAO) at the interface, and a functional oxide on top of this. To
improve the versatility of layer transfer techniques, it is desired to utilize
stable (less reactive) sacrificial layers, without compromising on the transfer
rates. In this study, we utilized a combination of chemical vapor deposited
(CVD) graphene as a 2D material at the interface and pulsed laser deposited
(PLD) water-soluble SrVO3 (SVO) as a sacrificial buffer layer. We show that the
graphene layer enhances the dissolution rate of SVO over ten times without
compromising its atmospheric stability. We demonstrate the versatility of our
hybrid template by growing ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) via PLD and Pb(Zr, Ti)O3
(PZT) via Chemical Solution Deposition (CSD) technique and transferring them
onto the target substrates and establishing their ferroelectric properties. Our
hybrid templates allow for the realization of the potential of complex oxides
in a plethora of device applications for MEMS, electro-optics, and flexible
electronics.

<h3>Absence of logarithmic enhancement in the entanglement scaling of free  fermions on folded cubes</h3>

This study investigates the scaling behavior of the ground-state entanglement
entropy in a model of free fermions on folded cubes. An analytical expression
is derived in the large-diameter limit, revealing a strict adherence to the
area law. The absence of the logarithmic enhancement expected for free fermions
is explained using a decomposition of folded cubes in chains based on its
Terwilliger algebra and $\mathfrak{so}(3)_{-1}$. The entanglement Hamiltonian
and its relation to Heun operators are also investigated.

<h3>Interacting topological magnons in a checkerboard ferromagnet</h3>

<br>
<i>Heng Zhu, Hongchao Shi, Zhengguo Tang, Bing Tang</i>
<br>
<br>
This work is devoted to studying the magnon-magnon interaction effect in a
two-dimensional checkerboard ferromagnet with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. By means of the first-order Green function formalism, the
influence of magnon-magnon interaction on the magnon band topology is analyzed.
In order to verify that the gap-closing phenomenon is a signature for the
topological phase transitions of the checkerboard ferromagnet, we display that
the Chern numbers of renormalized magnon bands are distinct above and below the
critical temperature. Our results show that the checkerboard ferromagnet
possesses two topological phases and its topological phase can be controlled
either by the temperature or applied magnetic field due to magnon-magnon
interactions. Interestingly, we find that the topological phase transition
occurs twice with the increase of the temperature, which is different from the
result of the honeycomb ferromagnet.

<h3>Valley-Selective Phonon-Magnon Scattering in Magnetoelastic  Superlattices</h3>

Phonons and magnons are engineered by periodic potential landscapes in
phononic and magnonic crystals, and their combined studies may enable valley
phonon transport tunable by the magnetic field. Through nonreciprocal surface
acoustic wave transmission, we demonstrate valley-selective phonon-magnon
scattering in magnetoelastic superlattices. The lattice symmetry and the
out-of-plane magnetization component control the sign of nonreciprocity. The
phonons in the valleys play a crucial role in generating nonreciprocal
transmission by inducing circularly polarized strains that couple with the
magnons. The transmission spectra show a nonreciprocity peak near a
transmission gap, matching the phononic band structure. Our results open the
way for manipulating valley phonon transport through periodically varying
magnon-phonon coupling.

<h3>Chiral odd Chern number lattice supersolidity with tunable unpaired  Majorana fermions in a Rydberg-dressed Fermi gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03375" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03375</a>
<br>
<i>Shuai Li, Rui Tian, Min Liu, Maksims Arzamasovs, Bo Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
There is growing interest to search the chiral Majorana fermions that could
arise as the quasi-particle edge state of a two-dimensional topological state
of matter. Here we propose a new platform, i.e., a two-dimensional chiral odd
Chern number lattice supersolid state, for supporting multiple number-tunable
chiral Majorana fermions from a single component Rydberg-dressed Fermi gas in
an optical lattice. The attractiveness of our idea rests on the fact that by
introducing the unveiled competition between two distinct length scales, i.e.,
lattice period and the distance of resonant Rydberg-dressing, can provide a new
way to manipulate the spatial dependence of both the strength and sign of the
effective Rydberg-dressed interaction. Such a designed effective interaction
turns out, can induce an unveiled odd Chern number lattice supersolid state,
which is confirmed by both the mean-field and Monte Carlo calculations.
Furthermore, we also find that the spontaneously formed density modulation
resulted from the discrete translational symmetry breaking provides a natural
way of tuning the system's topology arising from the superfluidity induced by
the $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. It thus provide an alternative way for
manipulating the chiral Majorana fermions, which would be useful in topological
quantum computation.

<h3>Microscopic analysis of relaxation behavior in nonlinear optical  conductivity of graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03392" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03392</a>
<br>
<i>Bristi Ghosh, Sushanta Dattagupta, Malay Bandyopadhyay</i>
<br>
<br>
We present here a general formulation for the interband dynamical optical
conductivity in the nonlinear regime of graphene in the presence of a quantum
bath comprising phonons and electrons. Our main focus is the relaxation
behavior of the quantum solid of graphene perturbed by an oscillatory electric
field. Considering the optical range of the frequency and a considerable amount
of the amplitude of the field, one can observe a nonlinear response by
formulating a quantum master equation of the density operator associated with
the Hamiltonian encapsulated in the form of a spin-Boson model of dissipative
quantum statistical mechanics. Mapping the valence and conduction states as the
eigenstates of the Pauli spin operators and utilizing the rotating wave
approximation to omit off-resonant terms, one can solve the rate equation for
the mean population of the conduction and valence states and the mixing matrix
elements between them. Our results reveal the nonlinear steady-state regime's
population inversion and interband coherence. It is characterized by a single
dimensionless parameter that is directly proportional to the incident field
strength and inversely proportional to the optical frequency. Our method is
also capable of calculating the nonlinear interband optical conductivity of
doped and gapped graphene at finite temperatures. The effects of different bath
spectra for phonons and electrons are examined in detail. Although our general
formulation can address a variety of nonequilibrium response of the two-band
system, it also facilitates a connection with phenomenological modeling of
nonlinear optical conductivity.

<h3>Magnetically and electrically controllable valley splittings in MXene  monolayers</h3>

The modulation of the valley structure in two-dimensional valley materials is
vital in the field of valleytronics. The multiferroicity provides possibility
for multiple modulations of the valley, including the magnetic and electric
means. Based on the first-principle calculations, we study the valley
properties and associated manipulations of multiferroic Co$_2$CF$_2$ monolayers
with different stacking patterns. Our calculations show that the Co$_2$CF$_2$
monolayer in the H$^{\prime}$ phase is a ferrovalley material, with sizable
valley splittings. By rotating the magnetization direction, the valley
splittings can be tuned for both the magnitude and sign. The electric field,
driving the reversal of the electric polarization, can also change the
magnitude of the valley splittings. Besides, a metastable T$^{\prime}$ phase
exhibits valley splittings as well, of which the magnitude and sign can be
simultaneously controlled by applied magnetic and electric fields. These
findings offer a practical way for realizing highly tunable valleys by
multiferroic couplings.

<br>
<br>
2D materials with high charge carrier mobility and tunable electronic band
gaps have attracted intense research effort for their potential use as active
components in nanoelectronics. 2D-conjugated polymers (2DCP) constitute a
promising sub-class due to the fact that the electronic band structure can be
manipulated by varying the molecular building blocks, while at the same time
preserving the key features of 2D materials such as Dirac cones and high charge
mobility. The major challenge for their use in technological applications is to
fabricate mesoscale ordered 2DCP networks since current synthetic routes yield
only small domains with a high density of defects. Here we demonstrate the
synthesis of a mesoscale ordered 2DCP with semiconducting properties and Dirac
cone structures via Ullmann coupling on Au(111). This material has been
obtained by combining rigid azatriangulene precursors and a hot dosing approach
which favours molecular diffusion and reduces the formation of voids in the
network. These results open opportunities for the synthesis of 2DCP Dirac cone
materials and their integration into devices.

The mode-coupling theory of the glass transition (MCT) has been at the
forefront of fundamental glass research for decades, yet the theory's
underlying approximations remain obscure. Here we quantify and critically
assess the effect of each MCT approximation separately. Using Brownian dynamics
simulations, we compute the memory kernel predicted by MCT after each
approximation in its derivation, and compare it with the exact one. We find
that some often-criticized approximations are in fact very accurate, while the
opposite is true for others, providing new guiding cues for further theory
development.

<h3>On chip AC driving for dual Shapiro steps</h3>

A single Josephson junction in the phase-slip regime exhibits Bloch
oscillations in the voltage when biased with a DC current $I_\text{DC}$. The
frequency of the oscillation is given by $\pi I_\text{DC}/e$, with $e$ the
elementary charge, linking the current to the frequency via fundamental
constants of nature. If an additional AC drive is applied, the Bloch
oscillations may synchronize with the external drive. This leads to the
emergence of dual Shapiro steps at fixed current in the $IV$ characteristics of
the device. For applications as a current standard, frequencies of the order of
10\,GHz are required. These are challenging to implement experimentally without
detrimental effects due to stray capacitances. Here, we propose to employ an
additional Josephson junction with a DC voltage bias as an on chip AC source
due to the AC Josephson effect. We study the back action of the Bloch
oscillations on the Josephson oscillations and identify a parameter regime in
which it is minimized. Furthermore, we find that the back action can even be
utilized to further enhance the driving signal which can lead to increased
widths of the resulting dual Shapiro steps. Finally, we show dual Shapiro steps
for a set of realistic experimental parameters at finite temperatures.

The boom of semiconductor quantum computing platforms created a demand for
computer-aided design and fabrication of quantum devices. Path integral Monte
Carlo (PIMC) can have an important role in this effort because it intrinsically
integrates strong quantum correlations that often appear in these
multi-electron systems. In this paper we present a PIMC algorithm that
estimates exchange interactions of three-dimensional electrically defined
quantum dots. We apply this model to silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)
devices and we benchmark our method against well-tested full configuration
interaction (FCI) simulations. As an application, we study the impact of a
single charge trap on two exchanging dots, opening the possibility of using
this code to test the tolerance to disorder of CMOS devices. This algorithm
provides an accurate description of this system, setting up an initial step to
integrate PIMC algorithms into development of semiconductor quantum computers.

<h3>Spectral properties of a mixed singlet-triplet Ising superconductor</h3>

Conventional two-dimensional superconductivity is destroyed when the critical
in-plane magnetic field exceeds the so-called Pauli limit. Some monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides lack inversion symmetry and the strong
spin-orbit coupling leads to a valley-dependent Zeeman-like spin splitting. The
resulting spin-valley locking lifts the valley degeneracy and results in a
strong enhancement of the in-plane critical magnetic field. In these systems,
it was predicted that the density of states in an in-plane field exhibits
distinct mirage gaps at finite energies of about the spin-orbit coupling
strength, which arise from a coupling of the electron and hole bands at energy
larger than the superconducting gap. In this study, we investigate the impact
of a triplet pairing channel on the spectral properties, primarily the mirage
gap and the superconducting gap, in the clean limit. Notably, in the presence
of the triplet pairing channel, the mirage-gap width is reduced for the low
magnetic fields. Furthermore, when the temperature is lower than the triplet
critical temperature, the mirage gaps survive even in the strong-field limit
due to the finite singlet and triplet order parameters. Our work provides
insights into controlling and understanding the properties of spin-triplet
Cooper pairs.

$\tau$-MnAl is interesting for spintronic applications as a ferromagnet with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy due to its high uniaxial magnetocrystalline
anisotropy. Here we report on the anomalous Nernst effect of sputter deposited
$\tau$-MnAl thin films. We demonstrate a robust anomalous Nernst effect at
temperatures of 200 K and 300 K with a hysteresis similar to the anomalous Hall
effect and the magnetisation of the material. The anomalous Nernst coefficient
of (0.6$\pm$0.24) $\mu$V/K at 300 K is comparable to other perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy thin films. Therefore $\tau$-MnAl is a promising candidate
for spin-caloritronic research.

Orbitronics is based on the use of orbit currents as information carriers. Up
to now, orbit currents were created from the conversion of charge or spin
currents, and inversely, they could be converted back to charge or spin
currents. Here we demonstrate that orbit currents can also be generated by
femtosecond light pulses on Ni. In multilayers associating Ni with oxides and
nonmagnetic metals such as Cu, we detect the orbit currents by their conversion
into charge currents and the resulting terahertz emission. We show that the
orbit currents extraordinarily predominate the light-induced spin currents in
Ni-based systems, whereas only spin currents can be detected with CoFeB-based
systems. In addition, the analysis of the time delays of the terahertz pulses
leads to relevant information on the velocity and propagation of orbit
carriers. Our finding of light-induced orbit currents and our observation of
their conversion into charge currents opens new avenues in orbitronics,
including the development of orbitronic terahertz devices.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) are
two key tools with which to probe the dynamic and static structure factor,
respectively, in soft matter. Usually DLS and SANS measurements are performed
separately, in different laboratories, on different samples and at different
times. However, this methodology has particular disadvantages for a large
variety of soft materials which exhibit high sensitivity to small changes in
fundamental parameters such as waiting times, concentration, pH, ionic
strength, etc. Here we report on a new portable DLS-SANS apparatus that allows
one to simultaneously measure both the microscopic dynamics (through DLS) and
the static structure (through SANS) on the same sample. The apparatus has been
constructed as a collaboration between two laboratories, each an expert in one
of the scattering methods, and was commissioned on the \textit{LOQ} and
\textit{ZOOM} SANS instruments at the ISIS Pulsed Neutron \& Muon Source, U.K.

Progress in magnetoelectric materials is hindered by apparently contradictory
requirements for time-reversal symmetry broken and polar ferroelectric
electronic structure in common ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Alternative
routes could be provided by recent discoveries of a time-reversal symmetry
breaking anomalous Hall effect in noncollinear magnets and altermagnets, but
hitherto reported bulk materials are not polar. Here, we report the observation
of a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in doped AgCrSe$_2$, a layered polar
semiconductor with an antiferromagnetic coupling between Cr spins in adjacent
layers. The anomalous Hall resistivity 3 $\mu\Omega$ cm is comparable to the
largest observed in compensated magnetic systems to date, and is rapidly
switched off when the angle of an applied magnetic field is rotated to $\sim
80^{\circ}$ from the crystalline $c$-axis. Our ionic gating experiments show
that the anomalous Hall conductivity magnitude can be enhanced by modulating
the $p$-type carrier density. We also present theoretical results that suggest
the anomalous Hall effect is driven by Berry curvature due to noncollinear
antiferromagnetic correlations among Cr spins, which are consistent with the
previously suggested magnetic ordering in AgCrSe$_2$. Our results open the
possibility to study the interplay of magnetic and ferroelectric-like responses
in this fascinating class of materials.

<h3>Quantum spin liquid in the easy-axis Heisenberg model on frustrated  lattices</h3>

So far quantum spin liquids have been mostly considered within the isotropic
(or close to isotropic) Heisenberg models on frustrated lattices. Recently,
such a state has been found experimentally in highly anisotropic easy-axis
effective-spin-1/2 compound NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ featuring a perfect triangular
lattice. Performing a numerical calculation of thermodynamic quantities on
systems with up to 36 sites in the corresponding spin model, we confirm the
transition from an ordered magnetic state in the isotropic case, into the
quantum spin-liquid state in the easy-axis regime, whereby the clearest
signature is the vanishing generalized Wilson ratio. On the other hand, the
same model on the kagome lattice reveals spin-liquid properties in the whole
anisotropy regime.

<h3>Investigation about the electrochemical reduction in 3YSZ, related phase  transition and consequences</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this research the electrochemical reduction of 3YSZ was investigated in
various atmospheres with different oxygen partial pressures under an electric
field of 25 V/cm at an environmental temperature of 800 {\deg}C. At a certain
oxygen partial pressure insufficient incorporation of oxygen in the sample led
to electrochemical reduction of YSZ which shows two clearly distinguishable
states. First, greying of the material without a significant change in
properties was detected which then transitioned into a second stage where a
fundamental phase transition in the material happened within seconds from
tetragonal 3YSZ towards FCC rocksalt ZrO or ZrON, dependent on the atmosphere.
This phase transition is accompanied by blackening of the material, sudden
increase in electrical conductivity, current concentration, and an obvious
change in Raman spectrum.

We revisit the approach to the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ in the
Ising-like $\varphi^4$ theory within the functional renormalization group by
studying the lowest approximation levels in the derivative expansion of the
effective average action. Our goal is to assess how the latter, which provides
a generic approximation scheme valid across dimensions and found to be accurate
in $d\geq 2$, is able to capture the long-distance physics associated with the
expected proliferation of localized excitations near $d_{\rm lc}$. We show that
the convergence of the fixed-point effective potential is nonuniform when $d\to
d_{\rm lc}$ with the emergence of a boundary layer around the minimum of the
potential. This allows us to make analytical predictions for the value of the
lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ and for the behavior of the critical
temperature as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$, which are both found in fair agreement with
the known results. This confirms the versatility of the theoretical approach.

<h3>Long time rigidity to flux-induced symmetry breaking: A Tsunami effect  in quantum quench dynamics</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigate how the breaking of charge conjugation symmetry $\mathcal{C}$
impacts on the dynamics of a half-filled fermionic lattice system after global
quenches. We show that, when the initial state is insulating and the
$\mathcal{C}$-symmetry is broken non-locally by a constant magnetic flux, local
observables and correlations behave as if the symmetry were unbroken for a time
interval proportional to the system size $L$. In particular, the local particle
density of a quenched dimerized insulator remains pinned to $1/2$ in each
lattice site for an extensively long time, while it starts to significantly
fluctuate only afterwards. We dub this phenomenon the ``Tsunami effect".
Notably, it occurs even though the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken right
after the quench. Furthermore, we identify a way to quantify the amount of
symmetry breaking in the quantum state, showing that in insulators perturbed by
a flux it is exponentially suppressed as a function of the system size, while
it is only algebraically suppressed in metals and in insulators with locally
broken $\mathcal{C}$-symmetry. The robustness of the Tsunami effect to weak
disorder and interactions is demonstrated, and possible experimental
realizations are proposed.

<h3>Unified framework for hybrid percolation transitions based on  microscopic dynamics</h3>

<br>
<br>
A hybrid percolation transition (HPT) exhibits both discontinuity of the
order parameter and critical behavior at the transition point. Such dynamic
transitions can occur in two ways: by cluster pruning with suppression of loop
formation of cut links or by cluster merging with suppression of the creation
of large clusters. While the microscopic mechanism of the former is understood
in detail, a similar framework is missing for the latter. By studying two
distinct cluster merging models, we uncover the universal mechanism of the
features of HPT-s at a microscopic level. We find that these features occur in
three steps: (i) medium-sized clusters accumulate due to the suppression rule
hindering the growth of large clusters, (ii) those medium size clusters
eventually merge and a giant cluster increases rapidly, and (iii) the
suppression effect becomes obsolete and the kinetics is governed by the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi type of dynamics. We show that during the second and third
period, the growth of the largest component must proceed in the form of a
Devil's staircase. We characterize the critical behavior by two sets of
exponents associated with the order parameter and cluster size distribution,
which are related to each other by a scaling relation. Extensive numerical
simulations are carried out to support the theory where a specific method is
applied for finite-size scaling analysis to enable handling the large
fluctuations of the transition point. Our results provide a unified theoretical
framework for the HPT.

Polarization dynamics and domain structure evolution in ferroelectric
Al$_{0.93}$B$_{0.07}$N are studied using piezoresponse force microscopy and
spectroscopies in ambient and controlled atmosphere environments. The
application of negative unipolar, and bipolar first-order reverse curve (FORC)
waveforms leads to a protrusion-like feature on the Al$_{0.93}$B$_{0.07}$N
surface and reduction of electromechanical response due to electrochemical
reactivity. A surface change is also observed on the application of fast
alternating current bias. At the same time, the application of positive biases
does not lead to surface changes. Comparatively in a controlled glove box
atmosphere, stable polarization patterns can be observed, with minuscule
changes in surface morphology. This surface morphology change is not isolated
to applying biases to free surface, a similar topographical change is also
observed at the electrode edges when cycling a capacitor in ambient
environment. The study suggests that surface electrochemical reactivity may
have a significant impact on the functionality of this material in the ambient
environment. However, even in the controlled atmosphere, the participation of
the surface ions in polarization switching phenomena and ionic compensation is
possible.

Silicon nanowires have attracted considerable interest due to their
wide-ranging applications in nanoelectromechanical systems and nanoelectronics.
Molecular dynamics simulations are powerful tools for studying the mechanical
properties of nanowires. However, these simulations encounter challenges in
interpreting the mechanical behavior and brittle to ductile transition of
silicon nanowires, primarily due to surface effects such as the assumption of
an unreconstructed surface state. This study specifically focuses on the
tensile deformation of silicon nanowires with a native oxide layer, considering
critical parameters such as cross-sectional shape, length-to-critical dimension
ratio, temperature, the presence of nano-voids, and strain rate. By
incorporating the native oxide layer, the article aims to provide a more
realistic representation of the mechanical behavior for different critical
dimensions and crystallographic orientations of silicon nanowires. The findings
contribute to the advancement of knowledge regarding size-dependent elastic
properties and strength of silicon nanowires.

The SU(3) Haldane phase with adjoint representation provides the simplest
non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phases in the SU($N>2$) spin chains
for which a gapped system has been predicted. In this letter, I show how to
realize this phase in a two-species spinor Bose gas. The proposed system
consists of two intertwined species-dependent zigzag optical lattices with the
two species labeling the quark and antiquark states of SU(3) symmetry. The
Haldane phase is found connected to a position at which both the string order
and entanglement spectrum degeneracy are absent, signaling the appearance of a
critical point. I show how to understand this absence by a ground-state ansatz.

The numerical renormalization group (NRG) has been widely used as a magnetic
impurity solver since the pioneering works by Wilson. Over the past decades, a
significant attention has been focused on the application of symmetries in
order to reduce the computational cost of the calculations and to improve their
accuracy. In particular, a notable progress has been made in implementing
continuous symmetries such as $SO(3)$, useful for studying impurities in an
isotropic medium, or $SU(N)$, which is applicable to a wide range of systems.
In this work, we focus on the application of discrete point group symmetries,
which are particularly relevant for impurity systems in metals where crystal
field effects are important. With this aim, we have developed an original NRG
code written in the Julia language, PointGroupNRG, where we have implemented
crystal point-group symmetries for the Anderson impurity model, as well as the
continuous spin and charge symmetries. Among other results, we demonstrate the
advantage of our procedure by performing thermodynamic calculations for an
impurity system with two orbitals of $E_g$ symmetry and two channels. We
compare the results with those obtained for an approximate equivalent model
with continuous orbital symmetry.

<br>
As a promising alternative to the Von Neumann architecture, in-memory
computing holds the promise of delivering high computing capacity while
consuming low power. Content addressable memory (CAM) can implement pattern
matching and distance measurement in memory with massive parallelism, making
them highly desirable for data-intensive applications. In this paper, we
propose and demonstrate a novel 1-transistor-per-bit CAM based on the
ferroelectric reconfigurable transistor. By exploiting the switchable polarity
of the ferroelectric reconfigurable transistor, XOR/XNOR-like matching
operation in CAM can be realized in a single transistor. By eliminating the
need for the complementary circuit, these non-volatile CAMs based on
reconfigurable transistors can offer a significant improvement in area and
energy efficiency compared to conventional CAMs. NAND- and NOR-arrays of CAMs
are also demonstrated, which enable multi-bit matching in a single reading
operation. In addition, the NOR array of CAM cells effectively measures the
Hamming distance between the input query and stored entries. Furthermore,
utilizing the switchable polarity of these ferroelectric Schottky barrier
transistors, we demonstrate reconfigurable logic gates with NAND/NOR dual
functions, whose input-output mapping can be transformed in real-time without
changing the layout. These reconfigurable circuits will serve as important
building blocks for high-density data-stream processors and reconfigurable
Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (r-ASICs). The CAMs and transformable
logic gates based on ferroelectric reconfigurable transistors will have broad
applications in data-intensive applications from image processing to machine
learning and artificial intelligence.

<h3>Tilt-induced clustering of cell adhesion proteins</h3>

<br>
<br>
Cell adhesion proteins are transmembrane proteins that bind cells to their
environment. These proteins typically cluster into disk-shaped or linear
structures. Here we show that such clustering patterns spontaneously emerge
when the protein sense the membrane deformation gradient, for example by
reaching a lower-energy conformation when the membrane is tilted relative to
the underlying binding substrate. Increasing the strength of the membrane
gradient-sensing mechanism first yields isolated disk-shaped clusters and then
long linear structures. Our theory is coherent with experimental estimates,
suggesting that a tilt-induced clustering mechanism is relevant in the context
of cell adhesion proteins.

Granular media are soft matter systems that exhibit some of the extreme

<h3>Counterion-controlled phase equilibria in a charge-regulated polymer  solution</h3>

<br>
<i>Giulia L. Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Münch, Barbara Wagner</i>
<br>
<br>
We study phase equilibria in a minimal model of charge-regulated polymer
solutions. Our model consists of a single polymer species whose charge state
arises from protonation-deprotonation processes in the presence of a dissolved
acid, whose anions serve as screening counterions. We explicitly account for
variability in the polymers' charge states. Homogeneous equilibria in this
model system are characterised by the total concentration of polymers, the
concentration of counter-ions and the charge distributions of polymers which
can be computed with the help of analytical approximations. We use these
analytical results to characterise how parameter values and solution acidity
influence equilibrium charge distributions and identify for which regimes
uni-modal and multi-modal charge distributions arise. We then study the
interplay between charge regulation, solution acidity and phase separation. We
find that charge regulation has a significant impact on polymer solubility and
allows for non-linear responses to the solution acidity: re-entrant phase
behaviour is possible in response to increasing solution acidity. Moreover, we
show that phase separation can yield to the coexistence of local environments
characterised by different charge distributions and mixture compositions.

<h3>Different fractional charges from auto- and cross-correlation noise in  quantum Hall states without upstream modes</h3>

Fractional charges of anyons can be extracted from shot noise in two ways.
One can use either the auto-correlation noise of the current in one drain or
the cross-correlation noise between two drains on the two sides of the device.
The former approach typically overestimates the charge. This may happen due to
upstream edge modes. We propose a mechanism for the excess auto-correlation
noise without upstream modes. It applies to systems with multiple
co-propagating edge modes and assumes that the noise is measured at a low but
non-zero frequency.

<br>
<i>Samuel E. Begg, Ryo Hanai</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the impact of non-reciprocity on universality and critical
phenomena in open quantum systems. Non-reciprocal open quantum systems often
have an exotic spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the
Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). By considering an open quantum XXZ spin chain
that exhibits LSE, we demonstrate the existence of a universal scaling regime
that is not affected by the presence of the LSE. We resolve the critical
exponents, which differ from those of free fermions, via tensor network methods
and demonstrate that observables exhibit a universal scaling collapse,
irrespective of the reciprocity. We find that the LSE only becomes relevant
when a healing length scale $\xi_{\rm heal}$ at the system's edge (which is
different to the localization length of the eigenstate of the Liouvillian)
exceeds the system size, allowing edge properties to dominate the physics. We
expect this result to be a generic feature of non-reciprocal models in the
vicinity of a critical point.

<h3>Modeling intercalation chemistry with multi-redox reactions by sparse  lattice models in disordered rocksalt cathodes</h3>

<i>Peichen Zhong, Fengyu Xie, Luis Barroso-Luque, Liliang Huang, Gerbrand Ceder</i>
<br>
<br>
Modern battery materials can contain many elements with substantial site
disorder, and their configurational state has been shown to be critical for
their performance. The intercalation voltage profile is a critical parameter to
evaluate the performance of energy storage. The application of commonly used
cluster expansion techniques to model the intercalation thermodynamics of such
systems from \textit{ab-initio} is challenged by the combinatorial increase in
configurational degrees of freedom as the number of species grows. Such
challenges necessitate efficient generation of lattice models without
over-fitting and proper sampling of the configurational space under charge
balance in ionic systems. In this work, we introduce a combined approach that
addresses these challenges by (1) constructing a robust cluster-expansion
Hamiltonian using the sparse regression technique, including
$\ell_0\ell_2$-norm regularization and structural hierarchy; and (2)
implementing semigrand-canonical Monte Carlo to sample charge-balanced ionic
configurations using the table-exchange method and an ensemble-average
approach. These techniques are applied to a disordered rocksalt oxyfluoride
Li$_{1.3-x}$Mn$_{0.4}$Nb$_{0.3}$O$_{1.6}$F$_{0.4}$ (LMNOF) which is part of a
family of promising earth-abundant cathode materials. The simulated voltage
profile is found to be in good agreement with experimental data and
particularly provides a clear demonstration of the Mn and oxygen contribution
to the redox potential as a function of Li content.

<br>
<i>Xiaodong Guo, Xiaokang Li, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia</i>
<br>
<br>
Whenever two irreversible processes occur simultaneously, time-reversal
symmetry of microscopic dynamics gives rise, on a macroscopic level, to
Onsager's reciprocal relations, which impose constraints on the number of
independent components of any transport coefficient tensor. Here, we show that
in the antiferromagnetic YbMnBi$_2$, which displays a strong
temperature-dependent anisotropy, the Onsager's reciprocal relations are
strictly satisfied for anomalous electric, $\sigma^A_{ij}$, and anomalous
thermoelectric, $\alpha^A_{ij}$, conductivity tensors. In contradiction with
what was recently reported by Pan \textit{et al.} \cite{pan2022giant}, we find
that $\sigma^A_{ij} (H)= \sigma^A_{ji} (-H)$, and $\alpha^A_{ij} (H)=
\alpha^A_{ji} (-H)$. This equality holds in the whole temperature window
irrespective of the relative weights of the intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms.
The $\alpha^A_{ij}/\sigma^A_{ij}$ ratio is close $k_B/e$ at room temperature,
but peaks to an unprecedented magnitude of 2.9 $k_B/e$ at $\sim$ 150 K, which
may involve non-degenerate carriers of small Fermi surface pockets.

<h3>Dissipative preparation of a Floquet topological insulator in an optical  lattice via bath engineering</h3>

<i>Alexander Schnell, Christof Weitenberg, André Eckardt</i>
<br>
<br>
Floquet engineering is an important tool for realizing topologically
nontrivial band structures for charge-neutral atoms in optical lattices.
However, the preparation of a topological-band-insulator-type state of
fermions, with one nontrivial quasi-energy band filled completely and the
others empty, is challenging as a result of both driving induced heating as
well as imperfect adiabatic state preparation (with the latter induced by the
unavoidable gap closing when passing the topological transition). An
alternative procedure that has been proposed is to prepare such states
dissipatively, i.e. as a steady state that emerges when coupling the system to
reservoirs. Here we discuss a concrete scheme that couples the system to a
weakly interacting Bose-condensate given by second atomic species acting as a
heat bath. Our strategy relies on the engineering of the potential for the bath
particles, so that they occupy weakly coupled tubes perpendicular to the
two-dimensional system. Using Floquet-Born-Markov theory, we show that the
resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the driven-dissipative system
approximates a topological insulator. We even find indications for the
approximate stabilization of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator, a
state that is impossible to realize in equilibrium.
