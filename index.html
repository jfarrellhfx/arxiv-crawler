<h3>Exciton Dynamics and Time-Resolved Fluorescence in Nanocavity-Integrated  Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15470" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15470</a>
<br>
<i>Kewei Sun, Kaijun Shen, Maxim F. Gelin, Yang Zhao</i>
<br>
<br>
We have developed an ab-initio-based fully-quantum numerically-accurate
methodology for the simulation of the exciton dynamics and time- and
frequency-resolved fluorescence spectra of the cavity-controlled
two-dimensional materials at finite temperature and applied this methodology to
the single-layer WSe2 system. This allowed us to establish dynamical and
spectroscopic signatures of the polaronic and polaritonic effects as well as
uncover their characteristic timescales in the relevant range of temperatures.

<h3>Simulation of emission spectra of transition-metal dichalcogenide  monolayers with the multimode Brownian oscillator model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15475" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15475</a>
<br>
<i>Kaijun Shen, Kewei Sun, Yang Zhao</i>
<br>
<br>
The multimode Brownian oscillator model is employed to simulate the emission
spectra of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. Good agreement is
obtained between measured and simulated photoluminescence spectra of WSe2, WS2,
MoSe2 and MoS2 at various temperatures. The Huang-Rhys factor extracted from
the model can be associated with that from the modified semi-empirical Varshni
equation at high temperatures. Individual mechanisms leading to the unique
temperature-dependent emission spectra of those TMDs are validated by the MBO
fitting, while it is in turn confirmed that the MBO analysis is an effective
method for studying the optical properties of TMD monolayers. Parameters
extractd from the MBO fitting can be used to explore exciton-photon-phonon
dynamics of TMDs in a more comprehensive model.

<h3>Transient hygro- and hydro-expansion of freely and restrained dried  paper: the fiber-network coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15480" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15480</a>
<br>
<i>N.H. Vonk, W.P.C. van Spreuwel, T. Anijs, R.H.J. Peerlings, M.G.D. Geers, J.P.M. Hoefnagels</i>
<br>
<br>
The transient dimensional changes during \textit{hygro}-expansion and
\textit{hydro}-expansion of freely and restrained dried, softwood and hardwood
sheets and fibers is monitored, to unravel the governing micro-mechanisms
occurring during gradual water saturation. The response of individual fibers is
measured using a full-field global digital height correlation method, which has
been extended to monitor the transient \textit{hydro}-expansion of fibers from
dry to fully saturated. The \textit{hygro}- and \textit{hydro}-expansion is
larger for freely versus restrained dried and softwood versus hardwood
handsheets. The transient sheet-scale \textit{hydro}-expansion reveals a sudden
strain and moisture content step. It is postulated that the driving mechanism
is the moisture-induced softening of the so-called "dislocated regions" in the
fiber's cellulose micro-fibrils, unlocking further fiber swelling. The strain
step is negligible for restrained dried handsheets, which is attributed to the
"dislocated cellulose regions" being locked in their stretched configuration
during restrained drying, which is supported by the single fiber
\textit{hydro}-expansion measurements. Finally, an inter-fiber bond model is
exploited and adapted to predict the sheet-scale \textit{hygro}-expansion from
the fiber level characteristics. The model correctly predicts the qualitative
differences between freely versus restrained dried and softwood versus hardwood
handsheets, yet, its simplified geometry does not allow for more quantitative
predictions of the sheet-scale \textit{hydro}-expansion.

<br>
<h3>Effect of restrained versus free drying on hygro-expansion of hardwood  and softwood fibers and paper handsheet</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15481" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15481</a>
<br>
<i>N.H. Vonk, R.H.J. Peerlings, M.G.D. Geers, J.P.M. Hoefnagels</i>
<br>
<br>
Earlier works in literature on the hygro-expansion of paper state that the
larger hygro-expansivity of freely compared to restrained dried handsheets is
due to structural differences between the fibers inside the handsheet. To
unravel this hypothesis, first, the hygro-expansion of freely and restrained
dried, hardwood and softwood handsheets has been characterized. Subsequently,
the transient full-field hygro-expansion (longitudinal, transverse, and shear
strain) of fibers extracted from these handsheets was measured using global
digital height correlation, from which the micro-fibril angle was deduced. The
hygro-expansivity of each individual fiber was tested before and after a
wetting period, during which the fiber's moisture content is maximized, to
analyze if a restrained dried fiber can "transform" into a freely dried fiber.
It was found that the longitudinal hygro-expansion of the freely dried fibers
is significantly larger than the restrained dried fibers, consistent with the
sheet-scale differences. The difference in micro-fibril angle between the
freely and restrained dried fibers is a possible explanation for this
difference, but merely for the hardwood fibers, which are able to "transform"
to freely dried fibers after being soaked in water. In contrast, this
"transformation" does not happen in softwood fibers, even after full immersion
in water for a day. Various mechanisms have been studied to explain the
observations on freely and restrained dried hardwood and softwood, fiber and
handsheets including analysis of the fibers' lumen and cross-sectional shape.
The presented results and discussion deepens the understanding of the
differences between freely and restrained dried handsheets.

<h3>Towards a Ginzburg-Landau theory of the quantum geometric effect in  superconductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15504" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15504</a>
<br>
<i>Shuai A. Chen, K. T. Law</i>
<br>
<br>
Superconductivity in flat-band systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene,
exhibits unconventional behaviours which cannot be described by the BCS theory.
In this work, we derive an effective Lagrangian from a microscopic flat-band
Hamiltonian which allows us to establish a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory that
includes the quantum geometric effects in flat-band superconductors. First of
all, we deduce the critical temperature of a flat-band superconductor within
the mean-field description which is determined by the quantum metric. Secondly,
going beyond the mean-field approximation by taking into account the
fluctuations of the order parameter, we determine the superfluid weight,
superconducting coherent length, and the upper critical field and their
dependence on the quantum metric of the flat bands. Thirdly, we apply the GL to
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). By calculating the quantum metric of flat bands
of TBG, the GL theory allows the estimation of the superconducting coherence
length and the upper critical field. The results of the superconducting
coherence length and upper critical field match the experimental results
incredibly well without the fine tuning of parameters. The GL theory with
quantum metric provides a new and general theoretical understanding of
unconventional behaviors of flat-band superconductors.

<h3>Magic Angles In Equal-Twist Trilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15505</a>
<br>
<i>Fedor K. Popov, Grigory Tarnopolsky</i>
<br>
<br>
We consider a configuration of three stacked graphene monolayers with equal
consecutive twist angles $\theta$. Remarkably, in the chiral limit when
interlayer coupling terms between $\textrm{AA}$ sites of the moir\'{e} pattern
are neglected we find four perfectly flat bands (for each valley) at a sequence
of magic angles which are exactly equal to the twisted bilayer graphene (TBG)
magic angles divided by $\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the first magic angle for
equal-twist trilayer graphene (eTTG) in the chiral limit is $\theta_{*} \approx
1.05^{\circ}/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.74^{\circ}$. We prove this relation
analytically and show that the Bloch states of the eTTG's flat bands are
non-linearly related to those of TBG's. Additionally, we show that at the magic
angles, the upper and lower bands must touch the four exactly flat bands at the
Dirac point of the middle graphene layer. Finally, we explore the eTTG's
spectrum away from the chiral limit through numerical analysis.

<h3>Mixed-state long-range order and criticality from measurement and  feedback</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15507" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15507</a>
<br>
<i>Tsung-Cheng Lu, Zhehao Zhang, Sagar Vijay, Timothy H. Hsieh</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a general framework for using local measurements, local unitaries,
and non-local classical communication to construct quantum channels which can
efficiently prepare mixed states with long-range quantum order or quantum
criticality. As an illustration, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases
can be universally converted into mixed-states with long-range entanglement,
which can undergo phase transitions with quantum critical correlations of local
operators and a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement negativity, despite
coexisting with volume-law entropy. Within the same framework, we present two
applications using fermion occupation number measurement to convert (i) spinful
free fermions in one dimension into a quantum-critical mixed state with
enhanced algebraic correlations between spins and (ii) Chern insulators into a
mixed state with critical quantum correlations in the bulk. The latter is an
example where mixed-state quantum criticality can emerge from a gapped state of
matter in constant depth using local quantum operations and non-local classical
communication.

<h3>Static and dynamical magnetic properties of the extended  Kitaev-Heisenberg model with spin vacancies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15526" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15526</a>
<br>
<i>Shaozhi Li, Randy S. Fishman, Tom Berlijn</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the potential to suppress the antiferromagnetic long-range order
in favor of the long-sought-after Kitaev quantum spin liquid state, we study
the effect of spin vacancies in the extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model. In
particular, we focus on a realistic model obtained from fitting inelastic
neutron scattering on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We observe that the long-range zigzag
magnetic ordered state only survives when the doping concentration is smaller
than 5\%. Upon further increasing the spin vacancy concentration, the ground
state becomes a short-range ordered state at low temperatures. Compared with
experiments, our classical solution over-stabilizes the zigzag correlation in
the presence of spin vacancies. Our theoretical results provide guidance toward
interpreting inelastic neutron scattering experiments on magnetically diluted
Kitaev candidate materials.

<h3>GlassNet: a multitask deep neural network for predicting many glass  properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15538" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15538</a>
<br>
<i>Daniel R. Cassar</i>
<br>
<br>
A multitask deep neural network model was trained on more than 218k different
glass compositions. This model, called GlassNet, can predict 85 different
properties (such as optical, electrical, dielectric, mechanical, and thermal
properties, as well as density, viscosity/relaxation, crystallization, surface
tension, and liquidus temperature) of glasses and glass-forming liquids of
different chemistries (such as oxides, chalcogenides, halides, and others). The
model and the data used to train it are available in the GlassPy Python module
as free and open source software for the community to use and build upon. As a
proof of concept, GlassNet was used with the MYEGA viscosity equation to
predict the temperature dependence of viscosity and outperformed another
general purpose viscosity model available in the literature (ViscNet) on unseen
data. An explainable AI algorithm (SHAP) was used to extract knowledge
correlating the input (physicochemical information) and output (glass
properties) of the model, providing valuable insights for glass manufacturing
and design. It is hoped that GlassNet, with its free and open source nature,
can be used to enable faster and better computer-aided design of new
technological glasses.

<h3>Ground state phase diagram and superconductivity of the doped Hubbard  model on six-leg square cylinders</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15541" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15541</a>
<br>
<i>Yi-Fan Jiang, Thomas P. Devereaux, Hong-Chen Jiang</i>
<br>
<br>
We have studied the ground state properties of Hubbard model on long six-leg
square cylinders with doped hole concentration per site $5.55\% \leq \delta\leq
12.5\%$ using density-matrix renormalization group. By keeping a large number
of states for long system sizes, we find that the nature of the ground state is
remarkably sensitive to the presence of next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping
$t'$. In the positive $t'$ side, we find a robust $d$-wave superconducting (SC)
phase characterized by coexisting quasi-long-range SC and charge density wave
(CDW) correlations. Without $t'$ the ground state forms an insulating stripe
phase with long-range CDW order but short-range spin-spin and SC correlations.
In stark contrast to four-leg cylinders, our results show that the lightly
doped Hubbard model on six-leg cylinders remains insulating in the negative
$t'$ side where the SC correlations decay exponentially with short correlation
lengths. In the larger negative $t'$ side, the doped holes form a novel holon
Wigner crystal with one doped hole per emergent unit cell and short-range
spin-spin correlations.

<h3>Wide-range continuous tuning of the thermal conductivity of $\rm  La_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}CoO_{3-δ}$ films via room-temperature ion-gel gating</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15545" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15545</a>
<br>
<i>Yingying Zhang, William M. Postiglione, Rui Xie, Chi Zhang, Hao Zhou, Vipul Chaturvedi, Kei Heltemes, Hua Zhou, Tianli Feng, Chris Leighton, Xiaojia Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Solid-state control of the thermal conductivity of materials is of
exceptional interest for novel devices such as thermal diodes and switches.
Here, we demonstrate the ability to continuously tune the thermal conductivity
of nanoscale films of $\rm La_{0.5}Sr_{0.5}CoO_{3-\delta}$ (LSCO) by a factor
of over 5, via a room-temperature electrolyte-gate-induced non-volatile
topotactic phase transformation from perovskite (with $\delta \approx 0.1$) to
an oxygen-vacancy-ordered brownmillerite phase (with $\delta=0.5$), accompanied
by a metal-insulator transition. Combining time-domain thermoreflectance and
electronic transport measurements, model analyses based on molecular dynamics
and Boltzmann transport, and structural characterization by X-ray diffraction,
we uncover and deconvolve the effects of these transitions on heat carriers,
including electrons and lattice vibrations. The wide-range continuous
tunability of LSCO thermal conductivity enabled by low-voltage (below 4 V)
room-temperature electrolyte gating opens the door to non-volatile dynamic
control of thermal transport in perovskite-based functional materials, for
thermal regulation and management in device applications.

<h3>Electron-K-Phonon Interaction In Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15551" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15551</a>
<br>
<i>Chao-Xing Liu, Yulin Chen, Ali Yazdani, B. Andrei Bernevig</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop an analytic theory to describe the interaction between electrons
and K-phonons and study its influence on superconductivity in the bare bands of
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We find that, due to symmetry and the
two-center approximation, only one optical K-phonon (~ 160meV) of graphene is
responsible for inter-valley electron-phonon interaction. This phonon has
recently been found in angular-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy to be
responsible for replicas of the TBG flat bands. By projecting the interaction
to the TBG flat bands, we perform the full symmetry analysis of phonon-mediated
attractive interaction and pairing channels in the Chern basis, and show that
several channels are guaranteed to have gapless order parameters. From the
linearized gap equations, we find that the highest Tc pairing induced by this
phonon is a singlet gapped s-wave inter-Chern-band order parameter, followed
closely by a gapless nematic d-wave intra-Chern-band order parameter. We
justify these results analytically, using the topological heavy fermion mapping
of TBG which has allowed us to obtain an analytic form of phonon-mediated
attractive interaction and to analytically solve the linearized and T=0 gap
equations. For the intra-Chern-band channel, the nematic state with nodes is
shown to be stabilized in the chiral flat band limit. While the flat band
Coulomb interaction can be screened sufficiently enough - around Van-Hove
singularities - to allow for electron-phonon based superconductivity, it is
unlikely that this effect can be maintained in the lower density of states
excitation bands around the correlated insulator states.

<h3>Determination of III-V/Si absolute interface energies: impact on wetting  properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15566" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15566</a>
<br>
<i>L. Pedesseau, I. Lucci, S. Pallikkara Chandrasekharan, D. Gupta, C. Cornet</i>
<br>
<br>
Here, we quantitatively determine the impact of III-V/Si interface atomic
configuration on the wetting properties of the system. Based on a description
at the atomic scale using density functional theory, we first show that it is
possible to determine the absolute interface energies in heterogeneous
materials systems. A large variety of absolute GaP surface energies and GaP/Si
interface energies are then computed, confirming the large stability of charge
compensated III-V/Si interfaces with an energy as low as 23 meV/\r{A}$^{2}$.
While stable compensated III-V/Si interfaces are expected to promote complete
wetting conditions, it is found that this can be easily counterbalanced by the
substrate initial passivation, which favors partial wetting conditions.

<h3>Topological superconductors from a materials perspective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15581" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15581</a>
<br>
<i>Manasi Mandal, Nathan C. Drucker, Phum Siriviboon, Thanh Nguyen, Tiya Boonkird, Tej Nath Lamichhane, Ryotaro Okabe, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, Mingda Li</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological superconductors (TSCs) have garnered significant research and
industry attention in the past two decades. By hosting Majorana bound states
which can be used as qubits that are robust against local perturbations, TSCs
offer a promising platform toward (non-universal) topological quantum
computation. However, there has been a scarcity of TSC candidates, and the
experimental signatures that identify a TSC are often elusive. In this
perspective, after a short review of the TSC basics and theories, we provide an
overview of the TSC materials candidates, including natural compounds and
synthetic material systems. We further introduce various experimental
techniques to probe TSC, focusing on how a system is identified as a TSC
candidate, and why a conclusive answer is often challenging to draw. We
conclude by calling for new experimental signatures and stronger computational
support to accelerate the search for new TSC candidates.

<h3>Kibble-Zurek mechanism with time-averaged work</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15609</a>
<br>
<i>Pierre Nazé</i>
<br>
<br>
Like many other thermally isolated systems performing an adiabatic driving
process, the quantum Ising chain presents an ill-defined decorrelation time. On
the other hand, Kibble-Zurek mechanism uses a heuristic relaxation time to
achieve its famous scaling. In previous work, a successful connection between
this relaxation time and the upper bound of the oscillatory decorrelation time
was made in the context of weak drivings. The problem however of having a
well-defined decorrelation time, derived from first principles, that describes
Kibble-Zurek mechanism is still open. A solution to this conundrum is proposed
here by measuring the work using the time-averaged relaxation function of the
system. This quantity offers a new and well-defined decorrelation time for
thermally isolated systems by turning them similarly into systems performing an
isothermal process. I recover with this the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in the
context of the finite-time and weak drivings, and new features in the context
of slowly-varying processes.

<h3>Structure, Stability and Superconductivity of N-doped Lutetium Hydrides  at kbar Pressures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15622</a>
<br>
<i>Katerina P. Hilleke, Xiaoyu Wang, Dongbao Luo, Nisha Geng, Busheng Wang, Eva Zurek</i>
<br>
<br>
The structure of the material responsible for the room temperature and near
ambient pressure superconductivity reported in an N-doped lutetium hydride
[Nature, 615, 244 (2023)] has not been conclusively determined. Herein, density
functional theory calculations are performed in an attempt to uncover what it
might be. Guided by a range of strategies including crystal structure
prediction and modifications of existing structure types, we present an array
of Lu-N-H phases that are dynamically stable at experimentally relevant
pressures. Although none of the structures found are thermodynamically stable,
and none are expected to remain superconducting above 17 K at 10 kbar, a number
of metallic compounds with fcc Lu lattices -- as suggested by the experimental
X-ray diffraction measurements of the majority phase -- are identified. The
system whose calculated equation of states matches best with that measured for
the majority phase is fluorite-type LuH2, whose 10 kbar superconducting
critical temperature was estimated to be 0.09 K using the Allen-Dynes modified
McMillan equation.

<h3>Refined Spin Wave Model and Multi-magnon Bound States in $Li_{2}CuO_{2}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15639</a>
<br>
<i>Eli Zoghlin, Matthew B. Stone, Stephen D. Wilson</i>
<br>
<br>
Here we report a study of the spin dynamics in the ferromagnetic chain
compound $Li_{2}CuO_{2}$. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements allow for
the spin Hamiltonian to be determined using a $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ $XXZ$-Heisenberg
spin chain model with weak inter-chain interactions. The primary exchange
parameters determined from our data are qualitatively consistent with those of
W. E. A. Lorentz et al. Europhys. Lett. 88, 37002 (2009), and our data allow
for the resolution of additional inter-chain exchange interactions. We also
observe the formation of two- and three-magnon bound states, stabilized by the
weak, Ising-like exchange anisotropy of the nearest-neighbor intra-chain
interaction. While the two-magnon bound state exists only in the magnetically
ordered phase of this material, the three-magnon state persists in a finite
temperature regime above $T_{N}$, indicating an unconventional character. Our
results establish $Li_{2}CuO_{2}$ as an experimental platform for the study of
exchange anisotropy-stabilized bound states in a ferromagnetic chain.

This study investigates a new hybrid method for solving the combinatorial
problem of optimizing fractional functions with 0-1 binary variables. The
method combines density matrix minimization (DMM), tabu search (TS), and the
Dinkelbach algorithm to optimize fractional functions. Although DMM alone did
not provide a sufficiently accurate solution, combining DMM with TS
significantly improved the accuracy.

<h3>Robust 3.7 V-Na$_{2/3}$[Cu$_{1/3}$Mn$_{2/3}$]O$_2$ Cathode for Na-ion  Batteries</h3>

<br>
<br>
Na-ion batteries (NIBs), which are recognized as a next-generation
alternative technology for energy storage, still suffer from commercialization
constraints due to the lack of low-cost, high-performance cathode materials.
Since our first discovery of Cu$^{3+}$/Cu$^{2+}$ electrochemistry in 2014,
numerous Cu-substituted/doped materials have been designed for NIBs. However
for almost ten years, the potential of Cu$^{3+}$/Cu$^{2+}$ electrochemistry has
been grossly underappreciated and normally regarded as a semielectrochemically
active redox. Here, we re-synthesized P2-Na$_{2/3}$[Cu$_{1/3}$Mn$_{2/3}$]O$_2$
and reinterpreted it as a high-voltage, cost-efficient, air-stable, long-life,
and high-rate cathode material for NIBs, which demonstrates a high operating
voltage of 3.7 V and a completely active Cu$^{3+}$/Cu$^{2+}$ redox reaction.
The 2.3 Ah cylindrical cells exhibit excellent cycling (93.1% capacity after
2000 cycles), high rate (97.2% capacity at 10C rate), good low-temperature
performance (86.6% capacity at -30$^\circ$C), and high safety, based on which,
a 56 V-11.5 Ah battery pack for E-bikes is successfully constructed, exhibiting
stable cycling (96.5% capacity at the 800th cycle) and a long driving distance
(36 km, tester weight 65 kg). This work offers a commercially feasible cathode
material for low-cost, high-voltage NIBs, paving the way for advanced NIBs in
power and stationary energy storage applications.

<h3>Giant magnetocaloric effect in magnets down to the monolayer limit</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15722" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15722</a>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional magnets could potentially revolutionize information
technology, but their potential application to cooling technology and
magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in a material down to the monolayer limit remain
unexplored. Herein, we reveal through multiscale calculations the existence of
giant MCE and its strain tunability in monolayer magnets such as CrX$_3$ (X=F,
Cl, Br, I), CrAX (A=O, S, Se; X=F, Cl, Br, I), and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The maximum
adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_\text{ad}^\text{max}$), maximum
isothermal magnetic entropy change, and specific cooling power in monolayer
CrF$_3$ are found as high as 11 K, 35 $\mu$Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, and 3.5

$a$-axis uniaxial compressive strain can remarkably increase $\Delta
T_\text{ad}^\text{max}$ of CrCl$_3$ and CrOF by 230% and 37% (up to 15.3 and
6.0 K), respectively. It is found that large net magnetic moment per unit area
favors improved MCE. These findings advocate the giant-MCE monolayer magnets,
opening new opportunities for magnetic cooling at nanoscale.

In order to understand the anti-site disorder effect on the anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) effect in alloys, $\rm{Fe}_{50}Co_{50}$ alloys were
studied in this work using the fully relativistic spin-polarized screened (KKR)
method. The anti-site effect was modeled by interchanging Fe and Co atoms and
treated by the coherent potential approximation (CPA). We find that the
anti-site disorder broadens the spectral function and decreases the
conductivity. Our work emphasizes that the absolute variations of resistivity
under magnetic moment rotation are less affected by atomic disorders. The
annealing procedure improves the AMR by reduction of the total resistivity. At
the same time, we also find that the fourth-order term in the angular dependent
resistivity becomes weaker when the disorder increases, resulting from
increased scattering of the states around the band-crossing.

Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composite (FRPC) parts are mostly made as laminates,
shells, or surfaces wound with 2D fiber patterns even after the emergence of
additive manufacturing. Making FRPC parts with embedded continuous fibers in 3D
is not reported previously even though topology optimization shows that such
designs are optimal. Earlier attempts in 3D fiber reinforcement have
demonstrated additively manufactured parts with channels into which fibers are
inserted. In this paper, we present 3D printing techniques along with a printer
developed for printing parts with continuous fibers that are spatially embedded
inside the matrix using a variant of vat photopolymerization. Multiple
continuous fibers are gradually steered as the part is built layer upon layer
instead of placing them inside channels made in the part. We show examples of
spatial fiber patterns and geometries built using the 3D printing techniques
developed in this work. We also test the parts for strength and illustrate the
importance of spatially embedding fibers in specific patterns.

We develop a general theory of flat-band ferromagnetism in the SU($N$)
Fermi-Hubbard model, which describes the behavior of $N$-component fermions
with SU($N$) symmetric interactions. We focus on the case where the
single-particle spectrum has a flat band and establish a necessary and
sufficient condition for the SU($N$) Hubbard model to exhibit ferromagnetism
when the number of particles is the same as the degeneracy. We show that the
occurrence of ferromagnetism is equivalent to the irreducibility of the
projection matrix onto the space of single-particle ground states. We also
demonstrate that this result can be exploited to establish a rigorous result
for the ferromagnetic SU($N$) Kondo lattice model with a flat band.
Specifically, we prove that when the SU($N$) Hubbard model is ferromagnetic,
the ferromagnetic SU($N$) Kondo lattice model with the same hopping matrix also
exhibits SU($N$) ferromagnetism.

We report about element specific measurements of ultrafast demagnetization
and magnetization precession damping in Permalloy (Py) thin films.
Magnetization dynamics induced by optical pump at $1.5$eV is probed
simultaneously at the $M_{2,3}$ edges of Ni and Fe with High order Harmonics
for moderate demagnetization rates (less than $50$%). The role of the
intersublattice exchange interaction on both longitudinal and transverse
dynamics is analyzed with a Landau Lifshitz Bloch description of
ferromagnetically coupled Fe and Ni sublattices. It is shown that the
intersublattice exchange interaction governs the dissipation during
demagnetization as well as precession damping of the magnetization vector.

<h3>L1$_0$ FePt thin films with tilted and in-plane magnetic anisotropy:  first-principles study</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ultrathin L1$_0$ films with different $c$-axis orientations relative to the
film plane are promising candidates for data storage materials. In this work,
within the framework of density functional theory, we calculated the magnetic
properties of ultrathin L1$_0$ (111) and (010) films with thicknesses ranging
from 4 to 16 atomic monolayers (from about 0.8 to 3.5~nm). The highest average
magnetic moments are observed for the thinnest films considered, and with
increasing film thickness, the values converge towards the magnetic moment for
bulk. The observed increase comes mainly from enhanced moments in the two
atomic monolayers closest to the surface of the films. The easy axis of
magnetization of (111) films prefers an alignment close to the tetragonal axis,
an example of tilted magnetic anisotropy. The 6-monolayer (111) film (about
1.3~nm thick) inclines the easy axis of magnetization of about 45{\deg} to the
film plane, which can find use in applications. The (010) films show an
in-plane easy magnetization axis in a unique L1$_0$ tetragonal direction. This
is an unusual type of in-plane anisotropy, as the particular direction
preference is very strong. The computational results encourage further
experimental studies of L1$_0$ systems with tilted and in-plane fixed magnetic
anisotropy.

Strain engineering is an efficient tool to tune and tailor the electrical and
optical properties of 2D materials. The built-in strain can be tuned during the
synthesis process of a two dimensional semiconductor, as molybdenum disulfide,
by employing different growth substrate with peculiar thermal properties. In
this work we demonstrate that the built-in strain of MoS2 monolayers, grown on
SiO2/Si substrate using liquid precursors chemical vapor deposition, is mainly
dominated by the size of the monolayer. In fact, we identify a critical size
equal to 20 um, from which the built-in strain increases drastically. The
built-in strain is maximized for 60 um sized monolayer, leading to 1.2% tensile
strain with a partial release of strain close to the monolayer triangular
vertexes due to formation of nanocracks. These findings also imply that the
standard method for evaluation of the number of layers based on the Raman modes
separation becomes unreliable for monolayer with a lateral size above 20 um.

<br>
<br>
The competition between intrinsic disorder in superconducting
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) thin films and an ultradense triangular
lattice of cylindrical pinning centers spaced at 30 nm intervals results in an
ordered Bose glass phase of vortices. The samples were created by scanning the
focused beam of a helium-ion microscope over the surface of the YBCO thin film
to form columns of point defects where superconductivity was locally
suppressed. The voltage-current isotherms reveal critical behavior and scale in
the vicinity of the second-order glass transition. The latter exhibits a
distinct peak in melting temperature ($T_g$) vs. applied magnetic field ($B_a$)
at the magnetic commensurability field, along with a sharp rise in the
lifetimes of glassy fluctuations. Angle-dependent magnetoresistance
measurements in constant-Lorentz-force geometry unveil a strong increase in
anisotropy compared to a pristine reference film where the density of vortices
matches that of the columnar defects. The pinning is therefore, dominated by
the magnetic-field component parallel to the columnar defects, exposing its
one-dimensional character. These results support the idea of an ordered Bose
glass phase.

Planar superconducting microwave transmission line resonators can be operated
at multiple harmonic resonance frequencies. This allows covering wide spectral
regimes with high sensitivity, as it is desired e.g. for cryogenic microwave
spectroscopy. A common complication of such experiments is the presence of
undesired 'spurious' additional resonances, which are due to standing waves
within the resonator substrate or housing box. Identifying the nature of
individual resonances ('designed' vs. 'spurious') can become challenging for
higher frequencies or if elements with unknown material properties are
included, as is common for microwave spectroscopy. Here we discuss various
experimental strategies to distinguish designed and spurious modes in coplanar
superconducting resonators that are operated in a broad frequency range up to
20 GHz. These strategies include tracking resonance evolution as a function of
temperature, magnetic field, and microwave power. We also demonstrate that
local modification of the resonator, by applying minute amounts of dielectric
or ESR-active materials, lead to characteristic signatures in the various
resonance modes, depending on the local strength of the electric or magnetic
microwave fields.

<br>
<br>
A number of dense particle suspensions experience a dramatic increase in
viscosity with the shear stress, up to a solid-like response. This
shear-thickening process is understood as a frictionless/frictional transition
between particles that repel each other. Here, we show that the emblematic
shear-thickening fluid, cornstarch, does not fit into this framework. Using an
original pressure sensor array, we map the normal stresses in the flow. We
evidence in cornstarch a unique, stable stress wave which does not appear in a
purely repulsive system (calcium carbonate). At high solid fraction and small
gap, the stress signal shows a rolling aggregate, which presence is explained
by adhesive contacts (associated with a hysteresis in the force profile)
between two particles. Our findings offer a new perspective on the
shear-thickening process of cornstarch, which is deeply connected to adhesion.
As a result, experiments on cornstarch may not be generalized to other
shear-thickening fluids.

Magnetic interfaces and the phenomena arising from them drive both the design
of modern spintronics and fundamental research. Recently, it was revealed that
through designing magnetic frustration in configurationally complex entropy
stabilized oxides, exchange bias can occur in structurally single crystal
films. This eliminates the need for complex heterostructures and nanocomposites
in the design and control of magnetic response phenomena. In this work, we
demonstrate through hole doping of a high entropy perovskite oxide that tuning
of magnetic responses can be achieved. With detailed magnetometry, we show
magnetic coupling exhibiting a variety of magnetic responses including exchange
bias and antiferromagnetic spin reversal in the entropy stabilized ABO3
perovskite oxide La1-xSrx(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 family. We find that
manipulation of the A-site charge state can be used to balance magnetic phase
compositions and coupling responses. This allows for the creation of highly
tunable exchange bias responses. In the low Sr doping regime, a spin frustrated
region arising at the antiferromagnetic phase boundary is shown to directly
couple to the antiferromagnetic moments of the film and emerges as the dominant
mechanism, leading to a vertical shift of magnetization loops in response to
field biasing. At higher concentrations, direct coupling of antiferromagnetic
and ferromagnetic regions is observed. This tunability of magnetic coupling is
discussed within the context of these three competing magnetic phases,
revealing critical features in designing exchange bias through exploiting spin
frustration and disorder in high entropy oxides.

<h3>Full counting statistics of ultrafast quantum transport</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum transport in the presence of time-dependent drives is dominated by
quantum interference and many-body effects at low temperatures. For a periodic
driving, the analysis of the full counting statistics revealed the elementary
events that determine the statistical properties of the charge transport. As a
result, the noise correlations display quantum oscillation as functions of the
ratio of the voltage amplitude and the drive frequency reflecting the detailed
shape of the drive. However, so far only continuous wave excitations were
considered, but recently transport by few-cycle light pulses were investigated
and the need for a statistical interpretation became eminent. We address the
charge transfer generated by single- or few-cycle light pulses. The
fingerprints of these time-dependent voltage pulses are imprinted in the full
counting statistics of a coherent mesoscopic conductor at zero temperature. In
addition, we identify the elementary processes that occur in the form of
electron-hole pair creations, which can be investigated by the excess noise. We
study the quantum oscillations in the differential noise induced by a wave
packet consisting of an oscillating carrier modulated by a Gaussian- or a
box-shaped envelope. As expected, the differential noise exhibits an
oscillatory behavior with increasing amplitude. In particular, we find clear
signature of the so-called carrier-envelope phase in the peak heights and
positions of these quantum oscillations. More carrier cycles under the Gaussian
envelope diminish the influence of the carrier-envelope phase, while this is
not true for the box pulses, probably related to the abrupt onset. As the
quantum oscillations are due to the energy-time uncertainty of the short
pulses, our results pave the way to a description of the nonequilibrium
electron transport in terms of a many-body Wigner function of the electronic
system.

<h3>MoS2/MoO3 Heterojunction: Dual Role of the Type II set-up and Band Gap  Modulation of MoS2 upon Lithium-Ion Intercalation</h3>

In recent times photorechargeable metal ion batteries have garnered
significant attention but the atomistic details of the mechanism of the
charging process is still unknown. MoS2/MoOy, a type II semiconductor
heterostructure, has been shown to function as photocathode where during
discharge the lithium ion (Li-ion) intercalation happens mostly in MoS2 layers.
Photoexposure leads to exciton formation and the type II set-up is supposed to
generate spatially separated and longer-lived charge carriers. The Li
intercalated MoS2 is known to undergo a phase transition from the
semiconducting (2H) to a metallic (1T') phase. Hence, the proposal of exciton
formation and its separation in LixMoS2 during photocharging needs closer
inspection. In this study, with the help of density functional theory (DFT)
based studies that is aptly supported by experimental data, it is shown that
LixMoS2/MoO3 forms a type II heterostructure where the underlying band gap of
LixMoS2 is exposed due to dispersion of electron density onto MoO3 upto a
certain value of x. Further studies show that the type II arrangement is lost
prior to the phase transition. In order to investigate the electronic structure
and the phase transition upon lithiation in the explicit heterostructure, we
introduced two unconventional computational schemes. The presence of the band
gap and the ensuing type II arrangement in LixMoS2/MoO3 upto a certain
concentration of the intercalated Li-ion justifies the possibility of the
photocharging process. We believe that the general concepts explored in this
study will be important in the rational design of type II heterostructures that
can behave as photo-cathode materials in Li-ion batteries.

We investigate the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in the
multi-band Bloch Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional periodic Kitaev model after
a quench from a Bloch band. Our study goes beyond the limitations of previous
works that primarily focused on two-band models and reveals significant
differences in DQPT between the two-band and multi-band systems. Our results
show that only the quench from the Bloch states, which causes the band gap to
collapse at the critical point, induces the DQPT after crossing the quantum
phase transition; otherwise, the DQPT will not occur. Additionally, the
critical times of the DQPT are not evenly spaced due to the deviation in the
critical momentum caused by the non-analytic singularities of the Pancharatnam
geometric phase. Our findings provide a better understanding of the
characteristics of non-equilibrium systems surrounding DQPTs.

<br>
<br>
It is well known that point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy provides
reliable measurements of the energy gap(s) in a superconductor when the contact
is in the ballistic or nearly-ballistic regime. However, especially when the
mean free path of the material under study is small, obtaining ballistic
contacts can be a major challenge. One of the signatures of a Maxwell
contribution to the contact resistance is the presence of "dips" in the
differential conductance, associated to the sudden appearance of a Maxwell
term, in turn due to the attainment of the critical current of the material in
the contact region. Here we show that, using a proper model for the $R(I)$ of
the material under study, it is possible to fit the experimental curves
(without the need of normalization) obtaining the correct values of the gap
amplitudes even in the presence of such dips, as well as the temperature
dependence of the critical current in the contact. We present a test of the
procedure in the case of Andreev-reflection spectra in
Mg$_{0.75}$Al$_{0.25}$B$_2$ single crystals.

Ultraviolet nanosecond laser annealing (LA) is a powerful tool where strongly
confined heating and melting are desirable. In semiconductor technologies the
importance of LA increases with the increasing complexity of the proposed
integration schemes. Optimizing the LA process along with the experimental
design is challenging, especially when complex 3D nanostructured systems with
various shapes and phases are involved. Within this context, reliable
simulations of laser melting are required for optimizing the process parameters
while reducing the number of experimental tests. This gives rise to a virtual
Design of Experiments (DoE). SiGe alloys are nowadays used for their
compatibility with silicon devices enabling to engineer properties such as
strain, carrier mobilities and bandgap. In this work, the laser melting process
of relaxed and strained SiGe is simulated with a finite element method / phase
field approach. Particularly, we calibrated the dielectric functions of the
alloy for its crystal and liquid phase using experimental data. We highlighted
the importance of reproducing the exact reflectivity of the material in its
different aggregation states, to correctly mimic the process.

By using the five Angstrom diameter pores of calcined zeolite as the
template, we have fabricated boron doped carbon nanotube networks via the
chemical vapor deposition method. Raman data indicate the network to comprise
segments of interconnected carbon nano tubes. Transport measurements showed a
superconducting transition initiating at 40K, with a sharp downturn around 20K
to a low resistance state at 2K, accompanied by a low resistance plateau in the
current voltage characteristic, fluctuating around zero resistance. Magnetic
measurements exhibited the Meissner effect characteristic of thin
superconducting wire networks in which the superconducting wire radius is much
smaller than the London penetration length. At low magnetic field, the negative
diamagnetic susceptibility was observed to persist beyond 200K. The transport
and magnetic data are reconciled on the basis of a physical model based on weak
links comprising short, one-dimensional superconducting nano tubes, that govern
the global transport behavior.

Using spin currents generated by fs laser pulses, we demonstrate excitation
of GHz ferromagnetic resonance and THz ferrimagnetic exchange resonances in
Co/Gd/Co/Gd multilayers by time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect
measurements. Varying the Gd layer thickness allows for a tuning of the
resonance spectrum by manipulating the total angular momentum and strength of
effective exchange fields between the antiferromagnetically coupled layers.
Close to the compensation point of angular momentum, a minimum in the frequency
of the exchange-dominated mode and a maximum in the frequency of the
ferromagnetic resonance mode is observed. Finally, to gain better understanding
of the excitation mechanism, we analyze the anomalous variation in the measured
exchange mode amplitude as a function of its frequency. A peak in this
amplitude in the vicinity of the compensation point of angular momentum is
explained using a macrospin model, taking nonlinear effects at finite
precession amplitudes into account.

Crystals spontaneously break the continuous translation symmetry in space,
despite the invariance of the underlying energy function. This has triggered
suggestions of time crystals analogously lifting translational invariance in
time. Originally suggested for closed thermodynamic systems in equilibrium,
no-go theorems prevent the existence of time crystals. Proposals for open
systems out of equilibrium led to the observation of discrete time crystals
subject to external periodic driving to which they respond with a sub-harmonic
response. A continuous time crystal is an autonomous system that develops
periodic auto-oscillations when exposed to a continuous, time-independent
driving, as recently demonstrated for the density in an atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate with a crystal lifetime of a few ms. Here we demonstrate an
ultra-robust continuous time crystal in the nonlinear electron-nuclear spin
system of a tailored semiconductor with a coherence time exceeding hours.
Varying the experimental parameters reveals huge stability ranges of this time
crystal, but allows one also to enter chaotic regimes, where aperiodic behavior
appears corresponding to melting of the crystal. This novel phase of matter
opens the possibility to study systems with nonlinear interactions in an
unprecedented way.

<h3>Chiral-Flux-Phase-Based Topological Superconductivity in Kagome Systems  with Mixed Edge Charilities</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent studies have attracted intense attention on the quasi-2D kagome
superconductors $ A\text{V}_3\text{Sb}_5 $ ($ A = $ K, Rb, and Cs) where the
unexpected chiral flux phase (CFP) associates with the spontaneous
time-reversal symmetry breaking in charge density wave (CDW) states. Here,
commencing from the 2-by-2 CDW phases, we bridge the gap between topological
superconductivity (TSC) and time-reversal asymmetric CFP in kagome systems.
Several chiral TSC states featuring distinct Chern numbers emerge for an s-wave
or a d-wave superconducting pairing symmetry. Importantly, these CFP-based TSC
phases possess unique gapless edge modes with mixed chiralities (i.e., both
positive and negative chiralities), but with the net chiralities consistent
with the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We further study the transport
properties of a two-terminal junction, using Chern insulator or normal metal
leads via atomic Green's function method with Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. In
both cases, the normal electron tunneling and the crossed Andreev reflection
oscillate as the chemical potential changes, but together contribute to plateau
transmissions (1 and 3/2, respectively). These behaviors can be regarded as the
signature of a topological superconductor hosting edge states with mixed
chiralities.

We investigate the infinite temperature dynamics of the complex
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK$_4$) complimented with a single particle hopping
term (SYK$_2$), leading to the chaos-to-integrable crossover of the many-body
eigenstates. Due to the presence of the all-to-all connected SYK$_2$ term, a
non-equilibrium prethermal state emerges for a finite time window
$t_{th}\propto 2^{a/\sqrt{\lambda}}$ that scales with the relative interaction
strength $\lambda$, between the SYK terms before eventually exhibiting
thermalization for all $\lambda$. The scaling of the plateau with $\lambda$ is
consistent with the many-body Fock space structure of the time-evolved wave
function. In the integrable limit, the wavefunction in the Fock space has a
stretched exponential dependence on distance. On the contrary, in the SYK$_4$
limit, it is distributed equally over the Fock space points characterizing the
ergodic phase at long times.

Twisted van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a unique platform for
engineering the efficient Josephson coupling between cuprate thin crystals
harboring the nodal superconducting order parameter. Preparing vdW
heterostructures-based Josephson junction comprising stacked cuprates requires
maintaining an ordered interface with preserved surface superconductivity.
Here, we report the preparation of the Josephson junction out of the stacked
Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+d crystals using the cryogenic dry transfer technique and
encapsulating the junction with an insulating layer, that protects the
interface during the electrical contacts evaporation at the 10-6 mbar base
pressure. We find that the Josephson critical current Ic has a maximum at low
twist angles, comparable to that of the bulk intrinsic Josephson junctions, and
is reduced by two orders of magnitude at twist angles close to 45{\deg}. The
reduction of Ic occurs due to a mismatch between superconducting d-wave order
parameters, which suppresses the direct Cooper pair tunneling.

Phase-shifting electron holography is an excellent method to reveal electron
wave phase information with very high phase sensitivity over a large range of
spatial frequencies. It circumvents the limiting trade-off between fringe
spacing and visibility of standard off-axis holography. Previous
implementations have been limited by the independent drift of biprism and
sample. We demonstrate here an advanced drift correction scheme for the
hologram series that allow to obtain reliable phase information at the 1 {\AA}
information limit of the used Titan 80-300 kV environmental transmission
electron microscope using a single biprism at moderate voltage of 250 V. The
obtained phase and amplitude information is validated at a thin Pt sample by
use of multislice image simulation with the frozen lattice approximation and
shows excellent agreement. The presented method drastically reduces the
hardware requirements and thus allows to achieve high resolution in off-axis
holography in various instruments including those for in-situ applications. A
software implementation for the acquisition, calibration and reconstruction is
provided.

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations allowing to describe photons propagation in
statistical mixtures represent an interest that goes way beyond the domain of
optics, and can cover, e.g., nuclear reactor physics, image analysis or life
science just to name a few. MC simulations are considered a ``gold standard''
because they give exact solutions (in the statistical sense), however, in the
case of statistical mixtures they are enormously time consuming and their
implementation is often extremely complex. For this reason, the aim of the
present contribution is to propose a new approach that should allow us in the
future to simplify the MC approach. This is done through an explanatory
example, i.e.; by deriving the `exact' analytical expression for the
probability density function of photons' random steps (single step function,
SSF) propagating in a medium represented as a binary (isotropic-Poisson)
statistical mixture. The use of the SSF reduces the problem to an `equivalent'
homogeneous medium behaving exactly as the original binary statistical mixture.
This will reduce hundreds time-consuming MC simulations to only one equivalent
simple MC simulation. To the best of our knowledge the analytically `exact' SSF
for a binary (isotropic-Poisson) statistical mixture has never been derived
before.

It is often desirable to know the controlling mechanism of survival
probability of nano - or microscale particles in small cavities such as, e.g.,
confined submicron particles in fiber beds of high-efficiency filter media or
ions/small molecules in confined cellular structures. Here we address this
issue based on numerical study of the escape kinetics of inertial Brownian
colloidal particles from various types of cavities with single and multiple
pores. We consider both the situations of strong and weak viscous damping. Our
simulation results show that as long as the thermal length is larger than the
cavity size the mean exit time remains insensitive to the medium viscous
damping. On further increasing damping strength, a linear relation between
escape rate and damping strength emerges gradually. This result is in sharp
contrast to the energy barrier crossing dynamics where the escape rate exhibits
a turnover behavior as a function of the damping strength. Moreover, in the
ballistic regime, the exit rate is directly proportional to the pore width and
the thermal velocity. All these attributes are insensitive to the cavity as
well as the pore structures. Further, we show that the effects of pore
structure variation on the escape kinetics are conspicuously different in the
low damping regimes compared to the overdamped situation. Apart from direct
applications in biology and nanotechnology, our simulation results can
potentially be used to understand diffusion of living or artificial micro/nano
objects, such as bacteria, virus, Janus Particle etc. where memory effects play
dictating roles.

We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the motility of
a 2D vesicle containing self-propelled rods, as a function of the vesicle
bending rigidity and the number density, length, and activity of the enclosed
rods. Above a threshold value of the rod length, distinct dynamical regimes
emerge, including a dramatic enhancement of vesicle motility characterized by a
highly persistent random walk. These regimes are determined by clustering of
the rods within the vesicle; the maximum motility state arises when there is
one long-lived polar cluster. We develop a scaling theory that predicts the
dynamical regimes as a function of control parameters, and shows that feedback
between activity and passive membrane forces govern the rod organization. These
findings yield design principles for building self-propelled superstructures
using independent active agents under deformable confinement.

Organic semiconductors are a promising class of materials for numerous
electronic and optoelectronic applications, including solar cells. However,
these materials tend to be extremely sensitive to the local environment and
surrounding molecular geometry, causing the energy levels near boundaries and
interfaces essential to device function to differ from those of the bulk.
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STM/STS) has the ability to
examine both the structural and electronic properties of these interfaces on
the molecular and submolecular scale. Here we investigate the prototypical
acceptor/donor system PTCDA/CuPc using sub-molecularly resolved pixel-by-pixel
STS to demonstrate the importance of subtle changes in interface geometry in
prototypical solar cell materials. PTCDA and CuPc were sequentially deposited
on NaCl bilayers to create lateral heterojunctions that were decoupled from the
underlying substrate. Donor and acceptor states were observed to shift in
opposite directions suggesting an equilibrium charge transfer between the two.
Narrowing of the gap energy compared to isolated molecules on the same surface
are indicative of the influence of the local dielectric environment. Further,
we find that the electronic state energies of both acceptor and donor are
strongly dependent on the ratio and positioning of both molecules in larger
clusters. This molecular-scale structural dependence of the electronic states
of both interfacial acceptor and donor has significant implications for device
design where level alignment strongly correlates to device performance.

Time-resolved ultrafast EUV magnetic scattering was used to test a recent
prediction of >10 km/s domain wall speeds by optically exciting a magnetic
sample with a nanoscale labyrinthine domain pattern. Ultrafast distortion of
the diffraction pattern was observed at markedly different timescales compared
to the magnetization quenching. The diffraction pattern distortion shows a
threshold-dependence with laser fluence, not seen for magnetization quenching,
consistent with a picture of domain wall motion with pinning sites. Supported
by simulations, we show that a speed of $\approx$ 66 km/s for highly curved
domain walls can explain the experimental data. While our data agree with the
prediction of extreme, non-equilibrium wall speeds locally, it differs from the
details of the theory, suggesting that additional mechanisms are required to
fully understand these effects.

The electronic properties of metal-molecule interfaces can in principle be
controlled by molecular design and self-assembly, yielding great potential for
future nano- and optoelectronic technologies. However, the coupling between
molecular orbitals and the electronic states of the surface can significantly
influence molecular states. In particular, molecules designed to create
metal-organic self-assembled networks have functional groups that by necessity
are designed to interact strongly with metals. Here, we investigate the
adsorption interactions of a terpyridine (tpy)-based molecule on a noble metal,
Ag(111), by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy (STS) together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
By comparing the local density of states (DOS) information gained from STS for
the molecule on the bare Ag(111) surface with that of the molecule decoupled
from the underlying metal by a NaCl bilayer, we find that tpy-localized
orbitals hybridize strongly with the metal substrate. Meanwhile, those related
to the phenyl rings that link the two terminal tpy groups are less influenced
by the interaction with the surface. The selective hybridization of the tpy
groups provides an example of strong, orbital-specific electronic coupling
between a functional group and a noble-metal surface, which may alter the
intended balance of interactions and resulting electronic behavior of the
molecule-metal interface.

<h3>Plasma Instability and Amplified Mode Switching Effect in THz Field  Effect Transistors with Grating Gate</h3>

We developed a theory of collective plasma oscillations in a dc
current-biased field effect transistor with interdigitated dual grating gate
and demonstrated a new mechanism of electron plasma instability in this
structure. The instability in the plasmonic crystal formed in the transistor
channel develops due to conversion of the kinetic energy carried by the
drifting plasmons into electromagnetic energy. The conversion happens at the
opposite sides of the gate fingers due to the asymmetry produced by the current
flow and occurs through the gate finger fringing capacitances. The key feature
of the proposed instability mechanism is the behavior of the plasma frequency
peak and its width as functions of the dc current bias. At a certain critical
value of the current, the plasma resonant peak with small instability increment
experiencing redshift with increasing current changes to the blue shifting peak
with large instability increment. This amplified mode switching (AMS) effect
has been recently observed in graphene-interdigitated structures (S.
Boubanga-Tombet et al., Phys. Rev. X 10, 031004 (2020)). The obtained
theoretical results are in very good qualitative agreement with these
experiments and can be used in future designs of the compact sources of THz EM
radiation.

Moir\'e heterobilayers host interlayer excitons in a natural, periodic array
of trapping potentials. Recent work has elucidated the structure of the trapped
interlayer excitons and the nature of photoluminescence (PL) from trapped and
itinerant charged complexes such as interlayer trions in these structures. In
this paper, our results serve to add to the understanding of the nature of PL
emission and explain its characteristic blueshift with increasing carrier
density, along with demonstrating a significant difference between the
interlayer exciton-trion conversion efficiency as compared to both localized
and itinerant intra-layer species in conventional monolayers. Our results show
the absence of optical generation of trions in these materials, which we
suggest arises from the highly localized, near sub-nm confinement of trapped
species in these Moir\'e potentials.

Using an efficient polynomial-time ground state algorithm we investigate the
Ising spin glass state at zero temperature in two dimensions. For large sizes,
we show that the spin state in a central region is independent of the
interactions far away, indicating a ``single-state" picture, presumably the
droplet model. Surprisingly, a single power law describes corrections to this
result down to the smallest sizes studied.
