<h3>A single-particle energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics  approach for simulating thermophoresis of nanoparticles in polymer networks</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18834" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18834</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yu Lu, Guo-Hui Hu</i>
<p>Thermophoresis is an effective method to drive the motion of nanoparticles in
fluids. The transport of nanoparticles in polymer networks has significant
fundamental and applied importance in biology and medicine, and can be
described as Brownian particles crossing entropic barriers. This study proposes
a novel extension of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), called the
single-particle energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics (seDPD), which
combines the features of single-particle dissipative particle dynamics (sDPD)
and energy-conserving dissipative particle dynamics (eDPD) to simulate the
thermophoresis of nanoparticles under temperature gradients. The reliability of
the seDPD method is verified by considering the viscosity, thermal diffusivity,
and hydrodynamic drag force on the nanoparticles. Using this method, the
transport of nanoparticles driven by the thermophoretic force across the
polymer network is simulated. The results show that the nanoparticles exhibit
the phenomenon of giant acceleration of diffusion (GAD) in the polymer network,
indicating that Brownian particles can exhibit GAD when crossing entropic
barriers.

<p>We study viscoelastic response in Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal
symmetry. Topology and anisotropy of the Fermi surface are manifested in the
viscoelasticity tensor of the electron fluid. In the dynamic (inter-band) part
of this tensor, the anisotropy leads to a qualitatively different, compared to
isotropic models, scaling with frequency and the Fermi energy. While components
of the viscosity tensor determined by the Fermi surface properties agree in the
Kubo and kinetic formalisms, the latter misses the anomalous Hall viscosity
determined by filled states below the Fermi surface. The anisotropy of the
dispersion relation is also manifested in the acceleration and relaxation terms
of the hydrodynamic equations.

<h3>Emergence of Weyl Points due to Spin Orbit Coupling in LK-99</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18588" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18588</a>
<br>
</p><i>Bishnu Karki, Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</i>
<p>Recent reports of room temperature ambient pressure superconductivity in
LK-99 sparked tremendous excitement. While the materials is no longer believed
to be superconducting, interest in its electronic and topological properties
still stands. Here, we utilize first-principle density functional theory and
augment a recently proposed model tight-binding Hamiltonian to study the band
topology including the impact of spin-orbit coupling. In the absence of
spin-orbit coupling, we observed the presence of two isolated bands situated
near the Fermi level. However, upon the introduction of spin-orbit coupling,
these two bands split into four bands and generate multiple Weyl points with
Chern number $\pm 2$. We also find accidental crossings along high symmetry
lines which, at the level of our minimal Hamiltonian, extend as nodal surfaces
away from these lines.

<h3>Unifying Finite-Temperature Dynamical and Excited-State Quantum Phase  Transitions</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18622" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18622</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ángel L. Corps, Armando Relaño, Jad C. Halimeh</i>
<p>In recent years, various notions of dynamical phase transitions have emerged
to describe far-from-equilibrium criticality. A unifying framework connecting
these different concepts is still missing, and would provide significant
progress towards understanding far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body
universality. Initializing our system in a thermal ensemble and subsequently
performing quantum quenches in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we establish a
direct connection between excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) and
two major types of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), by relating the phases
of the latter to the critical energies and conservation laws in the former. Our
work provides further insight into how various concepts of non-ground-state
criticality are intimately connected, paving the way for a unified framework of
far-from-equilibrium universality.

<h3>Strange metal in the doped Hubbard model via percolation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18626" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18626</a>
<br>
</p><i>Andrew A. Allocca</i>
<p>Many strongly correlated systems, including high-temperature superconductors
such as the cuprates, exhibit strange metallic behavior in certain parameter
regimes characterized by anomalous transport properties that are irreconcilable
with a Fermi-liquid-like description in terms of quasiparticles. The Hubbard
model is a standard theoretical starting point to examine the properties of
such systems and also exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior in simulations. Here
we analytically study the two-dimensional hole-doped Hubbard model, first
identifying a percolation transition that occurs in the low-energy sector at
critical hole doping $p_c\sim 0.19$. We then use the critical properties near
this transition to rewrite the Hubbard Hamiltonian in a way that motivates a
large-$N$ model with strange metallic properties. In particular, we show that
this model has the linear-in-$T$ resistivity and power-law optical conductivity
$\sim |\omega|^{-2/3}$ observed in the strange metal regime of cuprates,
suggesting potential relevance for describing this important class of
materials.

<h3>Topologically protected emergent Fermi surface in an Abrikosov vortex  lattice</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18627" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18627</a>
<br>
</p><i>Songyang Pu, Jay D. Sau, Rui-Xing Zhang</i>
<p>We show that a three-dimensional (3D) fully gapped type-II superconductor can
feature emergent in-gap Fermi surfaces of Caroli-de Gennes Matricon (CdGM)
quasiparticles in the presence of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. In particular,
these CdGM Fermi surfaces manifest in the emergent 3D band structure enabled by
the intervortex tunneling physics, and their stability is guaranteed by a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index. By developing an effective analytical theory,
we find that each vortex line carrying a 1D nodal dispersion is a sufficient
condition for the vortex lattice to form CdGM Fermi surfaces. Following this
prediction, in-gap CdGM Fermi surfaces are numerically confirmed in a
microscopic vortex-lattice simulation of a superconducting Dirac semimetal with
an $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing, which is directly applicable to a large class
of type-II superconductors such as LiFeAs. Remarkably, the CdGM Fermi surfaces
persist even when the normal state is deformed to a doped insulator of trivial
band topology. Our work establishes the vortex lattice as a new experimentally
feasible control knob for emergent topological phenomena in conventional
superconductors.

<h3>SU(3) altermagnetism: Lattice models, chiral magnons, and flavor-split  bands</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18629" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18629</a>
<br>
</p><i>Pedro M. Cônsoli, Matthias Vojta</i>
<p>Altermagnetism, a type of magnetic order that combines properties of
ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, has generated significant interest recently,
in particular due to its potential spintronics applications. Here, we show that
altermagnetic states, which typically involve collinear magnetic order of SU(2)
spins, can be generalized to higher SU($N$) symmetry groups. We construct a
two-dimensional Heisenberg model for a three-sublattice SU(3) altermagnet and
analyze its excitation spectrum via flavor-wave theory. By deriving a general
formula for the chirality of the excitations, we show that the SU(3)
altermagnet harbors chiral magnons that are split in energy. We also compute
the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and
map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands. We conclude by
discussing further generalizations.

<h3>Breakdown of the static dielectric screening approximation of Coulomb  interactions in atomically thin semiconductors</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18639</a>

<p>Coulomb interactions in atomically thin materials are uniquely sensitive to
variations in the dielectric screening of the environment, which can be used to
control quasiparticles and exotic quantum many-body phases. A static
approximation of the dielectric response, where increased dielectric screening
is predicted to cause an energy redshift of the exciton resonance, has been
until now sufficient. Here, we use charge-tunable exciton resonances to study
screening effects in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers embedded in
materials with dielectric constants ranging from 4 to more than 1000. In
contrast to expectations, we observe a blueshift of the exciton resonance
exceeding 30 meV for larger dielectric constant environments. By employing a
dynamical screening model, we find that while the exciton binding energy
remains mostly controlled by the static dielectric response, the exciton
self-energy is dominated by the high-frequency response. Dielectrics with
markedly different static and high-frequency screening enable the selective
addressing of distinct many-body effects in layered materials and their
heterostructures, expanding the tunability range and offering new routes to
detect and control correlated quantum many-body states and to design
optoelectronic and quantum devices.

<h3>Slow crossover from superdiffusion to diffusion in isotropic spin chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18661" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18661</a>
<br>
</p><i>Catherine McCarthy, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Romain Vasseur</i>
<p>Finite-temperature spin transport in integrable isotropic spin chains (i.e.,
spin chains with continuous nonabelian symmetries) is known to be
superdiffusive, with anomalous transport properties displaying remarkable
robustness to isotropic integrability-breaking perturbations. Using a
discrete-time classical model, we numerically study the crossover to
conventional diffusion resulting from both noisy and Floquet isotropic
perturbations of strength $\lambda$. We identify an anomalously-long crossover
time scale $t_\star \sim \lambda^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 6$ in both
cases. We discuss our results in terms of a kinetic theory of transport that
characterizes the lifetimes of large solitons responsible for superdiffusion.

<h3>Parametrically long lifetime of superdiffusion in non-integrable spin  chains</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18662" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18662</a>
<br>
</p><i>Adam J. McRoberts, Roderich Moessner</i>
<p>Superdiffusion is surprisingly easily observed even in systems without the
integrability underpinning this phenomenon. Indeed, the classical Heisenberg
chain -- one of the simplest many-body systems, and firmly believed to be
non-integrable -- evinces a long-lived regime of anomalous, superdiffusive spin
dynamics at finite temperature. Similarly, superdiffusion persists for long
timescales, even at high temperature, for small perturbations around a related
integrable model. Eventually, however, ordinary diffusion is believed to be
asymptotically restored. We examine the timescales governing the lifetime of
the superdiffusive regime, and argue that it diverges algebraically fast --
both in deviation from the integrable limit, and at low temperature, where we
find $t^* \sim T^{-\zeta}$ with an exponent possibly as large as $\zeta = 8$.
This can render the crossover to ordinary diffusion practically inaccessible.

<h3>Coherent control of terahertz-scale spin resonances using optical  spin-orbit torques</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Julian Hintermayr, Paul M. P. van Kuppevelt, Bert Koopmans</i>
<p>Using optically generated spin-orbit torques generated by the heavy metal Pt
we demonstrate coherent control of GHz ferromagnetic resonances in Pt/Co/Pt
multilayers as well as sub-THz exchange resonances in [Gd/Co]$_2$ multilayers.
Employing a double-pump setup, we show that depending on the helicities of the
pump pulses, spin resonances can either be coherently amplified or suppressed
if the time delay between the arrival of the pump beams is chosen
appropriately. Furthermore, investigating phase and amplitude of the
exchange-driven modes, we identify features that challenge the current
understanding of optically generated spin-orbit torques, and we discuss
possible explanations.

<h3>Universal Scaling of Clustering Instability for Interacting Active  Brownian Particles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18711" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18711</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rüdiger Kürsten</i>
<p>We study the overdamped motion of interacting active Brownian particles in
two dimensions. An instability in the pair correlation function causes the
onset of clustering. This clustering mechanism depends mainly on the
self-propulsion properties of the active particles and details of the
interactions do not effect the scaling of the clustering instability.
Theoretical predictions from repeated ring-kinetic theory are compared to
agent-based simulations.

<h3>Symmetry-breaking normal state response and surface superconductivity in  topological semimetal YPtBi</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18735" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18735</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hyunsoo Kim, Tristin Metz, Halyna Hodovanets, Daniel Kraft, Kefeng Wang, Yun Suk Eo, Johnpierre Paglione</i>
<p>Most of the half-Heusler RPtBi compounds (R=rare earth) host various surface
states due to spin-orbit coupling driven topological band structure. While
recent ARPES measurements ubiquitously reported the existence of surface states
in RPtBi, their evidence by other experimental techniques remains elusive. Here
we report the angle-dependent magnetic field response of electrical transport
properties of YPtBi in both the normal and superconducting states. The angle
dependence of both magnetoresistance and the superconducting upper critical
field breaks the rotational symmetry of the cubic crystal structure, and the
angle between the applied magnetic field and the measurement plane of a
plate-like sample prevails. Furthermore, the measured upper critical field is
notably higher than the bulk response for an in-plane magnetic field
configuration, suggesting the presence of quasi-2D superconductivity. Our work
suggests the transport properties cannot be explained solely by the bulk
carrier response, requiring robust normal and superconducting surface states to
flourish in YPtBi.

<h3>Simple Calibration of Block Copolymer Melt Models</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18760" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18760</a>
<br>
</p><i>Artem Petrov, Hejin Huang, Alfredo Alexander-Katz</i>
<p>According to the universality hypothesis, the phase behavior of different
block copolymer melt models having fixed composition depends solely on two
parameters: the invariant chain length $\bar{N}$ and the effective interaction
parameter $\chi N$. If models behave universally, they can be compared to each
other and can predict experiment quantitatively. Here, we present a simple way
to achieve this universality for coarse-grained models. Our method relies on
the properties of the monomer interaction potential energy $z$ distribution. In
particular, models having near-symmetric $z$-distributions exhibit universal
phase behavior using the standard linear definition of the Flory-Huggins
parameter $\chi\propto\alpha$, where $\alpha =
\epsilon_{AB}-(\epsilon_{AA}+\epsilon_{BB})/2$, and $\epsilon_{xy}$ is the
interaction energy between monomers of type $x$ and $y$. Previously,
universality had been achieved using a nonlinear $\chi(\alpha)$ function which
is difficult to obtain and interpret physically. The main parameter controlling
the symmetry of the $z$-distribution is the monomer density $\rho$. Above
certain $\rho$, models have symmetric $z$-distributions, and their
order-disorder transition points follow the universal curve predicted by
Fredrickson-Helfand theory in the experimentally relevant $\bar{N} > 10^2$
range. On the other hand, low-$\rho$ models exhibit skewed $z$-distributions,
and the simple $\chi\propto\alpha$ formula is no longer universally applicable
to them. Our results can be used for correct block copolymer model building
leading to a simple and direct comparison of simulations to experiments, which
will facilitate the screening of new block copolymer morphologies and support
materials design.

<h3>Discovery of magnetic phase transitions in heavy-fermion superconductor  CeRh$_2$As$_2$</h3>

</p><i>Grzegorz Chajewski, Dariusz Kaczorowski</i>
<p>We report on the specific heat studies performed on a new generation of
CeRh$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. Superior quality of the samples and dedicated
experimental protocol allowed us to observe an antiferromagnetic-like behavior
in the normal state and to detect the first-order phase transition of magnetic
origin within the superconducting state of the compound. Although in the
available literature the physical behavior of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is most often
described with the use of quadrupole density wave scenario, we propose an
alternative explanation using analogies to antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion
superconductors CeRhIn$_5$ and Ce$_2$RhIn$_8$.

<h3>Anomalous frequency and temperature dependent scattering in the dilute  metallic phase in lightly doped-SrTiO$_3$</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18767" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18767</a>
<br>
</p><i>K. Santhosh Kumar, Dooyong Lee, Shivasheesh Varshney, Bharat Jalan, N. P. Armitage</i>
<p>The mechanism of superconductivity in materials with aborted ferroelectricity
and the emergence of a dilute metallic phase in systems like doped-SrTiO$_3$
are outstanding issues in condensed matter physics. This dilute metal has
features both similar and different to those found in the normal state of other
unconventional superconductors. We have investigated the optical properties of
the dilute metallic phase in doped-SrTiO$_3$ using THz time-domain
spectroscopy. At low frequencies the THz response exhibits a Drude-like form as
expected for typical metal-like conductivity. We observed the frequency and
temperature dependencies to the low energy scattering rate $\Gamma(\omega, T)
\propto (\hbar\omega)^2 + (p \pi k_BT)^2 $ expected in a conventional Fermi
liquid, despite the fact that densities are too small to allow current decay
through electron-electron scattering. However we find the lowest known $p$
values of 0.39-0.72. As $p$ is 2 in a canonical Fermi liquid and existing
models based on energy dependent elastic scattering bound $p$ from below to 1,
our observation lies outside current explanation. Our data also gives insight
into the high temperature regime and shows that the temperature dependence of
the resistivity derives in part from strong T dependent mass renormalizations.

<h3>Achieving quantized transport in Floquet topological insulators via  energy filters</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18776" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18776</a>
<br>
</p><i>Ruoyu Zhang, Frederik Nathan, Netanel H. Lindner, Mark S. Rudner</i>
<p>Due to photon-assisted transport processes, chiral edge modes induced by
periodic driving do not directly mediate quantized transport. Here we show how
narrow bandwidth "energy filters" can restore quantization by suppressing
photon assisted transport through Floquet sidebands. We derive a Floquet
Landauer type equation to describe transport through such an energy-filtered
setup, and show how the filter can be integrated out to yield a sharply
energy-dependent renormalized system-lead coupling. We show analytically and
through numerical simulations that a nearly quantized conductance can be
achieved in both off-resonantly and resonantly induced quasienergy gaps when
filters are introduced. The conductance approaches the appropriate quantized
value on each plateau with increasing system and filter size. We introduce a
"Floquet distribution function" and show both analytically and numerically that
it approaches the equilibrium Fermi-Dirac form when narrow-band filters are
introduced, highlighting the mechanism that restores quantized transport.

<h3>Nanoscale variation of the Rashba energy in BiTeI</h3>

<p>BiTeI is a polar semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that
produces large Rashba spin splitting. Due to its potential utility in
spintronics and magnetoelectrics, it is essential to understand how defects
impact the spin transport in this material. Using scanning tunneling microscopy
and spectroscopy, we image ring-like charging states of single-atom defects on
the iodine surface of BiTeI. We observe nanoscale variations in the Rashba
energy around each defect, which we correlate with the local electric field
extracted from the bias dependence of each ring radius. Our data demonstrate
the local impact of atomic defects on the Rashba effect, which is both a
challenge and an opportunity for the development of future nanoscale spintronic
devices.

<p>The recent synthesis of ruthenium trihalides Ru$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) has
enlarged the set of material candidates for Kitaev spin liquid. The realization
of Kitaev model necessitates the formation of $J=1/2$ pseudospins in the
octahedral crystal field. We use Ru $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering to investigate the evolution of multiplet structures in Ru$X_3$. We
identified quasi-elastic magnetic correlations and spin-orbit transitions to
the $J=3/2$ states without discernible trigonal splitting, thereby validating
the $J=1/2$ description of magnetism in the Ru$X_3$ family. Lineshape
broadening in RuI$_3$ provides evidence for its bulk metallicity in the
vicinity of a bandwidth-controlled metal-insulator transition. Our results
highlight the pivotal role of halogen $p$ orbitals in controlling the
electronic properties of Ru$X_3$.

<p>We report the results of the investigation of the acoustic and optical
phonons in quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors of the
transition metal phosphorus trisulfide family with Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cd as
metal atoms. The Brillouin-Mandelstam and Raman light scattering spectroscopies
were conducted at room temperature to measure the acoustic and optical phonon
frequencies close to the Brillouin zone center. The absorption and index of
refraction were measured in the visible and infrared ranges using the
reflectometry technique. We found an intriguing large variation, over ~28%, in
the acoustic phonon group velocities in this group of materials with similar
crystal structures. Our data indicate that the full-width-at-half-maximum of
the acoustic phonon peaks is strongly affected by the optical properties and
the electronic band gap. The acoustic phonon lifetime extracted for some of the
materials was correlated with their thermal properties. The obtained results
are important for understanding the layered van der Waals semiconductors and
for assessing their potential for optoelectronic and spintronic device
applications.

<h3>Surface Luttinger surfaces and Luttinger-Lifshitz transitions in  topological band structures</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18820</a>
<br>
</p><i>Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</i>
<p>The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that the surface two
phases with the same symmetries are necessarily separated by a bulk phase
transition, while breaking the symmetry unlocks a path in parameter space that
allows the phases to be connected adiabatically. Moreover, if the symmetry is
broken only on the boundary, single-particle properties are expected to be
blind to distinction between the two phases. In this work, we prove that this
expectation is incorrect. We first reveal that the single-particle
\emph{surface} Green's function contains zeros or ``LSs'' that respect the same
bulk-boundary correspondence that the well-known topological surface states do.
At non-zero temperatures, these modes contribute negatively to an effective
surface specific heat. Remarkably, the LSs survive symmetry-breaking
perturbations that destroy the surface states. Thus, a bulk topological phase
transition causes a reconstruction of Luttinger surfaces on the surface and
manifests as a discontinuity in the surface specific heat.

<h3>Learning protocols for the fast and efficient control of active matter</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Corneel Casert, Stephen Whitelam</i>
<p>We show that it is possible to learn protocols that effect fast and efficient
state-to-state transformations in simulation models of active particles. By
encoding the protocol in the form of a neural network we use evolutionary
methods to identify protocols that take active particles from one steady state
to another, as quickly as possible or with as little energy expended as
possible. Our results show that protocols identified by a flexible
neural-network ansatz, which allows the optimization of multiple control
parameters and the emergence of sharp features, are more efficient than
protocols derived recently by constrained analytical methods. Our learning
scheme is straightforward to use in experiment, suggesting a way of designing
protocols for the efficient manipulation of active matter in the laboratory.

show that the model can be described by the kinetically constrained effective
Hamiltonian, and it can be spontaneously divided into two commuting parts
dubbed Hamiltonian dimerization, which consist of a sum of constrained two-site
hopping terms acting on odd or even bonds. Specifically it is showed that each
part can be independently mapped onto the well-known PXP model, therefore the
dimerized Hamiltonian is equivalent to a two-fold PXP model. As a consequence,
we numerically demonstrate this system can host the so-called quantum many-body
scars, which present persistent dynamical revivals and ergodicity-breaking
behaviors. However in sharp contrast with traditional quantum many-body scars,
here the scarring states in our model driven by different parts of Hamiltonian
will oscillate in different periods, and those of double parts can display a
biperiodic oscillation pattern, both originating from the Hamiltonian
dimerization. Besides, the condition of off-resonance is also discussed and we
show the crossover from quantum many-body scar to ergodicity breaking utilizing
level statistics. Our model provides a platform for understanding the interplay
of Hilbert space fragmentation and the constrained quantum systems

<p>De-noising is a prominent step in the spectra post-processing procedure.
Previous machine learning-based methods are fast but mostly based on supervised
learning and require a training set that may be typically expensive in real
experimental measurements. Unsupervised learning-based algorithms are slow and
require many iterations to achieve convergence. Here, we bridge this gap by
proposing a training-set-free two-stage deep learning method. We show that the
fuzzy fixed input in previous methods can be improved by introducing an
adaptive prior. Combined with more advanced optimization techniques, our
approach can achieve five times acceleration compared to previous work.
Theoretically, we study the landscape of a corresponding non-convex linear
problem, and our results indicates that this problem has benign geometry for
first-order algorithms to converge.

<p>Two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs) or quantum spin Hall
insulators are attracting increasing attention due to their potential
applications in next-generation spintronic devices. Despite their promising
prospects, realizable 2DTIs are still limited. Recently, Ta2Pd3Te5, a
semiconducting van der Waals material, has shown spectroscopic evidence of
quantum spin Hall states. However, achieving controlled preparation of few- to
monolayer samples, a crucial step in realizing quantum spin Hall devices, has
not yet been achieved. In this work, we fabricated few- to monolayer
Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ and performed systematic thickness- and
temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy measurements. Our results demonstrate
that Raman spectra can provide valuable information to determine the thickness
of Ta2Pd3Te5 thin flakes. Moreover, our angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR)
spectroscopy measurements show that the intensities of the Raman peaks are
strongly anisotropic due to the quasi-one-dimensional atomic structure,
providing a straightforward method to determine its crystalline orientation.
Our findings may stimulate further efforts to realize quantum devices based on
few or monolayer Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$.

<p>The Kitaev honeycomb model plays a pivotal role in the quest for quantum spin
liquids, in which fractional quasiparticles would provide applications in
decoherence-free topological quantum computing. The key ingredient is the
bond-dependent Ising-type interactions, dubbed the Kitaev interactions, which
require strong entanglement between spin and orbital degrees of freedom. This
study investigates the identification and design of rare-earth materials
displaying robust Kitaev interactions. We scrutinize all possible $4f$ electron
configurations, which require up to $6+$ million intermediate states in the
perturbation processes, by developing a parallel computational program designed
for massive scale calculations. Our analysis reveals a predominant interplay
between the isotropic Heisenberg $J$ and anisotropic Kitaev $K$ interactions
across all realizations of the Kramers doublets. Remarkably, instances
featuring $4f^3$ and $4f^{11}$ configurations showcase the prevalence of $K$
over $J$, presenting unexpected prospects for exploring the Kitaev QSLs in
compounds including Nd$^{3+}$ and Er$^{3+}$, respectively. Beyond the Kitaev
model, our computational program also proves adaptable to a wide range of
$4f$-electron magnets.

<p>Motivated by the recent experimental realization of a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) of europium atoms, we investigate the self-bound droplet state
of a europium BEC with spin degrees of freedom. Under a sufficiently weak
magnetic field, the droplet has a torus shape with circulating spin vectors,
which is referred to as a magnetic vortex. The ground state transforms from the
torus to cigar shape through bistability with an increase in the magnetic
field. Dynamical change of the magnetic field causes the torus to rotate due to
the Einstein-de Haas effect. The magnetic vortices form a supersolid in a

<p>We have experimentally investigated the mechanism of the exchange bias in the
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets by means of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
together with the dynamical magnetization property. The temperature dependence
of the AC susceptibility with its frequency response indicates a glassy
transition of the magnetic property for the Te-rich FeGeTe vdW ferromagnet. We
also found that the irreversible temperature dependence in the anomalous Hall
voltage follows the Almeida-Thouless line. Moreover, the freezing temperature
of the spin-glass-like phase is found to correlate with the disappearance
temperature of the exchange bias. These important signatures suggest that the
emergence of magnetic exchange bias in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnets is
induced by the presence of the spin-glass-like state in FeGeTe. The
unprecedented insights gained from these findings shed light on the underlying
principles governing exchange bias in vdW ferromagnets, contributing to the
advancement of our understanding in this field.

<h3>Benchmarking phonon anharmonicity in machine learning interatomic  potentials</h3>

<p>Machine learning approaches have recently emerged as powerful tools to probe
structure-property relationships in crystals and molecules. Specifically,
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP) can accurately reproduce
first-principles data at a cost similar to that of conventional interatomic
potential approaches. While MLIP have been extensively tested across various
classes of materials and molecules, a clear characterization of the anharmonic
terms encoded in the MLIP is lacking. Here, we benchmark popular MLIP using the
anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian of ThO$_2$ in the fluorite crystal
structure. This anharmonic Hamiltonian was constructed from density functional
theory (DFT) using our highly accurate and efficient irreducible derivative
methods, and then used to generate molecular dynamics trajectories. This data
set was used to train three classes of MLIP: Gaussian Approximation Potentials,
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The results
were assessed by directly comparing phonons and their interactions, as well as
phonon linewidths, phonon lineshifts, and thermal conductivity. The models were
also trained on a DFT molecular dynamics dataset, demonstrating good agreement
up to fifth-order for the ANN and GNN. Our analysis demonstrates that MLIP have
great potential for accurately characterizing anharmonicity in materials
systems at a fraction of the cost of conventional first principles-based
approaches.

<p>Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking
states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials
such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of
ELC phases in a Dirac nodal line (DNL) semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. As topological
materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly
correlated, the discovery of real-space electronic nanostructures displaying
incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local nematic order are
anomalous and raise questions on the origin of emergent ELC phases.
Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry
breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave -
orthorhombic structural transition. We further show how dopants can induce
nematicity via quasiparticle scattering interference. Our results highlight the
importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material
platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and
electron correlation.

<h3>Magnetic properties of binary alloys Ni1-xMox and Ni1-yCuy close to  critical concentrations</h3>

</p><i>R.-Z. Lin, C.-H. Hsu, E.-P. Liu, W.-T. Chen, C.-L. Huang</i>
<p>The search for the ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FM QCP) has always
been a captivating research topic in the scientific community. In pursuit of
this goal, we introduced nonmagnetic transition metals to alloy with elemental
nickel, studying the magnetic properties of nickel binary alloys Ni1-xMox and
Ni1-yCuy as a function of x and y up to the critical concentrations x_cr and
y_cr at which the FM transition T_C disappears. T_C-x(y) phase diagrams were
constructed via Arrott-Noakes scaling of magnetization data. An enhanced
specific heat coefficient C/T is observed near y_cr, manifesting the effect of
quantum fluctuations near a FM-to-paramagnetic quantum phase transition. This
implies the plausible FM QCP in Ni1-yCuy. However, in the case of Ni1-xMox,
although the enhancement of the specific heat coefficient also occurs as x
approaches x_cr, spin glass behavior is observed through ac magnetic
susceptibility. This observation rules out the possibility of the existence of
the FM QCP in Ni1-xMox.

<h3>Magnetism, heat capacity and electronic structure of EuCd$_2$P$_2$ in  view of its colossal magnetoresistance</h3>

<p>The mechanism of the peculiar transport properties around the magnetic
ordering temperature of semiconducting antiferromagnetic EuCd$_2$P$_2$ is not
yet understood. With a huge peak in the resistivity observed above the N\'eel
temperature, $T_{\rm N}=10.6\,\rm K$, it exhibits a colossal magnetoresistance
effect. Recent reports on observations of ferromagnetic contributions above
$T_{\rm N}$ as well as metallic behavior below this temperature have motivated
us to perform a comprehensive characterization of this material, including its
resistivity, heat capacity, magnetic properties and electronic structure. Our
transport measurements revealed quite different temperature dependence of
resistivity with the maximum at $14\,\rm K$ instead of previously reported
$18\,\rm K$. Low-field susceptibility data support the presence of static
ferromagnetism above $T_{\rm N}$ and show a complex behavior of the material at
small applied magnetic fields. Namely, signatures of reorientation of magnetic
domains are observed up to $T=16\,\rm K$. Our magnetization measurements
indicate a magnetocrystalline anisotropy which also leads to a preferred
alignment of the magnetic clusters above $T_{\rm N}$. The momentum-resolved
photoemission experiments at temperatures from $24\,\rm K$ down to $2.5\,\rm K$
indicate the permanent presence of a fundamental band gap without change of the
electronic structure when going through $T_N$ that is in contradiction with
previous results. We performed \textit{ab initio} band structure calculations
which are in good agreement with the measured photoemission data when assuming
an antiferromagnetic ground state. Calculations for the ferromagnetic phase
show a much smaller bandgap, indicating the importance of possible
ferromagnetic contributions for the explanation of the colossal
magnetoresistance effect in the related EuZn$_2$P$_2$.

<p>Metal-oxide interfaces with poor coherency have unique properties comparing
to the bulk materials and offer broad applications in the fields of
heterogeneous catalysis, battery, and electronics. However, current
understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) atomic metal-oxide interfaces
remains limited because of their inherent structural complexity and limitations
of conventional two-dimensional imaging techniques. Here, we determine the 3D
atomic structure of metal-oxide interfaces in zirconium-zirconia nanoparticles
using atomic-resolution electron tomography. We quantitatively analyze the
atomic concentration and the degree of oxidation, and find the coherency and
translational symmetry of the interfaces are broken. Moreover, we observe
porous structures such as Zr vacancies and nano-pores and investigate their
distribution. Our findings provide a clear 3D atomic picture of metal-oxide
interface with direct experimental evidence. We anticipate this work could
encourage future studies on fundamental problems of oxides such as interfacial
structures in semiconductor and atomic motion during oxidation process.

<p>We report a comparative study of temperature-dependent photoluminescence and
structural dynamics of two perovskite semiconductors, the chalcogenide
BaZrS$_3$ (BZS) and the halide CsPbBr$_3$ (CPB). These materials have similar
crystal structures and direct band gaps, but we find that they have quite
distinct optoelectronic and vibrational properties. Both materials exhibit
thermally-activated non-radiative recombination, but the non-radiative
recombination rate in BZS is between two and four orders-of-magnitude faster
than in CPB. Raman spectroscopy reveals that the effects of phonon
anharmonicity are far more pronounced in CPB than in BZS. Further, although
both materials feature a large dielectric response due to low-energy polar
optical phonons, the phonons in CPB are substantially lower in energy than in
BZS. Our results suggest that electron-phonon coupling in BZS is more effective
at non-radiative recombination than in CPB, and that BZS may also have a
substantially higher concentration of non-radiative recombination centers than
CPB. The low defect concentration in CPB may be related to the ease of lattice
reconfiguration, typified by anharmonic bonding. It remains to be seen to what
extent these differences are inherent to the chalcogenide and halide
perovskites and to what extent they can be affected by materials processing;
comparing BZS single-crystals and thin films provides reason for optimism.

<p>Generation of second-harmonic waves is one of the universal nonlinear
phenomena that have found numerous technical applications in many modern
technologies, in particular, in photonics. This phenomenon also has great
potential in the field of magnonics, which considers the use of spin waves in
magnetic nanostructures to implement wave-based signal processing and
computing. However, due to the strong frequency dependence of the phase
velocity of spin waves, resonant phase-matched generation of second-harmonic
spin waves has not yet been achieved in practice. Here, we show experimentally
that such a process can be realized using a combination of different modes of
nano-sized spin-wave waveguides based on low-damping magnetic insulators. We
demonstrate that our approach enables efficient spatially-extended energy
transfer between interacting waves, which can be controlled by the intensity of
the initial wave and the static magnetic field. The demonstrated approach can
be used for the generation of short-wavelength spin waves that are difficult to
excite directly, as well as for the implementation of novel devices for
magnonic logic and unconventional computing.

chain reactions, the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and
correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, the maximum and minimum
values of the dimension, the multifractal spectrum function and other
characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior are found. The use of
geometric characteristics of a multifractal makes it possible to describe a
stochastic system of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles,
characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical
levels is established, which reduces to the Tsallis power law. Some

<p>We perform a comprehensive study on the role of thermal noise on the ordering
kinetics of a collection of active Brownian particles modeled using
coarse-grained conserved active model B (AMB). The ordering kinetics of the
system is studied for the critical mixture when quenched from high to a low
temperature. The structure of the growing domains changes from isolated droplet
type for AMB without noise to bi-continuous type for active model B with noise
(AMBN). Unlike the passive counterpart of the AMB, the noise is relevant for
the growth kinetics of the AMB. We use extensive numerical study, as well as
dynamic scaling hypothesis to characterize the kinetics of the system. We find
that the asymptotic growth law for AMBN is diffusive Lifshitz-Slyozov (LS)
type, whereas it was reported previously that the asymptotic growth law for the
AMB without noise is slower, with a growth exponent 4. Moreover, the kinetics
of the growing domains show a strong time dependent growth for AMBN. The growth
law shows a crossover from early time 1/3 value to intermediate time 1/4 value,
and it again traverses from 1/4 to 1/3 asymptotically. The two different
scaling functions are found for intermediate time and late time with growth law
1/4 and 1/3 respectively.

<p>Neutrons in a nuclear reactor move along trajectories corresponding to Cayley
trees associated with branching random processes. The probability of
percolation, the appearance of such a state of the Bethe lattice in which there
is at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes through
the entire lattice, corresponds to the probability of the occurrence of a
self-sustaining fission chain reaction. At a critical value of the last
probability, a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons appears. The
probability of percolation, depending on the operating time of the reactor and
its size, is associated with the criticality of the reactor. The temporal
behavior of the neutron multiplication factor is estimated. Particular
attention is paid to the early stages of the development of a self-sustaining
chain reaction of nuclear fission. The possibilities of determining the
boundaries of the critical region are indicated.

<p>Directly evaluated enhanced perturbative continuous unitary transformations
(deepCUTs) are used to calculate non-perturbatively extrapolated numerical data
for the ground-state energy and the energy gap. The data coincides with the
perturbative series up to the order with respect to which the deepCUT is
truncated. We develop a general scheme to extract quantum-critical properties
from the deepCUT data based on critical scaling and a strict correspondence
between the truncation used for deepCUT and the length scale of correlations at
the critical point. We apply our approach to transverse-field Ising models
(TFIMs) as paradigmatic systems for quantum phase transitions of various
universality classes depending on the lattice geometry and the choice of
antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic coupling. In particular, we focus on the
quantum phase diagram of the bilayer antiferromagnetic TFIM on the triangular
lattice with an Ising-type interlayer coupling. Without a field, the model is
known to host a classically disordered ground state, and in the limit of
decoupled layers it exhibits the 3d-XY 'order by disorder' transition of the
corresponding single-layer model. Our starting point for the unknown parts of
the phase diagram is a high-order perturbative calculation about the limit of
isolated dimers where the model is in a gapped phase.

</p><i>Biel Martinez, Silvano de Franceschi, Yann-Michel Niquet</i>
<p>The scalability of spin qubit devices is conditioned by qubit-to-qubit
variability. Disorder in the host materials indeed affects the wave functions
of the confined carriers, which leads to variations in their charge and spin
properties. Charge disorder in the amorphous oxides is particularly detrimental
owing to its long-range influence. Here we analyze the effects of charge traps
at the semiconductor/oxide interface, which are generally believed to play a
dominant role in variability. We consider multiple random distributions of
these interface traps and numerically calculate their impact on the chemical
potentials, detuning and tunnel coupling of two adjacent quantum dots in SiGe
heterostructure. Our results highlight the beneficial screening effect of the
metal gates. The surface of the heterostructure shall, therefore, be covered as
much as possible by the gates in order to limit variability. We propose an
alternative layout with tip-shaped gates that maximizes the coverage of the
semiconductor/oxide interface and outperforms the usual planar layout in some
regimes. This highlights the importance of design in the management of
device-to-device variability.

<p>Polycrystalline Ni-Co-Mn-Sn based ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FSMAs)
show promise as actuator materials, but their practical application involving
magnetic field induced strain (MFIS) is often limited by three factors: the
requirement for high magnetic fields (> 5 T), martensitic transition
temperature away from room temperature, and limited recovery of pre-strain
applied to the martensite phase. Current work investigates the martensitic
transition (MT) and shape memory effect under the application of magnetic field
for bulk polycrystalline Ni37Co11Mn43Sn9 alloy. The outcome of the study
reveals a metamagnetic transition from the martensitic phase to the austenitic
phase at a low field of 2.8 T at 300 K which results 0.25% spontaneous MFIS.
Interestingly, 1.3% pre-strained specimen registers a 100% recovery with the
application of magnetic field of 4.5 T. Furthermore, the pre-strained specimen
exhibited a two-way shape memory effect between a strain value of 1.0% to 1.55%
during the field loading and unloading sequences. Notably, this study also
demonstrates, to the best of our knowledge , for the first time, that the
spontaneous strain and pre-strain add together. This finding paves the way for
achieving a giant MFIS by pre-straining a Ni-Mn-Sn/In class of FSMAs which
shows large spontaneous MFIS.

<p>Amphiphilic molecules spontaneously form self-assembled structures of various
shapes depending on their molecular structures, the temperature, and other
physical conditions. The functionalities of these structures are dictated by
their formations and their properties must be evaluated for reproduction using
molecular simulations. However, the assessment of such intricate structures
involves many procedural steps. This study investigates the potential of
machine-learning models to extract structural features from mesoscale
non-ordered self-assembled structures, and suggests a methodology in which
machine-learning models for the structural analysis of self-assembled
structures are trained on particle types and coordinate data. In the proposed
approach, graph neural networks are utilised to extract local structural data
for analysis. In simulations using several hundred self-assembled structures of
up to 4050 coarse-grained particles, local structures are successfully
extracted and classified with up to 78.35 % accuracy. As the machine-learning
models learn structural characteristics without the need for human-made feature
engineering, the proposed method has important potential applications in the
field of materials science.

tight-binding model of \d_{z^2} , \d_{xy} , and \d_{x^2-y^2} orbitals. The
three corresponding bands touch each other at high symmetry K point in the case
of absence of spin-orbit interaction. The proper parameters can be obtained by
Slater-Koster parameters related to chemical bonding, \pi, \sigma, and \delta
bonds. The model calculated for these band structures make an agreement with
the same trend as discussed in DFT calculation which the hopping parameters may
be identified roughly by fermi velocity. Furthermore, the triplet fermion
occurs around K point hosting by flat band, leading to super-Klein tunnelling
and anti-super-Klein tunnelling for gapped and gapless pseudospin-1 fermion,
respectively. These may apply for nanodevices operated by spin polarization
which is more stable than that of the conventional two-dimensional materials.

<p>The effect of pressure on Raman scattering (RS) in the bulk HfS$_2$ is
investigated under hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic conditions. The RS lineshape
does not change significantly in the hydrostatic regime, showing a systematic
blueshift of the spectral features. In a non-hydrostatic environment, seven
peaks emerge in the spectrum ($P$=7 GPa) dominating the lineshape up to
$P$=10.5 GPa. The change in the RS lineshape manifests a pressure-induced phase
transition in HfS$_2$. The simultaneous observation of both low-pressure (LP)
and high-pressure (HP) related RS peaks suggests the corresponding coexistence
of two different phases over a large pressure range. We found that the
HP-related phase is metastable, persisting during the decompression cycle down
to $P$=1.2 GPa with the LP-related features finally recovering at even lower
pressures. The angle-resolved polarized RS (ARPRS) performed under $P$=7.4 GPa
revealed a strong in-plane anisotropy of both the LP-related A$_{1g}$ mode and
the HP peaks. The anisotropy is related to the possible distortion of the
structure induced by the non-hydrostatic component of the pressure. We describe
the obtained results by the influence of the non-hydrostatic pressure on the
observed phase transition. We interpret our results in terms of a distorted
$Pnma$ phase as a possible HP induced structure of HfS$_2$.

<h3>Structural Stability Hypothesis of Dual Unitary Quantum Chaos</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19096</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jonathon Riddell, Curt von Keyserlingk, Tomaž Prosen, Bruno Bertini</i>
<p>Having spectral correlations that, over small enough energy scales, are
described by random matrix theory is regarded as the most general defining
feature of quantum chaotic systems as it applies in the many-body setting and
away from any semiclassical limit. Although this property is extremely
difficult to prove analytically for generic many-body systems, a rigorous proof
has been achieved for dual-unitary circuits -- a special class of local quantum
circuits that remain unitary upon swapping space and time. Here we consider the
fate of this property when moving from dual-unitary to generic quantum circuits
focussing on the \emph{spectral form factor}, i.e., the Fourier transform of
the two-point correlation. We begin with a numerical survey that, in agreement
with previous studies, suggests that there exists a finite region in parameter
space where dual-unitary physics is stable and spectral correlations are still
described by random matrix theory, although up to a maximal quasienergy scale.
To explain these findings, we develop a perturbative expansion: it recovers the
random matrix theory predictions, provided the terms occurring in perturbation
theory obey a relatively simple set of assumptions. We then provide numerical
evidence and a heuristic analytical argument supporting these assumptions.

<h3>Selective Rotation and Attractive Persistent Currents in Anti-Dipolar  Ring Supersolids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19126" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19126</a>
<br>
</p><i>K. Mukherjee, T. Arnone Cardinale, S. M. Reimann</i>
<p>A repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate on a ring is well known to
show persistent currents. For attractive interactions, however, a bound state
may form that renders the rotation classical. Here we show that in a
multiply-connected confinement, the strong in-plane attraction of an {\it
anti-dipolar }condensate can form stacks of ring-shaped droplets which may
coherently overlap to form a supersolid along the azimuthal symmetry axis of
the system. Intriguingly, the functional behavior of the energy-angular
momentum dispersion of the anti-dipolar ring condensate differs from that of a
usual repulsive superfluid. The periodic maxima between persistent flow and the
non-rotating ground state flatten significantly and the typical pronounced
cusps in the energy dispersion also occur in the rotationally symmetric
supersolid state. A weak link results in the reduction of this minimum,
shifting it to smaller angular momenta. With an asymmetric link potential one
can selectively induce superfluid and rigid-body rotation in different layers
within the same system. This intriguing setup offers new perspectives for
atomtronics applications.

<h3>A Unified Evaluation Framework for Spiking Neural Network Hardware  Accelerators Based on Emerging Non-Volatile Memory Devices</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19139</a>
<br>
</p><i>Debasis Das, Xuanyao Fong</i>
<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
event-driven and energy-efficient computation. In recent studies, various
devices tailored for SNN synapses and neurons have been proposed, leveraging
the unique characteristics of emerging non-volatile memory (eNVM) technologies.
While substantial progress has been made in exploring the capabilities of SNNs
and designing dedicated hardware components, there exists a critical gap in
establishing a unified approach for evaluating hardware-level metrics.
Specifically, metrics such as latency, and energy consumption, are pivotal in
assessing the practical viability and efficiency of the constructed neural
network. In this article, we address this gap by presenting a comprehensive
framework for evaluating hardware-level metrics in SNNs based on non-volatile
memory devices. We systematically analyze the impact of synaptic and neuronal
components on energy consumption providing a unified perspective for assessing
the overall efficiency of the network. In this study, our emphasis lies on the
neuron and synaptic device based on magnetic skyrmions. Nevertheless, our
framework is versatile enough to encompass other emerging devices as well.
Utilizing our proposed skyrmionic devices, the constructed SNN demonstrates an
inference accuracy of approximately 98% and achieves energy consumption on the
order of pJ when processing the Modified National Institute of Standards and
Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit dataset.

<p>Inertial effects in spin dynamics emerge on picosecond time scales, giving
rise to nutational excitations at THz frequencies. Here, we describe a general
framework for investigating the precessional and nutational excitations in any
type of spin structure within linear spin-wave theory. We consider the
particular cases of planar and conical spin spirals in detail. We observe a
change in the sign of the curvature of the high-frequency nutational spin-wave
band as the spiral period is decreased when passing from the ferromagnetic to
the antiferromagnetic limit. We identify conditions for the interaction
parameters where the curvature changes sign and asymptotical flat bands are
formed.

<h3>Controlling polymer translocation with crowded medium and polymer length  asymmetry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19187" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19187</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vrinda Garg, Rejoy Mathew, Riyan Ibrahim, Kulveer Singh, Surya K. Ghosh</i>
<p>Polymer translocation in crowded environments is a ubiquitous phenomenon in
biological systems. We studied polymer translocation through a pore in free,
one-sided (asymmetric), and two-sided (symmetric) crowded environments.
Extensive Langevin dynamics simulation is employed to model the dynamics of the
flexible polymer and crowding particles. We studied how crowding size and
packing fraction play a crucial role in the translocation process. After
determining the standard scaling properties of the translocation probability,
time, and MSD, we observed that the translocation rate and bead velocities are
location-dependent as we move along the polymer backbone, even in a crowd-free
environment. Counter-intuitively, translocation rate and bead velocities showed
the opposite behavior; for example, middle monomers near the pore exhibit
maximum bead velocity and minimum translocation rate. Free energy calculation
for asymmetrically placed polymer indicates there exists a critical number of
segments that make the polymer to prefer the receiver side for translocation.
For one-sided crowding, we have identified a critical crowding size above which
there exists a non-zero probability to translocate into the crowding side
instead of the free side. Moreover, we have observed that shifting the polymer
towards the crowded side compensates for one-sided crowding, yielding an equal
probability akin to a crowder-free system. Under two-sided crowding, the
mechanism of how a slight variation in crowder size and packing fraction can
force a polymer to switch its translocation direction is proposed, which has
not been explored before. Using this control we achieved an equal translocation
probability like a crowd-free scenario. These conspicuous yet counter-intuitive
phenomena are rationalized by simple theoretical arguments based on osmotic
pressure and radial entropic forces.

<h3>Long-range translational order and hyperuniformity in two-dimensional  chiral active crystal</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19192" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19192</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yuta Kuroda, Takeshi Kawasaki, Kunimasa Miyazaki</i>
<p>We numerically study two-dimensional athermal chiral active particles at high
densities. The particles in this system perform the circular motion with
frequency $\Omega$. The system is known to undergo a nonequilibrium transition
from the absorbing phase to the diffusing fluid phase that is accompanied by
the suppression of density fluctuations called hyperuniformity [Q.-L. Lei et
al., Sci. Adv. 5, eaau7423 (2019)]. We show that the system in the fluid phase
crystallizes with increasing density. Surprisingly, the resulting crystal
possesses long-range translational order even in two dimensions due to the
suppression of the long-wavelength displacement fluctuations associated with
hyperuniformity. We also find that $\Omega = 0$ is singular, and the system
never crystallizes because, in this limit, the system can be regarded as a
quenched random system for which the lower critical dimension is known to be
$4$. Our numerical results are quantitatively explained by a linear elastic
theory.

<p>Separating heat from charge in a material is an extremely challenging task

<h3>Constrained hidden Markov models reveal further Hsp90 protein states</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Riccardo Tancredi, Antonio Feltrin, Giosuè Sardo Infirri, Simone Toso, Leonie Vollmar, Thorsten Hugel, Marco Baiesi</i>
<p>Time series of conformational dynamics in proteins are usually evaluated with
hidden Markov models (HMMs). This approach works well if the number of states
and their connectivity is known. But for the multi-domain protein Hsp90, a
standard HMM analysis with optimization of the BIC (Bayesian information
criterion) cannot explain long-lived states well. Therefore, here we employ
constrained hidden Markov models, which neglect transitions between states by
including assumptions. Gradually tuning a model with justified and focused
changes allows us to improve its effectiveness and the score of the BIC. This
became possible by analyzing time traces with several thousand observable
transitions and, therefore, superb statistics. In this scheme, we also monitor
the residences in the states reconstructed by the model, aiming to find
exponentially distributed dwell times. We show how introducing new states can
achieve these statistics but also point out limitations, e.g., for substantial
similarity of two states connected to a common neighbor. One of the states
displays the lowest free energy and is likely the idle open `waiting state', in
which Hsp90 waits for the binding of nucleotides, cochaperones, or clients.

<p>This computational research study will analyze the multi-physics of lithium
ion insertion into a silicon nanowire in an attempt to explain the
electrochemical kinetics at the nanoscale and quantum level. The electron
coherent states and a quantum field version of photon density waves will be the
joining theories that will explain the electron-photon interaction within the
lithium-silicon lattice structure. These two quantum particles will be
responsible for the photon absorption rate of silicon atoms that are
hypothesized to be the leading cause of breaking diatomic silicon covalent
bonds that ultimately leads to volume expansion. It will be demonstrated
through the combination of Maxwell stress tensor, optical amplification and
path integrals that a stochastic analyze using a variety of Poisson
distributions that the anisotropic expansion rates in the <110>, <111> and
<112> orthogonal directions confirms the findings ascertained in previous works
made by other research groups. The computational findings presented in this
work are similar to those which were discovered experimentally using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and simulation models that used density
functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD). The refractive index and
electric susceptibility parameters of lithiated silicon are interwoven in the
first principle theoretical equations and appears frequently throughout this
research presentation, which should serve to demonstrate the importance of
these parameters in the understanding of this component in lithium ion

<p>Perovskite oxides have been extensively studied for their wide range of
compositions and structures, as well as their valuable properties for various
applications. Expanding from single perovskite ABO$_3$ to double perovskite
$A_2BB^{\prime}$O$_6$ significantly enhances the ability to tailor specific
physical and chemical properties. However, the vast number of potential
compositions of $A_2BB^{\prime}$O$_6$ makes it impractical to explore them all
experimentally. In this study, we conducted high-throughput calculations to
systematically investigate the structures and stabilities of 4,900
$A_2BB^{\prime}$O$_6$ compositions (with $A$ = Ca, Sr, Ba, and La; $B$ and
$B^{\prime}$ representing metal elements) through over 42,000 density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our analysis lead to the discovery of
more than 1,500 new synthesizable $A_2BB^{\prime}$O$_6$ compounds, with over
1,100 of them exhibiting double perovskite structures, predominantly in the
$P2_1/c$ space group. By leveraging the high-throughput dataset, we developed
machine learning models that achieved mean absolute errors of 0.0444 and 0.0330
eV/atom for formation energy and decomposition energy, respectively. Using
these models, we identified 803 stable or metastable compositions beyond the
chemical space covered in our initial calculations, with 612 of them having
DFT-validated decomposition energies below 0.1 eV/atom, resulting in a success
rate of 76.2 \%. This study delineates the stability landscape of
$A_2BB^{\prime}$O$_6$ compounds and offers new insights for the exploration of
these materials.

<p>Silicon-based color centers (SiCCs) have recently emerged as a source of
quantum light that could be well combined with existing telecom-based Si
Photonics platforms. However, considering the current SiCC fabrication
processes, deterministic control over the vertical emitter position is
impossible due to the stochastic nature of the ion implantation deployed for
color center formation. To bypass this bottleneck towards high-yield
integration, we demonstrate an entirely different creation method for various
SiCCs, that relies solely on the epitaxial growth of Si and C-doped Si at
untypically low temperatures in a pristine growth environment. Careful
adjustment to the SiCC's thermal budget allows the emitters to be confined
within a layer thickness of less than 1 nm embedded at an arbitrary vertical
position within a highly crystalline Si matrix. Depending on the SiCC layer
growth conditions and doping, different types of color centers, such as W
centers, T centers, or G'-centers can be created, some of which are
particularly promising as Si-based single photon sources and for spin-photon
interfaces. We show that the zero-phonon emission from G'-center ensembles can
be conveniently tuned by changing the C-doping concentration, characterized by
a systematic wavelength shift and significant linewidth narrowing towards low
emitter densities.

renormalization of the temporal derivative contributions to the effective

<p>We investigate many-body topological and transport properties of a
one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological chain coupled to the
quantum field of a cavity mode. The quantum conductance is determined via
Green's function formalism in terms of light-matter eigenstates calculated via
exact diagonalization for a finite number of electrons. We show that the
topology of the cavity-embedded many-electron system is described by a
generalized electron-photon Zak marker. We reveal how the quantization of
transport is modified by the cavity vacuum fields for a finite-size chain and
how it is impacted by electronic disorder. Moreover, we show that
electron-photon entanglement produces dramatic differences with respect to the
prediction of mean-field theory, which strongly underestimates cavity-modified
effects.

<p>The observation of spin-dependent transmission of electrons through chiral
molecules has led to the discovery of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS).
The remarkably high efficiency of the spin polarizing effect has recently
gained significant interest due to the high potential for novel sustainable
hybrid chiral molecule magnetic applications. However, the fundamental
mechanisms underlying the chiral-induced phenomena remain to be understood
fully. In this work, we explore the impact of chirality on spin angular
momentum in hybrid metal/ chiral molecule thin film heterostructures. For this,
we inject a pure spin current via spin pumping and investigate the
spin-to-charge conversion at the hybrid chiral interface. Notably, we observe a
chiral-induced unidirectionality in the conversion. Furthermore,
angle-dependent measurements reveal that the spin selectivity is maximum when
the spin angular momentum is aligned with the molecular chiral axis. Our
findings validate the central role of spin angular momentum for the CISS
effect, paving the path toward three-dimensional functionalization of hybrid
molecule-metal devices via chirality.

<p>Connecting two half-filled quantum dots to two superconducting leads induces
a competition of bonds, with the dots forming either an interdot exchange bond
or two individual Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) screening bonds with the leads.
Defining a qubit using these singlet parity bonding states provides dot charge
noise protection, attributed to the chargeless nature of the screening
quasiparticles, and magnetic noise protection, as the bonds guard against
magnetic polarization. In this paper, we propose embedding a Double Quantum Dot
(DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit Quantum
Electrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR bond qubit. We
demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD
can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit
operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be
achieved through dot gates, and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements
of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and
estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence.
Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not
rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material
platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.

</p><i>Fang Pan, Junni Zhai, Jinyu Chen, Lin Yang, Hua Dong, Fang Yuan, Zhuangde Jiang, Wei Ren, Zuo-Guang Ye, Guo-Xu Zhang, Jingrui Li</i>
<p>Stability is one of the key issues in mixed-halide perovskite alloys which
are promising in emergent optoelectronics. Previous density-functional-theory
(DFT) and machine learning studies indicate that the formation-energy convex
hulls of these materials are very shallow, and stable alloy compositions are
rare. In this work, we revisit this problem using DFT with special focus on the
effects of configuration and vibration entropies. Allowed by the $20$-atomic
models for the $\text{CsPb}(\text{I}_{1-x}^{}\text{Br}_x^{})_3^{}$ and
$\text{CsPb}(\text{Br}_{1-x}^{}\text{Cl}_x^{})_3^{}$ series, the partition
functions and therewith thermodynamic state functions are calculated by
traversing all possible mixed-halide configurations. We can thus evaluate the
temperature- and system-dependent configuration entropy, which largely corrects
the conventional approach based on the ideal solution model. Finally,
temperature-composition phase diagrams that include $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$
and $\delta$ phases of both alloys are constructed based on the free energy
data, for which the contribution of phonon vibrations is included.

<p>Quantum dots are semiconductor nano-structures where particle motion is
confined in all three spatial dimensions. Since their first experimental
realization, nanocrystals confining the quanta of polarization waves, termed
excitons, have found numerous applications in fields ranging from single photon
sources for quantum information processing to commercial displays. A major
limitation to further extending the range of potential applications has been
the large inhomogeneity in, and lack-of tunability of, exciton energy that is
generic to quantum dot materials. Here, we address this challenge by
demonstrating electrically-defined quantum dots for excitons in monolayer
semiconductors where the discrete exciton energies can be tuned using applied
gate voltages. Resonance fluorescence measurements show strong spectral jumps
and blinking of these resonances, verifying their zero-dimensional nature. Our
work paves the way for realizing quantum confined bosonic modes where nonlinear
response would arise exclusively from exciton--exciton interactions.

<p>Detection and control of Andreev Bound States (ABSs) localized at

through a Josephson junction containing a quantum dot (QD). Additional
normal-metal tunneling probes on both sides of the junction unveil the ABSs
residing at the semi-superconductor interfaces. Such knowledge provides an
ingredient missing in previous studies, improving the connection between theory
and experimental data. By varying the ABS energies using electrostatic gates,
we show control of the switching current, with the ability to alter it by more
than an order of magnitude. Finally, the large degree of ABS tunability allows
us to realize a three-site ABS-QD-ABS molecule (Andreev trimer) in which the
central QD is screened by both ABSs. This system is studied simultaneously
using both supercurrent and spectroscopy.

<p>Equations of motion are developed for the oscillatory rotation of a disk
suspended between twisted strings kept under tension by a hanging mass, to
which additional forces may be applied. In the absence of forcing, damped
harmonic oscillations are observed to decay with an exponential time envelope
for two different string types. This is consistent with damping caused by
string viscosity, rather than air turbulence, and may be quantified in terms of
a quality factor. To test the proposed equation of motion and model for viscous
damping within the string, we measure both the natural oscillation frequency
and the quality factor for widely varied values of string length, string
radius, disk moment of inertia, and hanging mass. The data are found to scale
in good accord with predictions. A variation where rotational kinetic energy is
converted back and forth to spring potential energy is also discussed.

<p>Coupling a single spin to high-frequency mechanical motion is a fundamental
bottleneck of applications such as quantum sensing, intermediate and
long-distance spin-spin coupling, and classical and quantum information
processing. Previous experiments have only shown single spin coupling to
low-frequency mechanical resonators, such as diamond cantilevers.
High-frequency mechanical resonators, having the ability to access the quantum
regime, open a range of possibilities when coupled to single spins, including
readout and storage of quantum states. Here we report the first experimental
demonstration of spin-mechanical coupling to a high-frequency resonator. We
achieve this all-electrically on a fully suspended carbon nanotube device. A
new mechanism gives rise to this coupling, which stems from spin-orbit
coupling, and it is not mediated by strain. We observe both resonant and
off-resonant coupling as a shift and broadening of the electric dipole spin
resonance (EDSR), respectively. We develop a complete theoretical model taking
into account the tensor form of the coupling and non-linearity in the motion.
Our results propel spin-mechanical platforms to an uncharted regime. The
interaction we reveal provides the full toolbox for promising applications
ranging from the demonstration of macroscopic superpositions, to the operation
of fully quantum engines, to quantum simulators.

<h3>Linear stability of cylindrical, multicomponent vesicles</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19297</a>
<br>
</p><i>Anirudh Venkatesh, Aman Bhargava, Vivek Narsimhan</i>
<p>Vesicles are important surrogate structures made up of multiple phospholipids
and cholesterol distributed in the form of a lipid bilayer. Tubular vesicles
can undergo pearling i.e., formation of beads on the liquid thread akin to the
Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Previous studies have inspected the effects of
surface tension on the pearling instabilities of single-component vesicles. In
this study, we perform a linear stability analysis on a multicomponent
cylindrical vesicle. We solve the Stokes equations along with the Cahn-Hilliard
equations to develop the linearized dynamic equations governing the vesicle
shape and surface concentration fields. This helps us show that multicomponent
vesicles can undergo pearling, buckling, and wrinkling even in the absence of
surface tension, which is a significantly different result from studies on
single-component vesicles. This behaviour arises due to the competition between
the free energies of phase separation, line tension, and bending for this
multi-phospholipid system. We determine the conditions under which axisymmetric
and non-axisymmetric modes are dominant, and supplement our results with an
energy analysis that shows the sources for these instabilities. We further show
that these trends qualitatively match recent experiments.

<h3>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects in an Antiferromagnetic Spin  Chain</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shuntaro Sumita, Akihiro Tanaka, Yusuke Kato</i>
<p>Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in
the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the
relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case
with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit
often provides deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed
matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating
such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic
interactions, a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom
implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the
magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an
anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along
the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization
curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.

<h3>Basolateral mechanics prevents rigidity transition in epithelial  monolayers</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19312" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19312</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jan Rozman, Matej Krajnc, Primož Ziherl</i>
<p>The mechanics of epithelial tissues, which is governed by forces generated in
various cell domains, is often investigated using two-dimensional models that
account for the apically-positioned actomyosin structures but neglect
basolateral mechanics. We employ a more detailed three-dimensional model to
study how lateral surface tensions affect the structure and rigidity of such
tissues. We find that cells are apicobasally asymmetric, with one side
appearing more ordered than the other depending on cell target perimeter. In
contrast to the 2D model, which predicts a rigidity transition at large target
perimeters, tissues in the 3D model remain solid-like across all parameter
space.

<h3>Taut-Line Buzzers with Periodic Forcing</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19316" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19316</a>
<br>
</p><i>Jesse M. Hanlan, Douglas J. Durian</i>
<p>The time-dependent forcing and work per cycle required to drive sinusoidal
spinning of a taut-line buzzer is analytically derived, both on and off
resonance, from the nonlinear equation of motion. To test predictions, a model
experimental system is constructed and characterized in terms of contraction
versus twist angle and damped oscillations. The predicted force profile is then
approximately implemented by hand. Nearly sinusoidal motion is observed, and
the energy injection per cycle needed to maintain steady state oscillations is
found to agree with theory. Additional force profiles are implemented, one to
maximize non-sinusoidal response and one to maximize the response per operator
effort. With the latter, an Aluminum disk of radius 5~cm and height 0.95~cm was
spun at a peak speed of over 11,000~RMP for fifteen minutes. The corresponding
hand-powered centrifuge system would required $1.5\times$ more force, twice the
power, and triple the time in order to run $90\times$ more samples than prior
state-of-art.

<h3>GPTFF: A high-accuracy out-of-the-box universal AI force field for  arbitrary inorganic materials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Fankai Xie, Tenglong Lu, Sheng Meng, Miao Liu</i>
<p>This study introduces a novel AI force field, namely graph-based pre-trained
transformer force field (GPTFF), which can simulate arbitrary inorganic systems
with good precision and generalizability. Harnessing a large trove of the data
and the attention mechanism of transformer algorithms, the model can accurately
predict energy, atomic forces, and stress with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values
of 32 meV/atom, 71 meV/{\AA}, and 0.365 GPa, respectively. The dataset used to
train the model includes 37.8 million single-point energies, 11.7 billion force
pairs, and 340.2 million stresses. We also demonstrated that GPTFF can be
universally used to simulate various physical systems, such as crystal
structure optimization, phase transition simulations, and mass transport.

<h3>Robust nodal behavior in the thermal conductivity of superconducting  UTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ian M. Hayes, Tristin E. Metz, Corey E. Frank, Shanta R. Saha, Nicholas P. Butch, Vivek Mishra, Peter J. Hirschfeld, Johnpierre Paglione</i>
<p>The superconducting state of the heavy-fermion metal UTe$_2$ has attracted
considerable interest because of evidence for spin-triplet Cooper pairing and
non-trivial topology. Progress on these questions requires identifying the
presence or absence of nodes in the superconducting gap function and their
dimension. In this article we report a comprehensive study of the influence of
disorder on the thermal transport in the superconducting state of UTe$_2$.
Through detailed measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the thermal
conductivity in the zero-temperature limit, we obtain clear evidence for the
presence of point nodes in the superconducting gap for all samples with
transition temperatures ranging from 1.6~K to 2.1~K obtained by different
synthesis methods, including a refined self-flux method. This robustness
implies the presence of symmetry-imposed nodes throughout the range studied,
further confirmed via disorder-dependent calculations of the thermal transport
in a model with a single pair of nodes. In addition to capturing the
temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity up to $T_c$, this model
allows us to limit the possible locations of the nodes, suggesting a B$_{1u}$
or B$_{2u}$ symmetry for the superconducting order parameter. Additionally,
comparing the new, ultra-high conductivity samples to older samples reveals a
crossover between a low-field and a high field regime at a single value of the
magnetic field in all samples. In the high field regime, the thermal
conductivity at different disorder levels differ from each other by a simple
offset, suggesting that some simple principle determines the physics of the
mixed state, a fact which may illuminate trends observed in other clean nodal
superconductors.

<h3>Stress-controlled medium-amplitude oscillatory shear (MAOStress) of  PVA-Borax</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19357</a>
<br>
</p><i>Nabil Ramlawi, Mohammad Tanver Hossain, Abhishek Shetty, Randy H. Ewoldt</i>
<p>We report the first-ever complete measurement of MAOStress material
functions, which reveal that stress can be more fundamental than strain or
strain rate for understanding linearity limits as a function of Deborah number.
The material used is a canonical viscoelastic liquid with a single dominant
relaxation time: Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer solution crosslinked with
tetrahydroborate (Borax) solution. We outline experimental limit lines and
their dependence on geometry and test conditions. These MAOStress measurements
enable us to observe the frequency dependence of the weakly nonlinear deviation
as a function of stress amplitude. The observed features of MAOStress material
functions are distinctly simpler than MAOStrain, where the frequency dependence
is much more dramatic. The strain-stiffening transient network model (SSTNM)
was used to derive a model-informed normalization of the nonlinear material
functions that accounts for their scaling with the linear material properties.
Moreover, we compare the frequency-dependence of the critical stress, strain,
and strain-rate for the linearity limit, which are rigorously computed from the
MAOStress and MAOStrain material functions. While critical strain and
strain-rate change by orders of magnitude throughout the Deborah number range,
the critical stress changes by a factor of about two, showing that stress is a
more fundamental measure of nonlinearity strength. This work extends the
experimental accessibility of the weakly nonlinear regime to stress-controlled
instruments and deformations, which reveal material physics beyond linear
viscoelasticity but at conditions that are accessible to theory and detailed
simulation.

Kouwenhoven, Grzegorz P. Mazur</i>
<p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are non-Abelian excitations predicted to emerge at
the edges of topological superconductors. One proposal for realizing a
topological superconductor in one dimension involves a chain of spinless
fermions, coupled through $p$-wave superconducting pairing and electron
hopping. This concept is also known as the Kitaev chain. A minimal two-site
Kitaev chain has recently been experimentally realized using quantum dots (QDs)
coupled through a superconductor. In such a minimal chain, MZMs are
quadratically protected against global perturbations of the QD electrochemical
potentials. However, they are not protected from perturbations of the inter-QD
couplings. In this work, we demonstrate that extending the chain to three sites
offers greater protection than the two-site configuration. The enhanced
protection is evidenced by the stability of the zero-energy modes, which is
robust against variations in both the coupling amplitudes and the
electrochemical potential variations in the constituent QDs. While our device
offers all the desired control of the couplings it does not allow for
superconducting phase control. Our experimental observations are in good
agreement with numerical simulated conductances with phase averaging. Our work
pioneers the development of longer Kitaev chains, a milestone towards
topological protection in QD-based chains.

<h3>A-15 type superconducting hydride La4H23: Nanograined structure with low  strain, strong electron-phonon interaction, and moderate level of  nonadiabaticity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19384" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19384</a>
<br>
</p><i>E.F. Talantsev, V.V. Chistyakov</i>
<p>For seven decades by A-15 superconductors we meant metallic A3B alloys (where
A is a transition metal, and B is groups IIIB and IVB element) discovered by
Hardy and Hulm (Phys. Rev. 89, 884 (1953)). Nb3Ge exhibited the highest
superconducting transition temperature, Tc = 23 K, among these alloys. One of
these alloys, Nb3Sn, is primary material in modern applied superconductivity.
Recently Guo et al (arXiv:2307.13067) extended the family of superconductors
where the metallic ions arranged in the beta tungsten (A-15) sublattice by
observation of Tc,zero = 81 K in La4H23 phase compressed at P = 118 GPa.
Despite the La4H23 has much lower Tc in comparison with near-room-temperature
superconducting LaH10 phase (Tc,zero = 250 K at P ~ 200 GPa) discovered by
Drozdov et al (Nature 569, 531 (2019)), the La4H23 holds the record high Tc
within A-15 family. Cross et al (Phys. Rev. B 109, L020503 (2024)) confirmed
the high-temperature superconductivity in the compressed La4H23. In this paper,
we analyzed available experimental data measured in La4H23 and found that this
superconductor exhibits nanograined structure, 6 nm < D < 27 nm, low
crystalline strain < 0.005, high electron-phonon coupling constant, 1.5 <
$\lambda_{e-ph}$ < 2.7, and moderate level of the nonadiabaticity
$\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$. We found that derived $\Theta_{D}/T_{F}$ and $T_c/T_F$
values for the La4H23 phase are similar to the ones in cuprates, pnictides, and
near-room-temperature superconductors H3S and LaH10, which implies that the
La4H23 phase falls to unconventional superconductors band in the Uemura plot.

<p>Information propagation in the one-dimensional infinite temperature Hubbard
model with a dissipative particle sink at the end of a semi-infinite chain is
studied. In the strongly interacting limit, the two-site mutual information and
the operator entanglement entropy exhibit a rich structure with two propagating
information fronts and superimposed interference fringes. A classical
reversible cellular automaton model quantitatively captures the transport and
the slow, classical part of the correlations, but fails to describe the rapidly
propagating information jet. The fast quantum jet resembles coherent free
particle propagation, with the accompanying long-ranged interference fringes
that are exponentially damped by short-ranged spin correlations in the
many-body background.

<h3>Ab initio elasticity at finite temperature and stress in ferroelectrics</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Mark A. Mathis, Chris A. Marianetti</i>
<p>Computing the temperature and stress dependence of the full elastic constant
tensor from first-principles in non-cubic materials remains a challenging
problem. Here we circumvent the aforementioned challenge via the generalized
quasiharmonic approximation in conjunction with the irreducible derivative
approach for computing strain dependent phonons using finite difference,
explicitly including dipole-quadrupole contributions. We showcase this approach
in ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ using density functional theory, computing all
independent elastic constants and piezoelectric strain coefficients at finite
temperature and stress. There is good agreement between the quasiharmonic
approximation and the experimental lattice parameters close to 0 K. However,
the quasiharmonic approximation overestimates the temperature dependence of the
lattice parameters and elastic constant tensor, demonstrating that a higher
level of strain dependent anharmonic vibrational theory is needed.

<h3>Magnon spectrum of altermagnets: Time-dependent matrix product states  vs. linearized Holstein-Primakoff calculations unravelling spontaneous magnon  decay</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19433</a>
<br>
</p><i>Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Ali Kefayati, John Q. Xiao, Branislav K. Nikolic</i>
<p>The energy-momentum dispersion of magnons, viewed as noninteracting and
infinitely long-lived quasiparticles describing collective low-energy
excitations of magnetic materials, is often presented as sharp bands obtained
from the effective quantum spin Hamiltonian, after being simplified via
linearized Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformations. However, magnons are prone
to many-body interactions with other quasiparticles which can lead to their
spontaneous decay. The magnon-magnon interactions could affect newly classified
altermagnets. On the other hand, sharp bands of noninteracting chiral magnons
in RuO2, as the canonical example of altermagnets, have been very recently
predicted. Here, we employ nonperturbative numerically (quasi)exact quantum
many-body calculations, via time-dependent matrix product states (TDMPS), to
obtain magnon spectral function of RuO2. These calculations produce a broadened
magnon dispersion, which overlaps with linearized HP theory sharp bands only at
edges/center of the Brillouin zone. Substantially deviating otherwise.
Artificially making exchange interaction within two sublattices of RuO2 closer
in value forces these two spectra to overlap, thereby explaining the origin of
the failure of linearized HP theory. Such features translate into the
difference between their respective density of states, which we also compute
and which could be tested by Raman scattering experiments. Finally, we employ
popular Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation-based classical atomistic spin
dynamics (ASD) simulations to obtain dynamical structure factor and extract
magnon spectrum from it at finite temperature. Despite including magnon-magnon
interactions via nonlinearity of LLG equation, ASD simulations cannot fully
match the TDMPS-computed magnon spectrum due to nonclassical effects harbored
by altermagnets.

<p>We highlight the importance of long-range correlations in active matter
systems of dilute self-propelling particles even in the absence of global order
by demonstrating that long-range density fluctuations are suppressed. We show

<h3>First-principles electron-phonon interactions and electronic transport  in large-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shiyuan Gao, Jin-Jian Zhou, Yao Luo, Marco Bernardi</i>
<p>Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) has emerged as an exciting platform for novel
condensed matter physics. However, electron-phonon ($e$-ph) interactions in
tBLG and their effects on electronic transport are not completely understood.
Here we show first-principles calculations of $e$-ph interactions and
resistivity in commensurate tBLG with large twist angles of 13.2 and 21.8
degrees. These calculations overcome key technical barriers, including large
unit cells of up to 76 atoms, Brillouin-zone folding of the $e$-ph
interactions, and unstable lattice vibrations due to the AA-stacked domains. We
show that $e$-ph interactions due to layer-breathing (LB) phonons enhance
intervalley scattering in large-angle tBLG. This interaction effectively
couples the two layers, which are otherwise electronically decoupled at such
large twist angles. As a result, the phonon-limited resistivity in tBLG
deviates from the temperature-linear trend characteristic of monolayer graphene
and tBLG near the magic angle. Taken together, our work quantifies $e$-ph
interactions and scattering mechanisms in tBLG, revealing subtle interlayer
coupling effects at large twist angles.

<p>In bulk Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, the strong sensitivity of the superconducting
transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ to nonmagnetic impurities provides robust
evidence for a superconducting order parameter that changes sign around the
Fermi surface. In superconducting epitaxial thin-film Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, the
relationship between $T_{\text{c}}$ and the residual resistivity $\rho_0$,
which in bulk samples is taken to be a proxy for the low-temperature elastic
scattering rate, is far less clear. Using high-energy electron irradiation to
controllably introduce point disorder into bulk single-crystal and thin-film
Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, we show that $T_{\text{c}}$ is suppressed in both systems at
nearly identical rates. This suggests that part of $\rho_0$ in films comes from
defects that do not contribute to superconducting pairbreaking, and establishes
a quantitative link between the superconductivity of bulk and thin-film
samples.

<p>We present a natural language processing pipeline that was used to extract
polymer solar cell property data from the literature and simulate various
active learning strategies. While data-driven methods have been well
established to discover novel materials faster than Edisonian trial-and-error
approaches, their benefits have not been quantified. Our approach demonstrates
a potential reduction in discovery time by approximately 75 %, equivalent to a
15 year acceleration in material innovation. Our pipeline enables us to extract
data from more than 3300 papers which is ~5 times larger than similar data sets
reported by others. We also trained machine learning models to predict the
power conversion efficiency and used our model to identify promising
donor-acceptor combinations that are as yet unreported. We thus demonstrate a
workflow that goes from published literature to extracted material property
data which in turn is used to obtain data-driven insights. Our insights include
active learning strategies that can simultaneously optimize the material system
and train strong predictive models of material properties. This work provides a
valuable framework for research in material science.

<h3>Topological flat bands, valley polarization, and interband  superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximitized  spin-orbit couplings</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Yang-Zhi Chou, Yuting Tan, Fengcheng Wu, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<p>We study theoretically the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with
proximity-induced Ising and Rashba spin-orbit couplings on the top layer. We
demonstrate topological flat bands and identify three distinct topological
phases. Using a weak coupling analysis, we find that (partial) valley
polarization prevails for a wide range of doping, suppressing the usual
superconductivity with a pairing between time-reversal partners. Remarkably, we
uncover that observable unconventional intervalley interband phonon-mediated
superconductivity (with the highest $T_c\approx 1.2$K) can coexist with strong
valley imbalance due to the approximate Fermi surface nesting between two flat
bands not related by time-reversal symmetry, and the dominant pairing is an
intersublattice Ising pairing, corresponding to a mixture of $p$- and
$d$-waves. In contrast, the intrasublattice Ising phonon-mediated
superconductivity with $s$- and $f$-wave mixing emerges in the absence of
valley imbalance. Our work reveals a novel route of realizing unconventional
superconductivity, and potentially explains the superconductivity phenomenology
in existing experiments.

<p>Spin-valley properties in two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) has attracted significant interest due to the
possible applications in quantum computing. Spin-valley properties can be
exploited in TMDC quantum dot (QD) with well-resolved energy levels. This
requires smaller QDs, especially in material systems with heavy carrier
effective mass e.g. TMDCs and silicon. Device architectures employed for TMDC
QDs so far have difficulty achieving smaller QDs. Therefore, an alternative
approach in the device architecture is needed. Here, we propose a multilayer
device architecture to achieve a gate-defined QD in TMDC with a relatively
large energy splitting on the QD. We provide a range of device dimensions and
dielectric thicknesses and its correlation with the QD energy splitting. The
device architecture is modeled realistically. Moreover, we show that all the
device parameters used in modeling are experimentally achievable. These studies
lay the foundation for future work toward spin-valley qubits in TMDCs. The
successful implementation of these device architectures will drive the
technological development of 2D materials-based quantum technologies.
