<h3>Realization of Hilbert Space Fragmentation and Fracton Dynamics in 2D</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05695" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05695</a>
<br>
<i>Melissa Will, Roderich Moessner, Frank Pollmann</i>
<p>We propose the strongly tilted Bose-Hubbard model as a natural platform to
explore Hilbert-space fragmentation (HSF) and fracton dynamics in
two-dimensions, in a setup and regime readily accessible in optical lattice
experiments. Using a perturbative ansatz, we find HSF when the model is tuned
to the resonant limit of on-site interaction and tilted potential. First, we
investigate the quench dynamics of this system and observe numerically that the
relaxation dynamics strongly depends on the chosen initial state -- one of the
key signature of HSF. Second, we identify fractonic excitations with restricted
mobility leading to anomalous transport properties. Specifically, we find
excitations that show one dimensional diffusion (z = 1/2) as well as
excitations that show subdiffusive behaviour in two dimensions (z = 3/4). Using
a cellular automaton, we analyze their dynamics and compare to an effective
hydrodynamic description.

<h3>Confinement induced three-dimensional trajectories of microswimmers in  rectangular channels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05757" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05757</a>
<br>
<i>Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Ahana Purushothaman, Ranabir Dey, Sumesh P Thampi</i>
<p>We study the trajectories of a model microorganism inside three-dimensional
channels with square and rectangular cross-sections. Using (i) numerical
simulations based on lattice-Boltzmann method, and (ii) analytical expressions
using far-field hydrodynamic approximations and method of images we
systematically investigate the role of the strength and finite-size of the
squirmer, confinement dimensions, and initial conditions in determining the
three dimensional trajectories of microswimmers. Our results indicate that the
hydrodynamic interactions with the confining walls of the channel significantly
affect the swimming speed and trajectory of the model microswimmer.
Specifically, pullers always display sliding motion inside the channel: weak
pullers slide through the channel centerline, while strong pullers slide
through a path close to any of the walls. Pushers generally follow helical
motion in a square channel. Unlike pullers and pushers, the trajectories of
neutral swimmers are not easy to generalize, and are sensitive to the initial
conditions. Despite this diversity in the trajectories, the far-field
expressions capture the essential features of channel-confined swimmers.
Finally, we propose a method based on the principle of superposition to
understand the origin of the three-dimensional trajectories of channel confined
swimmers. Such construction allows us to predict and justify the origin of
apparently complex 3D trajectories generated by different types of swimmers in
channels with square and rectangular cross sections.

<h3>Stochastic kinetic theory applied to coarse-grained polymer model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06091" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06091</a>
<br>
<i>Shangren Zhu, Patrick T. Underhill</i>
<p>A stochastic field theory approach is applied to a coarse-grained polymer
model that will enable studies of polymer behavior under non-equilibrium
conditions. This article is focused on the validation of the new model in
comparison to explicit Langevin equation simulations under conditions with
analytical solutions. The polymers are modeled as Hookean dumbbells in one
dimension, without including hydrodynamic interactions and polymer-polymer
interactions. Stochastic moment equations are derived from the full field
theory. The accuracy of the field theory and moment equations are quantified
using autocorrelation functions. The full field theory is only accurate for
large number of polymers due to keeping track of rare occurrences of polymers
with a large stretch. The moment equations do not have this error because they
do not explicitly track these configurations. The accuracy of both methods
depends on the spatial degree of discretization. The timescale of decorrelation
over length scales bigger than the spatial discretization is accurate, while
there is an error over the scale of single mesh points.

<h3>Are microbial biosurfactants actually only surfactants?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05630" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05630</a>
<br>
<i>Niki Baccile</i>
<p>The term biosurfactants refers to a complex mixture of metabolites with
surface-active properties produced by specific microorganisms. However,
nowadays trends moves towards isolation, screening and purifying single
biocompatible, biodegradable biosurfactants with high commercialization
potential. Current legislation limiting petrochemicals combined with
environmentally concerned consumers did not only stimulate research and
development but it also promoted large-scale production of this class of
molecules. However, recent data recorded on single congeners question the
actual pertinence of using the word ''biosurfactant'' associated to these
molecules. By evaluating the accepted characteristics of surfactants and
comparing them to the actual self-assembly and bulk properties in water of
molecules traditionally called ''biosurfactants'', this opinion paper aims at
showing that the term ''biosurfactant'' can be somewhat reductive when applied
to specific individual compounds produced by fermentation. The use of a more
generic term, like bioamphiphile could probably be more pertinent and
appropriate for consideration in the future.

<h3>3D Printed Architectured Silicones with Autonomic Self-healing and  Creep-resistant Behavior</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05633" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05633</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Menasce, Rafael Libanori, Fergal Coulter, Andr√© R. Studart</i>
<p>Self-healing silicones that are able to restore the functionalities and
extend the lifetime of soft devices hold great potential in many applications.
However, currently available silicones need to be triggered to self-heal or
suffer from creep-induced irreversible deformation during use. Here, we design
and print silicone objects that are programmed at the molecular and
architecture levels to achieve self-healing at room temperature while
simultaneously resisting creep. At the molecular scale, dioxaborolanes moieties
are incorporated into silicones to synthesize self-healing vitrimers, whereas
conventional covalent bonds are exploited to make creep-resistant elastomers.
When combined into architectured printed parts at a coarser length scale,
layered materials exhibit fast healing at room temperature without compromising
the elastic recovery obtained from covalent polymer networks. A
patient-specific vascular phantom is printed to demonstrate the potential of
architectured silicones in creating damage-resilient functional devices using
molecularly designed elastomer materials.

<h3>Gallai-Edmonds percolation of topologically protected collective  Majorana excitations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05634" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05634</a>
<br>
<i>Ritesh Bhola, Kedar Damle</i>
<p>Majorana networks, whose vertices represent localized Majorana modes and
edges correspond to bilinear mixing amplitudes between them, provide a unified
framework for describing the low energy physics of several interesting systems.
Such networks are known to exhibit topologically protected collective Majorana
modes if the combinatorial problem of maximum matchings (maximally-packed dimer
covers) of the underlying graph has unmatched vertices (monomers), as is
typically the case if the network is disordered. These collective Majorana
modes live in ``${\mathcal R}$-type regions'' of the disordered graph, which
host the unmatched vertices (monomers) in any maximum matching and can be
identified using the graph theoretical Gallai-Edmonds decomposition. Here, we
focus on vacancy disorder (site dilution) in general (nonbipartite) two
dimensional lattices such as the triangular and Shastry-Sutherland lattices,
and study the random geometry of such ${\mathcal R}$-type regions and their
complements, i.e., ``${\mathcal P}$-type regions'' from which monomers are
excluded in any maximum matching of the lattice. These ${\mathcal R}$-type and
${\mathcal P}$-type regions are found to display a sharply-defined {\em
Gallai-Edmonds percolation} transition at a critical vacancy density $n_v^{\rm
crit}$ that lies well within the geometrically percolated phase of the
underlying disordered lattice. For $n_v<n_v^{\rm crit}$, ${\mathcal R}$-type
regions percolate but there is a striking lack of self-averaging even in the
thermodynamic limit, with the ensemble average being macroscopically different
from the properties of individual samples: Each sample has exactly one infinite
cluster, which is of type ${\mathcal R}$ ($\mathcal P$) in a weakly
$n_v$-dependent fraction $f <1$ ($1-f < 1$) of the samples.

<h3>Surface instabilities generated by a slider pulled across a granular bed</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05635" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05635</a>
<br>
<i>Antoine Dop, Val√©rie Vidal, Nicolas Taberlet</i>
<p>We report an instability of a slider slowly dragged at the surface of a
granular bed in a quasistatic regime. The boat-shaped slider sits on the
granular medium under its own weight and is free to translate vertically and to
rotate around the pitch axis while a constant horizontal speed is imposed. For
a wide range of parameters (mass, length, shape, velocity) a regular pattern of
peaks and troughs spontaneously emerges as the slider travels forward. This
instability is studied through experiments using a conveyor belt and by means
of two-dimensional discrete elements method simulations. We show that the
wavelength and amplitude of the pattern scale as the length of the slider. We
also observe that the ripples disappear for low and high masses, indicating an
optimal confining pressure. The effect of the shape, more specifically the
inclination of the front spatula, is studied and found to drastically influence
both the wavelength and the amplitude. Finally, we show that the mechanical
details (friction, cohesion) of the contact point between the slider and the
pulling device is critical and remains to be fully understood.

<h3>Satin Non-Woven Fabrics for Designing of Self-Regulating Breathable  Building Skins</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05639</a>
<br>
<i>Saied Zarrinmehr, Ergun Akleman, Tahir Cagin</i>
<p>In this paper, we introduce the concept of 2-way 2-fold genus-1 non-woven
fabrics that can be used to design self-regulating breathable building skins.
The advantage of non-woven structures over woven structures for breathable skin
design is that they can completely be closed to stop air exchange. We have
developed a theoretical framework for such non-woven structures starting from
the mathematical theory of biaxial 2-fold Genus-1 woven fabrics. By
re-purposing a mathematical notation that is used to describe 2-fold 2-way
2-fold genus-1 woven fabrics, we identify and classify non-woven fabrics.
Within this classification, we have identified a special subset that
corresponds to satin woven fabrics and allows for maximum air exchange. Any
other subset of non-woven structures that correspond to other classical 2-way
2-fold genus-1 fabrics, such as plain or twill, will allow for less air
exchange. We also show that there exists another subset of satin non-woven
fabrics that can provide the biggest openings.

<h3>Higher-group symmetry of (3+1)D fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory:  logical CCZ, CS, and T gates from higher symmetry</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05674" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05674</a>
<br>
<i>Maissam Barkeshli, Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi</i>
<p>It has recently been understood that the complete global symmetry of finite
group topological gauge theories contains the structure of a higher-group. Here
we study the higher-group structure in (3+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with
an emergent fermion, and point out that pumping chiral $p+ip$ topological
states gives rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ 0-form symmetry with mixed
gravitational anomaly. This ordinary symmetry mixes with the other higher
symmetries to form a 3-group structure, which we examine in detail. We then
show that in the context of stabilizer quantum codes, one can obtain logical
CCZ and CS gates by placing the code on a discretization of $T^3$ (3-torus) and
$T^2 \rtimes_{C_2} S^1$ (2-torus bundle over the circle) respectively, and
pumping $p+ip$ states. Our considerations also imply the possibility of a
logical $T$ gate by placing the code on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and pumping a $p+ip$
topological state.

<h3>Dynamics of spin glass formation under tunable fluctuations in  frustrated cavity QED experiments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05682" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05682</a>
<br>
<i>Hossein Hosseinabadi, Darrick E. Chang, Jamir Marino</i>
<p>We solve the dynamics of multi-mode cavity QED with frustrated atom-photon
couplings using non-perturbative diagrammatics. Our technique enables a
thorough investigation of the nature of the spin glass transition hosted in
these platforms. We focus in particular on the role of quantum noise in each of
the atomic ensembles which form the frustrated spin network modeling the
experiment. We report on the stabilizing effect of strong quantum fluctuations
in fostering a glassy phase over extended time scales. At variance with this
behaviour, in the semi-classical limit, spin glass order is instead
pre-thermally obstructed by the ferromagnetic correlations present at the level
of individual atomic ensembles, which substantially delay spin glass formation.
Our results set the stage for studying cavity QED experiments with tunable
quantum fluctuations, and accompanying them in the transition from
semi-classical to strongly correlated operational regimes.

<h3>Measuring the boundary gapless state and criticality via disorder  operator</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05690" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05690</a>
<br>
<i>Zenan Liu, Rui-Zhen Huang, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan, Dao-Xin Yao</i>
<p>The disorder operator is often designed to reveal the conformal field theory
(CFT) information in the quantum many-body system. By using large-scale quantum
Monte Carlo simulation, we study the scaling behavior of disorder operator on
the boundary in the two-dimensional Heisenberg model on the square-octagon
lattice with gapless topological edge state. In the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki
(AKLT) phase, the disorder operator is shown to hold the perimeter scaling with
a logarithmic term associated with the Luttinger Liquid parameter K. This
effective Luttinger Liquid parameter K reflects the low energy physics and CFT
for (1+1)d boundary. At bulk critical point, the effective K is suppressed but
keep finite value, indicating the coupling between the gapless edge state and
bulk fluctuation. The logarithmic term numerically capture this coupling
picture, which reveals the (1+1)d SU(2)_1 CFT and (2+1)d O(3) CFT at boundary
criticality. Our work paves a new way to study the exotic boundary state and
boundary criticality.

<h3>Electronic g-factor and tunable spin-orbit coupling in a gate-defined  InSbAs quantum dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05693" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05693</a>
<br>
<i>S. Metti, C. Thomas, M. J. Manfra</i>
<p>We investigate transport properties of stable gate-defined quantum dots
formed in an InSb$_{0.87}$As$_{0.13}$ quantum well. High $\textit{g}$-factor
and strong spin-orbit-coupling make InSb$_x$As$_{1-x}$ a promising platform for
exploration of topological superconductivity and spin-based devices. We extract
a nearly isotropic in-plane effective $\textit{g}$-factor by studying the
evolution of Coulomb blockade peaks and differential conductance as a function
of the magnitude and direction of magnetic field. The in-plane
$\textit{g}$-factors, $|g^*_{[1\bar{1}0]}|$ and $|g^*_{[110]}|$, range from 49
- 58. Interestingly, this $\textit{g}$-factor is higher than that found in
quantum dots fabricated from pure InSb quantum wells. We demonstrate tunable
spin-orbit-coupling by tracking a spin-orbit-coupling mediated avoided level
crossing between the ground state and an excited state in magnetic field. By
increasing the electron density, we observed an increase in an avoided crossing
separation, $\Delta_{SO}$. The maximum energy separation extracted is
$\Delta_{SO}$$\sim$100 $\mu$eV.

<h3>Rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05696</a>
<br>
<i>Abhinendra Singh, Christopher Ness, Abhishek K. Sharma, Juan J. de Pablo, Heinrich M. Jaeger</i>
<p>We study the rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions using
particle-based simulation, mapping the viscosity as a function of the size
ratio of the species, their relative abundance, and the overall solid content.
The variation of the viscosity with applied stress exhibits paradigmatic shear
thickening phenomenology irrespective of composition, though the
stress-dependent limiting solids fraction governing the viscosity and its
divergence point are non-monotonic in the mixing ratio. Contact force data
demonstrate an exchange in dominant stress contribution from large-large to
small-small particle contacts as the mixing ratio of the species evolves.
Combining a prior model for shear thickening with one for composition-dependent
jamming, we obtain a full description of the rheology of bidisperse
non-Brownian suspensions capable of predicting effects such as the viscosity
reduction observed upon adding small particle fines to a suspension of large
particles.

<h3>Signature of surface anisotropy in the spin-flip neutron scattering  cross section of spherical nanoparticles: atomistic simulations and  analytical theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05706" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05706</a>
<br>
<i>Michael P. Adams, Evelyn Pratami Sinaga, Hamid Kachkachi, Andreas Michels</i>
<p>We investigate the signature of magnetic surface anisotropy in nanoparticles
in their spin-flip neutron scattering cross section. Taking into account the
isotropic exchange interaction, an external magnetic field, a uniaxial or cubic
magnetic anisotropy for the particle's core, and several models for the surface
anisotropy (N\'eel, conventional, random), we compute the spin-flip small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) cross section from the equilibrium spin structures
obtained using the Landau-Lifshitz equation. The sign of the surface anisotropy
constant, which is related to the appearance of tangential- or radial-like spin
textures, can be distinguished from the momentum-transfer dependence of the
spin-flip signal. The data cannot be described by the well-known and often-used
analytical expressions for uniformly magnetized spherical or core-shell
particles, in particular at remanence or at the coercive field. Based on a
second-order polynomial expansion for the magnetization vector field, we
develop a novel minimal model for the azimuthally-averaged magnetic SANS cross
section. The theoretical expression considers a general magnetization
inhomogeneity and is not restricted to the presence of surface anisotropy. It
is shown that the model describes very well our simulation data as well as more
complex spin patterns such as vortex-like structures. Only seven expansion
coefficients and some basis functions are sufficient to describe the scattering
behavior of a very large number of atomic spins.

<h3>Propulsion of a chiral microswimmer in viscoelastic fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05718</a>
<br>
<i>Takuya Kobayashi, John J. Molina, Ryoichi Yamamoto</i>
<p>Microswimmers often use chirality to generate translational movement from
rotational motion. We study the swimming velocity of a spherical chiral
microswimmer and find that the self-propulsion velocity increases quadratically
with the degree of chirality in viscoelastic fluids. We show that this speed
enhancement is caused by the normal stress differences that are generated by
the rotational flows around the microswimmer, which lead to a Weissenberg
effect. Furthermore, the normal stress difference is swimmer-specific, i.e., it
will depend on whether the swimmer is a pusher or a puller.

<h3>Mott Transition and Volume Law Entanglement with Neural Quantum States</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05749" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05749</a>
<br>
<i>Chlo√© Gauvin-Ndiaye, Joseph Tindall, Javier Robledo Moreno, Antoine Georges</i>
<p>The interplay between delocalisation and repulsive interactions can cause
electronic systems to undergo a Mott transition between a metal and an
insulator. Here we use neural network hidden fermion determinantal states
(HFDS) to uncover this transition in the disordered, fully-connected Hubbard
model. Whilst dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides exact solutions to
physical observables of the model in the thermodynamic limit, our method allows
us to directly access the wavefunction for finite system sizes well beyond the
reach of exact diagonalisation. We directly benchmark our results against
state-of-the-art calculations obtained using a Matrix Product State (MPS)
ansatz. We demonstrate how HFDS is able to obtain more accurate results in the
metallic regime and in the vicinity of the transition, with the volume law of
entanglement exhibited by the system being prohibitive to the MPS ansatz. We
use the HFDS method to calculate the amplitudes of the wavefunction, the energy
and double occupancy, the quasi-particle weight and the energy gap, hence
providing novel insights into this model and the nature of the transition. Our
work paves the way for the study of strongly correlated electron systems with
neural quantum states.

<h3>Single-Atom Control of Arsenic Incorporation in Silicon for High-Yield  Artificial Lattice Fabrication</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05752</a>
<br>
<i>Taylor J. Z. Stock, Oliver Warschkow, Procopios C. Constantinou, David R. Bowler, Steven R. Schofield, Neil J. Curson</i>
<p>Artificial lattices constructed from individual dopant atoms within a
semiconductor crystal hold promise to provide novel materials with tailored
electronic, magnetic, and optical properties. These custom engineered lattices
are anticipated to enable new, fundamental discoveries in condensed matter
physics and lead to the creation of new semiconductor technologies including
analog quantum simulators and universal solid-state quantum computers. In this
work, we report precise and repeatable, substitutional incorporation of single
arsenic atoms into a silicon lattice. We employ a combination of scanning
tunnelling microscopy hydrogen resist lithography and a detailed statistical
exploration of the chemistry of arsine on the hydrogen terminated silicon (001)
surface, to show that single arsenic dopants can be deterministically placed
within four silicon lattice sites and incorporated with 97$\pm$2% yield. These
findings bring us closer to the ultimate frontier in semiconductor technology:
the deterministic assembly of atomically precise dopant and qubit arrays at
arbitrarily large scales.

<h3>Brillouin light scattering studies of aqueous E. coli cell lysate:  Viscoelastic properties of a multimacromolecular solution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05761" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05761</a>
<br>
<i>D. F. Hanlon, S. Heravi, V. Booth, G. T. Andrews</i>
<p>Brillouin spectroscopy was used to probe the viscoelastic properties of E.
coli bacterial cell lysate in aqueous solution at GHz-frequencies over the
range -5.0 $^\circ$C $\leq T \leq$ 50.0 $^\circ$C. This work offers a first
temperature dependent study on cell lysate by Brillouin light scattering. A
single peak was observed in the spectra and attributed to a longitudinal
acoustic mode of the solution. The speed of sound, bulk modulus, apparent
viscosity and hypersound attenuation were extracted from the frequency shift
and FWHM of the spectral peak. This study demonstrate that the behavior of
complex multimacromolecular solutions, as shown by \textit{E. coli} lysate, can
exhibit viscoelastic properties closely akin to those observed in simple binary
aqueous protein solutions. Furthermore, our findings show that by analyzing the
raw spectral signature of the Brillouin spectra, it may be possible to identify
protein denaturation.

<i>Imad Limame, Ching-Wen Shih, Alexej Koltchanov, Fabian Heisinger, Felix Nippert, Moritz Plattner, Johannes Schall, Markus R. Wagner, Sven Rodt, Petr Klenovsky, Stephan Reitzenstein</i>
<p>We report on the epitaxial growth, theoretical modeling, and structural as
well as optical investigation of multi-layer, site-controlled quantum dots
fabricated using the buried stressor method. This advanced growth technique
utilizes the strain from a partially oxidized AlAs layer to induce
site-selective nucleation of InGaAs quantum dots. By implementing
strain-induced spectral nano-engineering, we achieve separation in emission
energy by about 150 meV of positioned and non-positioned quantum dots and a
local increase of the emitter density in a single layer. Furthermore, we
achieve a threefold increase of the optical intensity and reduce the
inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble emission by 20% via stacking three
layers of site-controlled emitters, which is particularly valuable for using
the SCQDs in microlaser applications. Moreover, we obtain direct control over
emission properties by adjusting the growth and fabrication parameters. Our
optimization of site-controlled growth of quantum dots enables the development
of photonic devices with enhanced light-matter interaction and microlasers with
increased confinement factor and spontaneous emission coupling efficiency.

<h3>Entropy Production on Cooperative Opinion Dynamics</h3>

<p>As one of the most widespread social dynamics, cooperative behavior is among
the most fascinating collective phenomena. Several animal species, from social
insects to human beings, feature social groups altruistically working for a
common benefit. This collaborative conduct pervades the actions and opinions of
individuals, yielding strategic decision-making between political, religious,
ethnic, and economic social puzzles. Here, we explore how cooperative behavior
phenomena impact collective opinion dynamics and entropy generation in social
groups. We select a random fraction $f$ of community members as collaborative
individuals and model the opinion dynamics using a social temperature parameter
$q$ that functions as a social anxiety noise. With probability $q$, regular
individuals oppose their companions about a social decision, assuming group
dissent. Collaborative agents experience a reduced effective social noise $\mu
q$, where $0 < \mu < 1$ is the social anxiety noise sensibility parameter that
enhances social validation. We perform numerical simulations and mean-field
analysis and find the system undergoes nonequilibrium order-disorder phase
transitions with expressive social entropy production. Our results also
highlight the effects of an individual social anxiety attenuation level in
enhancing group consensus and inducing exuberant collective phenomena in
complex systems.

<h3>Majorana corner modes and tunable patterns in an altermagnet  heterostructure</h3>

<i>Yu-Xuan Li, Cheng-Cheng Liu</i>
<p>The mutual competition and synergy of magnetism and superconductivity provide
us with a very valuable opportunity to access topological superconductivity and
Majorana Fermions. Here, we devise a heterostructure consisting of an $s$-wave
superconductor, a 2D topological insulator and an altermagnet, which is
classified as the third magnet and featured by zero magnetization but spin
polarization in both real and reciprocal spaces. We find that the altermagnet
can induce mass terms at the edges that compete with electron pairing, and mass
domains are formed at the corners of sample, resulting in zero-energy Majorana
corner modes (MCMs). The presence or absence of MCMs can be engineered by only
changing the direction of the N\'{e}el vector. Moreover, uniaxial strain can
effectively manipulate the patterns of the MCMs, such as moving and
interchanging MCMs. Experimental realization, remarkable advantages of our
proposal and possible braiding are discussed.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnets exhibit unique physical properties for potential
applications in spintronics. To date, most 2D ferromagnets are obtained by
mechanical exfoliation of bulk materials with van der Waals interlayer
interactions, and the synthesis of single or few-layer 2D ferromagnets with
strong interlayer coupling remains experimentally challenging. Here, we report
the epitaxial growth of 2D non-van der Waals ferromagnetic bilayer FeSb on
SrTiO3(001) substrates stabilized by strong coupling to the substrate, which
exhibits in-plane magnetic anisotropy and a Curie temperature above 300 K.
In-situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and
density-functional theory calculations further reveal that a Fe Kagome layer
terminates the bilayer FeSb. Our results open a new avenue for further
exploring emergent quantum phenomena from the interplay of ferromagnetism and
topology for application in spintronics.

<p>Kagome lattice hosts a plethora of quantum states arising from the interplay
of topology, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlations. Here, we report
symmetry-breaking electronic orders tunable by an applied magnetic field in a
model Kagome magnet FeSn consisting of alternating stacks of two-dimensional
Fe3Sn Kagome and Sn2 honeycomb layers. On the Fe3Sn layer terminated FeSn thin
films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(111) substrates, we observe trimerization of
the Kagome lattice using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, breaking
its six-fold rotational symmetry while preserving the transitional symmetry.
Such a trimerized Kagome lattice shows an energy-dependent contrast reversal in
dI/dV maps, which is significantly enhanced by bound states induced by Sn
vacancy defects. This trimerized Kagome lattice also exhibits stripe
modulations that are energy-dependent and tunable by an applied in-plane
magnetic field, indicating symmetry-breaking nematicity from the entangled
magnetic and charge degrees of freedom in antiferromagnet FeSn.

<i>Shiho Nakamura, Nobuyuki Umetsu, Michael Quinsat, Masaki Kado</i>
<p>The exchange stiffness of magnetic materials is one of the essential
parameters governing magnetic texture and its dynamics in magnetic devices. The
effect of single-element doping on exchange stiffness has been investigated for
several doping elements for permalloy (NiFe alloy), a soft magnetic material
whose soft magnetic properties can be controlled by doping. However, the impact
of more practical multi-element doping on the exchange stiffness of permalloy
is unknown. This study investigates the typical magnetic properties, including
exchange stiffness, of permalloy systematically co-doped with Mo and Cu using
broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. We find that the exchange
stiffness, which decreases with increasing doping levels, is proportional to a
power of magnetization, which also decreases with increasing doping levels. The
magnetization dependence of the exchange stiffness of all the investigated
samples, irrespective of the doping levels of each element, lies on a single
curve expressed as $A\propto M_{\rm s}^n$ with exponent $n$ close to 2. This
empirical power-law relationship provides a guideline for predicting unknown
exchange stiffness in non-magnetic element-doped systems.

<h3>Sol-gel synthesis and multiferroic properties of pyrochlore-free  Pb(Fe0.5Nb0.5)O3 thin films</h3>

<br>
<i>L. Imhoff, M. B. Di Marco, S. Barolin, M. A. Rengifo, M.H. Aguirre, M.G. Stachiotti</i>
<p>Lead iron niobate (PbFe0.5Nb0.5O3 - PFN) thin films were synthesized by a
modified sol-gel route, which offers the advantage of a rapid, simple and
non-toxic reaction method. Polycrystalline perovskite-structured PFN thin films
without pyrochlore phases were obtained on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates after
sintering by rapid thermal annealing at 650 {\deg}C. TEM and AFM images
confirmed the excellent quality of the sintered film, while EDS spectroscopy
revealed the presence of oxygen vacancies near the film/substrate interface.
Electric measurements show good dielectric properties and ferroelectric
behavior, characterized by typical C-V curves and well-defined P-E
ferroelectric loops at 1 kHz, with remanent polarization values of ~12 uC/cm2.
The polarization, however, increases with decreasing frequency, indicating the
presence of leakage currents. I-V measurements show a significant increase in
DC-conduction at relatively low fields (around 100 kV/cm). The films display
ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature, with magnetic remanence around 30
emu/cm3 and a coercive field of 1 kOe. These values are significantly higher
than those obtained for PFN powders fabricated by the same sol-gel route, as
well as the magnetization values reported in the literature for epitaxial
films.

<h3>Enhancement of optical absorption in multiferroic (1-x)PZT-xPFN thin  films: Experiments and first-principles analysis</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05855</a>
<br>
<i>L. Imhoff, M. B. Di Marco, C. Lavado, S. Barolin, M. G. Stachiotti</i>
<p>Multiferroic compounds have gained research attention in the field of
ferroelectric photovoltaics due to the presence of transition-metal d states
from magnetic ions, which tend to reduce the bandgap value. In this work,
0.5Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 - 0.5Pb(Fe0.5Nb0.5)O3 PZTFN0.5 thin films were
synthesized using a sol-gel route to investigate the effect of iron doping on
optical and multiferroic properties. For comparative analysis, the end-member
compositions, Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) and Pb(Fe0.5Nb0.5)O3 (PFN), were also
synthesized under identical conditions. Our results revealed that the presence
of Fe ions, besides inducing multiferroic behavior, effectively enhances the
optical absorption of the material in the visible light region. Optical
transitions at 3.0 eV (2.4 eV) and 2.7 eV (2.2 eV) for the direct (indirect)
bandgap were determined for PZTFN0.5 and PFN, respectively, indicating that the
absorption edges of the iron-containing films result more promising than PZT
(Eg 3.6eV) for photovoltaic applications. Both PZTFN0.5 and PFN thin films
exhibit multiferroic behavior at room temperature, with different electric and
magnetic properties. While PZTFN0.5 presents saturated hysteresis loops with
remanent polarization values around 10 uC/cm2 and magnetization of 1.6 emu/cm2,
PFN displays significantly larger remanence (31 emu/cm2) but poorer
ferroelectric properties due to the presence of leakage. Microscopic insights
into the structural and electronic properties of the PZTFN0.5 solid solution
were provided from first-principles calculations.

<p>The Mott system with a low-energy excitation may well constitute the

cuprates. This manuscript explores the above through the Hubbard-1
approximation (the Green function method), especially in terms of its
self-energy while evaluating the calculation of self-energy using effective
mass ratio. Results show it appears the pseudo-gap of HTSC is due to the
self-energy effect on the quasi-particle excitation of the Mott's J.

<i>Zeyang Gong, Fu Liu, Xinhong Guo, Changjun Jiang</i>
<p>The out-of-plane antidamping-like orbital torque fosters great hope for
high-efficiency spintronic devices. Here we report experimentally the
observation of out-of-plane antidamping-like torque that could be generated by
z-polarized orbital current in ferromagnetic-metal/oxidized Cu bilayers, which
is presented unambiguously by the magnetic field angle dependence of
spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance signal. The oxidized Cu thickness
dependence of orbital torque ratios highlights the interfacial effect would be
responsible for the generation of orbital current. Besides that, the oxidized
Cu thickness dependence of damping parameter further proves the observation of
antidamping-like torque. This result contributes to enriching the
orbital-related theory of the generation mechanism of the orbital torque.

<h3>Anisotropy of shear relaxation in primitive chain network simulations  for entangled polymers confined between flat walls</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05886" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05886</a>
<br>
<i>Yuichi Masubuchi</i>
<p>Anisotropic shear relaxation is an interesting but rarely discussed issue in
polymer dynamics under confinement [Abberton et al., Macromolecules, 48, 7631,
2015]. According to the earlier study of bead spring simulations for an
unentangled polymer melt confined between two flat plates, the shear relaxation
modulus taken perpendicular to the interface is accelerated by decreasing the
distance between plates, whereas the parallel component is unchanged. This
study observed similar anisotropic shear relaxation for entangled polymer melts
under confinement in multi-chain slip-link simulations (primitive chain network
simulations). The analysis demonstrated that the accelerated relaxation in the
perpendicular component reflects the Rouse-type constraint release dynamics,
for which the coarsening is upper-limited by the geometry. This result suggests
a novel mechanism for anisotropic shear relaxation different from the modified
chain statistics under confinement considered for unentangled systems.

<h3>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of  real-space renormalization group</h3>

<br>
<i>Xinliang Lyu, Naoki Kawashima</i>
<p>We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate
limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization
group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes.
Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin
method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale
correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the
tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and
is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives
and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D),
however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D
block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show
that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining
more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is
proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.

<h3>Spatial distribution of reduced density of hard spheres near a  hard-sphere dimer: Results from three-dimensional Ornstein-Zernike equations  coupled with several different closures and from grand canonical Monte Carlo  simulation</h3>

<br>
<i>Mika Matsuo, Yuka Nakamura, Masahiro Kinoshita, Ryo Akiyama</i>
<p>We calculated the spatial distribution of reduced density and pair
distribution function (PDF) of solvent hard spheres near a solute using
three-dimensional Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equations coupled with closures in
which Percus-Yevick (PY) and hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximations were
employed or bridge functions (BFs) proposed by Verlet, Duh and Henderson, and
Kinoshita were incorporated. The solute was formed by two solvent hard spheres
in contact with each other, with the result that the system is not
radial-symmetric, necessitating the extension of Verlet, Duh-Henderson, and
Kinoshita BFs to three-variable functions considered in the Cartesian
coordinate system. The results were compared with those from grand canonical
Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. In terms of the PDF, HNC is superior to PY in the
sense that the results from the former are closer to those from MC. The
incorporation of the three BFs makes the results further closer to those from
MC. The three BFs share almost the same performance for a solute immersed in a
one-component solvent at the infinite-dilution limit. Analyses on the triplet
distribution function (TDF) were also performed. It was found that in terms of
the TDF the incorporation of the BFs does not necessarily lead to improvement.

<p>The understanding of prototropic tautomerism in water and the
characterization of solvent effects on protomeric equilibrium pose significant
challenges. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on state-of-the-art deep
learning potential and enhanced sampling methods, we provide a comprehensive
description of all configurational transformations in glycine solvated in water
and determine accurate free energy profiles of these processes. We observe that
the tautomerism between the neutral and zwitterionic forms of solvated glycine
can occur by both intramolecular proton transfer in glycine and intermolecular
proton transfer in the contact ion pair (anionic glycine and hydronium ion) or
the separated ion pair (cationic glycine and hydroxide ion).

<p>The recent discovery of the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome superconductors
launched a growing field of research investigating electronic instabilities in
kagome metals. Specifically, the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family naturally exhibits a Fermi
level tuned to the Van Hove singularities associated with the saddle points
formed from the prototypical kagome band structure. The charge density wave and
superconducting states that form within the kagome networks of these compounds
exhibit a number of anomalous properties reminiscent of theoretical predictions
of exotic states in kagome metals tuned close to their Van Hove fillings. Here
we provide an overview of the key structural and electronic features of
AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds and review the status of investigations into their
unconventional electronic phase transitions.

<p>We develop a novel simulation procedure for angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photoelectron wave function is set to be an
outgoing plane wave in a vacuum associated with the emitted photoelectron wave
packet. ARPES measurements on the transition metal dichalcogenide
$1T$-$\mathrm{Ti}\mathrm{S}_2$ are performed, and our simulations exhibit good
agreement with experiments. Analysis of our calculated final state wave
functions quantitatively visualizes that they include various waves due to the
boundary condition and the uneven crystal potential. These results show that a
more detailed investigation of the photoelectron final states is necessary to
fully explain the photon-energy- and light-polarization-dependent ARPES
spectra.

<p>We report investigations of the magnetic textures in periodic [Pt(1
nm)/(CoFeB(0.8 nm)/Ru(1.4 nm)]$_{10}$ multilayers using polarised neutron
reflectometry (PNR) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The multilayers
are known to host skyrmions stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
induced by broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling at the asymmetric
interfaces. From depth-dependent PNR measurements, we observe well-defined
structural features, and obtain the layer-resolved magnetization profiles. The
in-plane magnetization of the CoFeB layers calculated from fitting of the PNR
profiles is found to be in excellent agreement with magnetometry data. Using
SANS as a bulk probe of the entire multilayer, we observe long-period magnetic
stripe domains and skyrmion ensembles with full orientational disorder at room
temperature. No sign of skyrmions is found below 250\,K, which we suggest is
due to an increase of a effective magnetic anisotropy in the CoFeB layer on
cooling that suppresses skyrmion stability. Using polarised SANS at room
temperature, we prove the existence of pure N\'eel-type windings in both stripe
domain and skyrmion regimes. No Bloch-type winding admixture, i.e. an
indication for hybrid windings, is detected within the measurement sensitivity,
in good agreement with expectations according to our micromagnetic modelling of
the multilayers. Our findings using neutron techniques offer valuable
microscopic insights into the rich magnetic behavior of skyrmion-hosting
multilayers, which are essential for the advancement of future skyrmion-based
spintronic devices.

<h3>Exciton lasing in carbon nanotubes below the population inversion  threshold via phonon-mediated stimulated emission</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05962" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05962</a>
<br>
<i>Stefano Dal Forno, Marco Battiato</i>
<p>Excitonic optical transitions in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been
extensively studied for at least two decades. However, exploiting these
transitions to produce a lasing effect has been proved unpractical due to the
difficulties of achieving an excitonic population inversion in carbon
nanotubes. In this work we show that lasing is theoretically possible at a much
lower exciton population threshold by taking advantage of phonon stimulated
emission. Specifically, the so-called Anti-Stokes transitions, where light is
generated by the creation of a phonon and the annihilation of an exciton, can
be used to sustain the coherent emission of photons. These transitions have
been overlooked for long due to their low intensity as a consequence of the low
occupancy of the associated phonon branches. We show that the best conditions
to achieve the lasing effect are met in CNTs with i) excitons of non-zero
momentum, ii) a strong exciton-phonon coupling and iii) narrow exciton
transitions.

<i>Piotr T. Grochowski, Martin-Isbj√∂rn Trappe, Tomasz Karpiuk, Kazimierz RzƒÖ≈ºewski</i>
<p>We present a theoretical analysis of phase separations between two
repulsively interacting components in an ultracold fermionic gas, occurring at
the dimensional crossover in a harmonic trap with varying aspect ratios. A
tailored kinetic energy functional is derived and combined with a
density-potential functional approach to develop a framework that is
benchmarked with the orbital-based method. We investigate the changes in the
density profile of the phase-separated gas under different interaction
strengths and geometries. The analysis reveals the existence of small,
partially polarized domains in certain parameter regimes, which is similar to
the purely two-dimensional limit. However, the density profile is further
enriched by a shell structure found in anisotropic traps. We also track the
transitions that can be driven by either a change in interaction strength or
trap geometry. The developed framework is noted to have applications for other
systems with repulsive interactions that combine continuous and discrete
degrees of freedom.

<p>Model Hamiltonians are regularly derived from first-principles data to
describe correlated matter. However, the standard methods for this contain a
number of largely unexplored approximations. For a strongly correlated impurity
model system, here we carefully compare standard downfolding techniques with
the best-possible ground-truth estimates for charge-neutral excited state
energies and charge densities using state-of-the-art first-principles many-body
wave function approaches. To this end, we use the vanadocene molecule and
analyze all downfolding aspects, including the Hamiltonian form, target basis,
double counting correction, and Coulomb interaction screening models. We find
that the choice of target-space basis functions emerges as a key factor for the
quality of the downfolded results, while orbital-dependent double counting
correction diminishes the quality. Background screening to the Coulomb
interaction matrix elements primarily affects crystal-field excitations. Our
benchmark uncovers the relative importance of each downfolding step and offers
insights into the potential accuracy of minimal downfolded model Hamiltonians.

<h3>Self-hybridisation between interband transitions and Mie modes in  dielectric nanoparticles</h3>

<br>
<i>Christos Tserkezis, P. Elli Stamatopoulou, Christian Wolff, N. Asger Mortensen</i>
<p>We discuss the possibility of self-hybridisation in high-index dielectric
nanoparticles, where Mie modes of electric or magnetic type can couple to the
interband transitions of the material, leading to spectral anticrossings.
Starting with an idealised system described by moderately high constant
permittivity with a narrow Lorentzian, in which self-hybridisation is visible
for both plane-wave and electron-beam excitation, we embark on a quest for
realistic systems where this effect should be visible. We explore a variety of
spherical particles made of traditional semiconductors such as Si, GaAs, and
GaP. With the effect hardly discernible, we identify two major causes hindering
observation of self-hybridisation: the very broad spectral fingerprints of
interband transitions in most candidate materials, and the significant overlap
between electric and magnetic Mie modes in nanospheres. We thus depart from the
spherical shape, and show that interband--Mie hybridisation is indeed feasible
in the example of GaAs cylinders, even with a simple plane-wave source. This
so-far unreported kind of polariton has to be considered when interpreting
experimental spectra of Mie-resonant nanoparticles and assigning modal
characters to specific features. On the other hand, it has the potential to be
useful for the characterisation of the optical properties of dielectric
materials, through control of the hybridisation strength via nanoparticle size
and shape.

<p>We revisit the problem of two-terminal transport of non-interacting Fermi
particles across the tight-binding chain by employing the semi-microscopic
model for the contacts, where we mimic the self-thermalization property of the
contacts by using the Lindblad relaxation operators. It is argued that the
dissipative dynamics of the contacts can essentially modify the line-shape of
resonant peaks as compared to the Landauer-B\"uttiker theory. We also address
the effect of this dissipative dynamics, which we refer to as external
decoherence, on particle transport in disorder chains. It is shown that
external decoherence reduces conductance fluctuations but does not affect the
Anderson localization length.

<i>Hossein Tahmasbi, Kushal Ramakrishna, Mani Lokamani, Attila Cangi</i>
<p>We created a computational workflow to analyze the potential energy surface
(PES) of materials using machine-learned interatomic potentials in conjunction
with the minima hopping algorithm. We demonstrate this method by producing a
versatile machine-learned interatomic potential for iron hydride via a neural
network using an iterative training process to explore its energy landscape
under different pressures. To evaluate the accuracy and comprehend the
intricacies of the PES, we conducted comprehensive crystal structure
predictions using our neural network-based potential paired with the minima
hopping approach. The predictions spanned pressures ranging from ambient to 100
GPa. Our results reproduce the experimentally verified global minimum
structures such as \textit{dhcp}, \textit{hcp}, and \textit{fcc}, corroborating
previous findings. Furthermore, our in-depth exploration of the iron hydride
PES at different pressures has revealed complex alterations and stacking faults
in these phases, leading to the identification of several new low-enthalpy
structures. This investigation has not only confirmed the presence of regions
of established FeH configurations but has also highlighted the efficacy of
using data-driven, extensive structure prediction methods to uncover the
multifaceted PES of materials.

<p>The intensive development of nanodevices acting as two-state systems has
motivated the search for nanoscale molecular structures whose long-term
conformational dynamics are similar to the dynamics of bistable mechanical
systems such as Euler arches and Duffing oscillators. Collective synchrony in
bistable dynamics of molecular-sized systems has attracted immense attention as
a potential pathway to amplify the output signals of molecular nanodevices.
Recently, pyridin-furan oligomers of helical shape that are a few nanometers in
size and exhibit bistable dynamics similar to a Duffing oscillator have been
identified through molecular dynamics simulations. In this article, we present
the case of dynamical synchronization of these bistable systems. We show that
two pyridine-furan springs connected by a rigid oligomeric bridge spontaneously
synchronize vibrations and stochastic resonance enhances the synchronization
effect.

<p>There is growing interest in molecular structures that exhibit dynamics
similar to bistable mechanical systems. These structures have the potential to
be used as nanodevices with two distinct states. Particularly intriguing are
structures that display spontaneous vibrations and stochastic resonance.
Previously, through molecular dynamics simulations, it was discovered that
short pyridine-furan springs, when subjected to force loading, exhibit the
bistable dynamics of a Duffing oscillator. In this study, we extend these
simulations to include short pyridine-pyrrole and pyridine-furan springs in a
hydrophobic solvent. Our findings demonstrate that these systems also display
the bistable dynamics of a Duffing oscillator, accompanied by spontaneous
vibrations and stochastic resonance activated by thermal noise.

<br>
<i>Yuhang Hou, Hongyi Yu</i>
<p>We examine how the dielectric screening of two-dimensional layered materials
affects the dipolar interaction between interlayer excitons in few-layer van
der Waals structures. Surprisingly, the dipolar interaction is found to be
largely enhanced by two-dimensional dielectric screening at an inter-exciton
separation of several nanometers or larger. The underlying mechanism can be
attributed to the induced-charge densities in layered materials, which give
rise to induced-dipole densities at large distances with directions parallel to
that of the interlayer exciton. The interaction between quadrupolar excitons in
trilayer structures are found to be enhanced even larger, with a magnitude one
to two orders stronger than that without 2D dielectric screening. The strengths
of these dipolar and quadrupolar interactions can be further tuned by
engineering the environmental dielectric constant.

forefront of research in nanoscale physics and, in particular, quantum
plasmonics. In alkali metals, nonlocality manifests predominantly as electron
density spill-out at the metal boundary, and as surface-enabled Landau damping.
For an accurate description of plasmonic modes, these effects need be taken
into account in the theoretical modelling of the material. The resulting modal
frequency shifts and broadening become particularly relevant when dealing with
the strong interaction between plasmons and excitons, where hybrid modes emerge
and the way they are affected can reflect modifications of the coupling
strength. Both nonlocal phenomena can be incorporated in the classical local
theory by applying a surface-response formalism embodied by the Feibelman
parameters. Here, we implement surface-response corrections in Mie theory to
study the optical response of spherical plasmonic--excitonic composites in
core--shell configurations. We investigate sodium, a jellium metal dominated by
spill-out, for which it has been anticipated that nonlocal corrections should
lead to an observable change in the coupling strength, appearing as a
modification of the width of the mode splitting. We show that, contrary to
expectations, the influence of nonlocality on the anticrossing is minimal, thus
validating the accuracy of the local response approximation in strong-coupling
photonics.

<p>The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on an anisotropic triangular lattice
(ATL) is an archetypal spin system hosting exotic quantum magnetism and
dimensional crossover. However, the progress in experimental research on this
field has been limited due to the scarcity of ideal model materials. Here, we
show that rhenium oxyhalides $A_{3}$ReO$_{5}X_{2}$, where spin-1/2 Re$^{6+}$
ions form a layered structure of ATLs, allow for flexible chemical substitution
in both cation $A^{2+}$ ($A$ = Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb) and anion $X^{-}$ ($X$ = Cl, Br)
sites, leading to seven synthesizable compounds. By combining magnetic
susceptibility and high-field magnetization measurements with theoretical
calculations using the orthogonalized finite-temperature Lanczos method, we
find that the anisotropy $J'/J$ ranges from 0.25 to 0.45 depending on the
chemical composition. Our findings demonstrate that $A_{3}$ReO$_{5}X_{2}$ is an
excellent platform for realizing diverse effective spin Hamiltonians that
differ in the strength of the anisotropy $J'/J$ as well as the relevance of
perturbation terms such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and interlayer
exchange coupling.

<h3>Revisiting the metal-to-metal transition in $2H$-AgNiO$_2$</h3>

<i>Jannik Gondolf, Ilya Eremin, Frank Lechermann</i>
<p>The layered delafossite compound AgNiO$_2$ with $2H$ stacking symmetry
undergoes a structural metal-to-metal transition at $T_{\rm S}\sim 365$ K. It
has been described in the past as a charge-ordering transition, where local
$S=1$ spins are formed on part of the Ni sites. By means of first-principles
many body calculations, we show that the transition is in fact a site-selective
Mott transition on the Ni sublattice with only minor charge differentiation.
Key to this finding is the uncovering of ligand-hole physics, rendering a
Ni$^{2+}$ instead of a formal Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation state, in conjunction with
strong local Coulomb repulsions.

<p>Transition metal oxides with a wide variety of electronic and magnetic
properties offer an extraordinary possibility to be a platform for developing
future electronics based on unconventional quantum phenomena, for instance, the
topology. The formation of topologically non-trivial states is related to
crystalline symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic ordering. Here, we
demonstrate how lattice distortions and octahedral rotation in SrNbO$_3$ films
induce the band topology. By employing angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we
verify the presence of in-phase $a^0a^0c^+$ octahedral rotation in ultra-thin
SrNbO$_3$ films, which causes the formation of topologically-protected Dirac
band crossings. Our study illustrates that octahedral engineering can be
effectively exploited for implanting and controlling quantum topological phases
in transition metal oxides.

<h3>Strong-coupling superconductivity of the Heusler-type compound ScAu2Al:  Ab-initio studies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06075" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06075</a>
<br>
<i>Gabriel Kuderowicz, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</i>
<p>The ScAu$_2$Al superconducting Heusler-type compound was recently
characterized to have the highest critical temperature of $T_c = 5.12$ K and
the strongest electron-phonon coupling among the Heusler family. In this work,
the electronic structure, phonons, electron-phonon coupling, and
superconductivity of ScAu$_2$Al are studied using \textit{ab initio}
calculations. The spin-orbit coupling significantly changes the electronic
structure removing the van Hove singularity from the vicinity of the Fermi
level. In the phonon spectrum, low frequency acoustic modes, additionally
softened by the spin-orbit interaction, strongly couple with electrons, leading
to the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda=1.25$, a record high among
Heuslers. The density functional theory for superconductors is then used to
analyze superconducting {state in this two-band superconductor}. The effect of
spin fluctuations (SF) on superconductivity is also analyzed. The calculated
critical temperatures of $T_c = 5.16$ K (4.79 K with SF) agree very well with
the experiment, confirming the electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity
and showing a weak spin-fluctuations effect. The superconducting gaps formed on
two Fermi surface sheets exhibit moderate anisotropy. Their magnitudes confirm
the strong coupling regime, as the reduced average values are $2\Delta_1/k_BT_c
\simeq 4.1$ and $2\Delta_2/k_BT_c \simeq 4.3$. Anisotropy of the gaps and large
spread in their values significantly affect the calculated quasiparticle
density of states.

<p>We report on first observation of spin noise in a strongly birefringent
semiconductor -- halide perovskite single crystal MAPbI$_3$. The observed spin
noise resonance is ascribed to free holes with a record spin dephasing time of
4 ns. The spin dynamics is found to be affected by the residual light
absorption of the crystal providing renormalization of the Larmor frequency.
Extended spin noise spectroscopy with rotating magnetic field allowed us not
only to evaluate the $g$-factor anisotropy, but also to distinguish two
different spin subsystems tentatively associated to twinning of the crystal.

<h3>Thermodynamic transitions and topology of spin-triplet  superconductivity: Application to UTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Henrik S. R√∏ising, Max Geier, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen</i>
<p>The discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the heavy-fermion
material UTe$_2$ has reinvigorated research of spin-triplet superconductivity.
We perform a theoretical study of coupled two-component spin-triplet
superconducting order parameters and their thermodynamic transitions into the
superconducting state. With focus on the behavior of the temperature dependence
of the specific heat capacity, we find that two-component time-reversal
symmetry breaking superconducting order may feature vanishing or even negative
secondary specific heat anomalies. The origin of this unusual specific heat
behavior is tied to the non-unitarity of the composite order parameter.
Additionally, we supply an analysis of the topological surface states
associated with the different possible spin-triplet orders: single-component
orders host Dirac Majorana surface states in addition to possible bulk nodes. A
second component breaking time-reversal symmetry gaps these surfaces states
producing chiral Majorana hinge modes. DFT+$U$ band-structure calculations
support that these topological phases are realized in UTe$_2$ when introducing
weak superconducting pairing. Our topological analysis suggests measurable
signatures for surface-probe experiments to acquire further evidence of the
superconducting pairing symmetry.

<h3>Resolution of similar patterns in a solvable model of unsupervised deep  learning with structured data</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrea Baroffio, Pietro Rotondo, Marco Gherardi</i>
<p>Empirical data, on which deep learning relies, has substantial internal
structure, yet prevailing theories often disregard this aspect. Recent research
has led to the definition of structured data ensembles, aimed at equipping
established theoretical frameworks with interpretable structural elements, a
pursuit that aligns with the broader objectives of spin glass theory. We
consider a one-parameter structured ensemble where data consists of correlated
pairs of patterns, and a simplified model of unsupervised learning, whereby the
internal representation of the training set is fixed at each layer. A mean
field solution of the model identifies a set of layer-wise recurrence equations
for the overlaps between the internal representations of an unseen input and of
the training set. The bifurcation diagram of this discrete-time dynamics is
topologically inequivalent to the unstructured one, and displays transitions
between different phases, selected by varying the load (the number of training
pairs divided by the width of the network). The network's ability to resolve
different patterns undergoes a discontinuous transition to a phase where signal
processing along the layers dissipates differential information about an
input's proximity to the different patterns in a pair. A critical value of the
parameter tuning the correlations separates regimes where data structure
improves or hampers the identification of a given pair of patterns.

<h3>Breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in solid hydrogen and  hydrogen-rich solids</h3>

<br>
<i>Ville J. H√§rk√∂nen</i>
<p>Hydrogen has been the subject of intense research following the discovery of
high-temperature superconductivity in hydrides, and as a result of continuous
efforts to produce solid hydrogen. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is the
central piece of the quantum mechanical description of molecules and solids and
it is expected to have its weakest validity in hydrogen containing matter as it
is the lightest element of all. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is almost
always assumed in the description of solids. Some beyond Born-Oppenheimer
effects are likely included in the state-of-art method used to describe
hydrogen-rich materials, but the effects on the electronic structure in solids
have not been considered before. Here we compute the beyond Born-Oppenheimer
corrections to electron density and report a breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation in experimentally known hydride superconductor YH6 and in Cs-IV
structure of solid hydrogen. In both of these materials, we find a significant
transfer of electron density from the volumes surrounding the expected
positions of the hydrogen nuclei to volumes in between the nuclei. We expect
these results to be the starting point of the beyond Born-Oppenheimer studies
of electronic structure in solids, which is likely necessary to understand
these forms of hydrogen-containing materials, also having significant
technological importance.

<h3>Converse Flexoelectricity of Low-Dimensional Bismuth Selenite (Bi2Se3)  Revealed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM)</h3>

<br>
<i>Qiong Liu, S.S. Nanthakumar, Bin Li, Teresa Cheng, Florian Bittner, Chenxi Ma, Fei Ding, Lei Zheng, Bernhard Roth, Xiaoying Zhuang</i>
<p>Many kinds of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) have been demonstrated
to exhibit electromechanical coupling effects, which makes them promising
candidates for next-generation devices, such as piezotronics and
nanogenerators. Recently, flexoelectricity was found to account for the
out-of-plane electromechanical coupling in many 2D transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) who only exhibit in-plane piezoelectricity. However, low
dimensional vdW three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) have been
overlooked regarding their electromechanical properties. In this study, for the
first time, we experimentally investigate the electromechanical coupling of low
dimensional 3D TIs with a centrosymmetric crystal structure, where a binary
compound, bismuth selenite (Bi2Se3), is taken as an example. The results of
piezoresponse force microscope (PFM) tests on the Bi2Se3 nanoflakes show that
the material exhibits both out-of-plane and in-plane electromechanical
responses. The Bi2Se3 nanoflake with a thickness of 37 nm possesses an
effective out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficient of ~0.65 pm V-1. With careful
analyses, the electromechanical responses are verified to arise from the
converse flexoelectricity. The measured effective out-of-plane piezoelectric
coefficient is mainly contributed by flexoelectric coefficient, {\mu}_39, which
is estimated to be approximately 0.13 nC m-1. However, it is rather difficult
to obtain the in-plane component of the flexoelectric tensor from the in-plane
PFM measurements since the direction of the in-plane stress is always not
normal to the AFM cantilever axis. The results provide useful guidance for
understanding the flexoelectric effect of low dimensional vdW materials with
centrosymmetric crystal structures. Moreover, the work can pave to way to
explore the electromechanical devices based on the flexoelectricity of vdW TIs.

<p>Pr-containing perovskite cobaltites exhibit unusual valence transitions,
coupled to coincident structural, spin-state, and metal-insulator transitions.
Heteroepitaxial strain was recently used to control these phenomena in the
model (Pr$_{1-y}$Y$_y$)$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$CoO$_{3-\delta}$ system, stabilizing a
nonmagnetic insulating phase under compression (with a room-temperature
valence/spin-state/metal-insulator transition) and a ferromagnetic metallic
phase under tension, thus exposing a potential spin-state quantum critical
point. The latter has been proposed in cobaltites and can be probed in this
system as a function of a disorder-free variable (strain). We study this here
via thickness-dependent strain relaxation in compressive
SrLaAlO$_4$(001)/(Pr$_{0.85}$Y$_{0.15}$)$_{0.70}$Ca$_{0.30}$CoO$_{3-\delta}$
epitaxial thin films to quasi-continuously probe structural, electronic, and
magnetic behaviors across the nonmagnetic-insulator/ferromagnetic-metal
boundary. High-resolution X-ray diffraction, electronic transport,
magnetometry, polarized neutron reflectometry, and temperature-dependent
magnetic force microscopy provide a detailed picture, including abundant
evidence of temperature- and strain-dependent phase coexistence. This indicates
a first-order phase transition as opposed to spin-state quantum-critical
behavior, which we discuss theoretically via a phenomenological Landau model
for coupled spin-state and magnetic phase transitions.

<h3>Thermoelectric transport properties of electron doped pyrite FeS2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06135" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06135</a>
<br>
<i>Anustup Mukherjee, Alaska Subedi</i>
<p>Pyrite FeS$_2$ has been investigated for a wide range of applications,
including thermoelectrics due to previous observation of large thermopower at
room-temperature. However, the values of thermopower reported in the literature
is extremely sensitive to the nature of sample -- whether they are natural or
lab grown, bulk crystals or thin films -- and an ambiguity in the magnitude and
sign of thermopower of pure FeS$_2$ exists. Variation in the magnitude of
room-temperature thermopower has also been observed in Co-doped samples.
Therefore, it is of interest to clarify the intrinsic thermopower of this
system that could be measured in more pure samples. In this paper, we
investigate the thermoelectric properties of Co-doped FeS$_2$ using first
principles calculations. We apply three different doping schemes to understand
the effect of electron doping in FeS$_2$, namely explicit Co-substitution,
jellium doping and electron addition within rigid band approximation (RBA)
picture. The calculated thermopower is less than $-50$ $\mu$V/K for all values
of Co doping that we studied, suggesting that this system may not be useful in
thermoelectric applications. Interestingly, we find that RBA substantially
overestimates the magnitude of calculated thermopower compared to the explicit
Co-substitution and jellium doping schemes. The overestimation occurs because
the changes in the electronic structure due to doping-induced structural
modification and charge screening is not taken into account by the rigid shift
of the Fermi level within RBA. RBA is frequently used in first principles
investigations of the thermopower of doped semiconductors, and Co-substituted
FeS$_2$ illustrates a case where it fails.

<h3>Atomistic origins of asymmetric charge-discharge kinetics in  off-stoichiometric LiNiO$_2$</h3>

<br>
<i>Penghao Xiao, Ning Zhang, Harold Smith Perez, Minjoon Park</i>
<p>LiNiO$_2$ shows poor Li transport kinetics at the ends of charge and
discharge in the first cycle, which significantly reduces its available
capacity in practice. The atomistic origins of these kinetic limits have not
been fully understood. Here, we examine Li transport in LiNiO$_2$ by
first-principles-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations where both long time
scale and large length scale are achieved, enabling direct comparison with
experiments. Our results reveal the rate-limiting steps at both ends of the
voltage scan and distinguish the differences between charge and discharge at
the same Li content. The asymmetric effects of excess Ni in the Li layer
(Ni$_\textrm{Li}$) are also captured in our unified modelling framework. In the
low voltage region, the first cycle capacity loss due to high overpotential at
the end of discharge is reproduced without empirical input. While the Li
concentration gradient is found responsible for the low overpotential during
charge at this state of charge. Ni$_\textrm{Li}$ increases the overpotential of
discharge but not charge because it only impedes Li diffusion in a particular
range of Li concentration and does not change the equilibrium voltage profile.
The trends from varying the amount of Ni$_\textrm{Li}$ and temperature agree
with experiments. In the high voltage region, charge becomes the slower
process. The bottleneck becomes moving a Li from the Li-rich phase (H2) into
the Li-poor phase (H3), while the Li hopping barriers in both phases are
relatively low. The roles of preexisting nucleation sites and Ni$_\textrm{Li}$
are discussed. These results provide new atomistic insights of the kinetic
hindrances, paving the road to unleash the full potential of high-Ni layered
oxide cathodes.

<i>A. Dana, L. Mu, S. Gelin, S. B. Sinnott, I. Dabo</i>
<p>Cluster expansions are effective and accurate representations of the
potential energy landscape of multicomponent crystalline solids.
Notwithstanding advances in cluster expansion implementations, it remains
computationally demanding to construct expansions for nonperiodic systems,
systems of low dimension, or systems a large number of components (e.g.,
clusters, interfaces, and quinaries). We address these challenges by employing
transfer learning to accelerate the computationally demanding step of
first-principles data generation. This approach exploits Bayesian inference to
incorporate prior knowledge from physics-based or machine-learning empirical
potentials, enabling one to identify the most informative configurations within
a dataset. The efficacy of the method is tested on face-centered cubic Pt:Ni
binaries, yielding a two- to three-fold reduction in the number of
first-principles calculations, while ensuring robust convergence of the
energies with low statistical fluctuations.

<p>Spin wave nonreciprocity in domain walls (DWs) allows for unidirectional
signal processing in reconfigurable magnonic circuits. Using scanning
transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM), we examined coherently-excited magnons
propagating in Bloch-like DWs in amorphous Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Near 1 GHz we detected magnons with short
wavelengths down to $\lambda = 281$ nm in DWs whose minimum width amounted to
$\delta_{\rm DW} = 52$ nm. Consistent with micromagnetic simulations, the STXM
data reveal their nonreciprocal magnon band structures. We identified Bloch
points which disrupted the phase evolution of magnons and induced different
$\lambda$ adjacent to the topological defects. Our observations provide direct
evidence of nonreciprocal spin waves within Bloch-like DWs, serving as
programmable waveguides in magnonic devices with directed information flow.

<i>Simone Di Cataldo, Paul Worm, Jan Tomczak, Liang Si, Karsten Held</i>
<p>High-temperature unconventional superconductivity quite generically emerges
from doping a strongly correlated parent compound, often (close to) an
antiferromagnetic insulator. The recently developed dynamical vertex
approximation is a state-of-the-art technique that has quantitatively predicted
the superconducting dome of nickelates. Here, we apply it to study the effect
of pressure in the infinite-layer nickelate Sr$_x$Pr$_ {1-x}$NiO$_2$. We
reproduce the increase of the critical temperature ($T_c$) under pressure found
in experiment up to 12 GPa. According to our results, $T_c$ can be further
increased with higher pressures. Even without Sr-doping the parent compound,
PrNiO$_2$, will become a high-temperature superconductor thanks to a strongly
enhanced self-doping of the \nidxsqysq{} orbital under pressure. With a maximal
\Tc{} of 100\,K around 100\,GPa, nickelate superconductors can reach that of
the best cuprates.

<h3>Relaxation Critical Dynamics with Emergent Symmetry</h3>

<br>
<i>Yu-Rong Shu, Shuai Yin</i>
<p>Different from usual critical point characterized by a single length scale,
critical point with emergent symmetry exhibits intriguing critical properties
characterized by two relevant length scales, attracting long-term
investigations from both theoretical and experimental aspects. A natural
question is how the critical dynamics is affected by the presence of two
relevant length scales. Here we study the relaxation critical dynamics in the
three-dimensional ($3$D) clock model, whose critical point has emergent $U(1)$
symmetry. We find that in contrast to the magnatization $M$, whose relaxation
process is described by the usual dynamic exponent $z$ of the $3$D $XY$
universality class, the angular order parameter $\phi_q$ shows a two-stage
evolution characterized by different dynamic critical exponents. While in the
short-time stage the relaxation dynamics is governed by $z$, in the long-time
stage the dynamics is controlled by a new dynamic exponent $z'$. We also show
the off-critical-point effects in the critical relaxation. Our results may be
experimentally detected in the hexagonal RMnO$_3$ (R$=$rare earth) materials.

<h3>Magnetotransport properties of a twisted bilayer graphene in the  presence of external electric and magnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06215" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06215</a>
<br>
<i>Priyanka Sinha, Ayan Mondal, Sim√£o Meneses Jo√£o, Bheema Lingam Chittari</i>
<p>We extensively investigate the electronic and transport properties of a
twisted bilayer graphene when subjected to both an external perpendicular
electric field and a magnetic field. Using a basic tight-binding model, we show
the flat electronic band properties as well as the density of states (DOS),
both without and with the applied electric field. In the presence of an
electric field, the degeneracy at the Dirac points is lifted where the
non-monotonic behavior of the energy gap exists, especially for twist angles
below 3$^\circ$. We also study the behavior of the Landau levels (LL) spectra
for different twist angles within a very low energy range. These LL spectra get
modified under the influence of the external electric field. Moreover, we
calculate the dc Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{xy}$) for a very large system
using the Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM). Interestingly, $\sigma_{xy}$ makes a
transition from a half-integer to an integer quantum Hall effect, \textit{i.e.}
the value of $\sigma_{xy}$ shifts from $\pm 4(n+1/2) (2e^2/h)$ ($n$ is an
integer) to $\pm 2n (2e^2/h)$ around a small twist angle of
$\theta=2.005^\circ$. At this angle, $\sigma_{xy}$ acquires a Hall plateau at
zero Fermi energy. However, the behavior of $\sigma_{xy}$ remains unaltered
when the system is exposed to the electric field, particularly at the magic
angle where the bands in both layers can hybridize and strong interlayer
coupling plays a crucial role.

<h3>Topological and magnetic phase transitions in the bilayer Kitaev-Ising  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06245</a>
<br>
<i>Aayush Vijayvargia, Urban F. P. Seifert, Onur Erten</i>
<p>We investigate the phase diagram of a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model with
Ising interlayer interactions, deriving effective models via perturbation
theory and performing Majorana mean-field theory calculations. We show that a
diverse array of magnetic and topological phase transitions occur, depending on
the direction of the interlayer Ising interaction and the relative sign of
Kitaev interactions. When two layers have the same sign of the Kitaev
interaction, a first-order transition from a Kitaev spin liquid to a
magnetically ordered state takes place. The magnetic order points along the
Ising axis and it is (anti)ferromagnetic for (anti)ferromagnetic Kitaev
interactions. However, when two layers have opposite sign of the Kitaev
interaction, we observe a notable weakening of magnetic ordering tendencies and
the Kitaev spin liquid survives up to a remarkably larger interlayer exchange.
Our mean-field analysis suggests the emergence of an intermediate gapped
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid state, which eventually becomes unstable upon vison
condensation. The confined phase is described by a highly frustrated
$120^\circ$ compass model. We furthermore use perturbation theory to study the
model with the Ising axis pointing along $\hat{z}$-axis or lying in the
$xy$-plane. In both cases, our analysis reveals the formation of 1D Ising
chains, which remain decoupled in perturbation theory, resulting in a
subextensive ground-state degeneracy. Our results highlight the interplay
between topological order and magnetic ordering tendencies in bilayer quantum
spin liquids.
