<h3>Fractional Josephson effect versus fractional charge in superconducting-normal metal hybrid circuits</h3>

Fractionally charged excitations play a central role in condensed matter
physics, and can be probed in different ways. If transport occurs via
dissipation-less supercurrents, they manifest as a fractional Josephson effect,
whereas in dissipative transport they can be revealed by the transport
statistics. However, in a regime where supercurrents and lossy currents
coincide, a full understanding of the relationship between these two transport
phenomena is still missing. Here, we unify them by means of topological phase
transitions in the system-detector dynamics. We show that already conventional
superconductor-normal metal hybrid circuits exhibit a variety of topological
phases, including an open quantum system version of a fractional Josephson
effect. Surprisingly, quasiparticles, usually considered a detrimental side
effect, are here a necessary ingredient to observe nontrivial transport
behaviour.
