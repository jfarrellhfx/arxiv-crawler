<h3>Conformal-invariance of 2D quantum turbulence in an exciton-polariton  fluid of light</h3>

The similarities of quantum turbulence with classical hydrodynamics allow
quantum fluids to provide essential models of their classical analogue, paving
the way for fundamental advances in physics and technology. Recently,
experiments on 2D quantum turbulence observed the clustering of same-sign
vortices in strong analogy with the inverse energy cascade of classical fluids.
However, self-similarity of the turbulent flow, a fundamental concept in the
study of classical turbulence, has so far remained largely unexplored in
quantum systems. Here, thanks to the unique features of exciton-polaritons, we
measure the scale invariance of velocity circulations and show that the cascade
process follows the universal scaling of critical phenomena in 2D. We
demonstrate this behaviour from the statistical analysis of the experimentally
measured incompressible velocity field and the microscopic imaging of the
quantum fluid. These results can find wide application in both quantum and
classical 2D turbulence.

<h3>Gap-Dependent Hydrodynamic Lubrication in Conformal Contacts</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17694</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We show that the hydrodynamic lubrication of contacting conformal surfaces
with a typical texture height gives rise to a universal behaviour in the
Stribeck curve in which the friction coefficient shows an anomalous power-law
dependence on the Sommerfeld number, $\mu \sim S^{2/3}$. When the gap height
drops below the `texture length scale', deviations from $S^{2/3}$ occur, which
may resemble the onset of elasto-hydrodynamic and mixed lubrication. Within
this framework, we analyse literature data for oral processing and find
$S^{2/3}$ scaling with deviations consistent with measured lengthscales.

<h3>Anomalous Scaling for Hydrodynamic Lubrication of Conformal Surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17696" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17696</a>
<br>
<i>James A. Richards, Patrick B. Warren, Daniel J. M. Hodgson, Alex Lips, Wilson C. K. Poon</i>
<br>
<br>
The hydrodynamic regime of the Stribeck curve giving the friction coefficient
$\mu$ as a function of the dimensionless relative sliding speed (the Sommerfeld
number, $S$) of two contacting non-conformal surfaces is usually considered
trivial, with $\mu \sim S$. We predict that for conformal surfaces contacting
over large areas, a combination of independent length scales gives rise to a
universal power-law with a non-trivial exponent, $\mu\sim S^{2/3}$, for a thick
lubrication film. Deviations as the film thins (decreasing $S$) may
superficially resemble the onset of elastohydrodynamic lubrication, but are due
to a crossover between hydrodynamic regimes. Our experiments as well as recent
measurements of chocolate lubrication confirm these predictions.

<h3>Equilibrium Quantum Impurity Problems via Matrix Product State Encoding  of the Retarded Action</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the $0+1$ dimensional imaginary-time path integral formulation of quantum
impurity problems, the retarded action encodes the hybridization of the
impurity with the bath. In this Article, we explore the computational power of
representing the retarded action as matrix product state (RAMPS). We focus on
the challenging Kondo regime of the single-impurity Anderson model, where
non-perturbative strong-correlation effects arise at very low energy scales. We
demonstrate that the RAMPS approach reliably reaches the Kondo regime for a
range of interaction strengths $U$, with a numerical error scaling as a weak
power law with inverse temperature. We investigate the convergence behavior of
the method with respect to bond dimension and time discretization by analyzing
the error of local observables in the full interacting problem and find
polynomial scaling in both parameters. Our results show that the RAMPS approach
offers promise as an alternative tool for studying quantum impurity problems in
regimes that challenge established methods, such as multi-orbital systems.
Overall, our study contributes to the development of efficient and accurate
non-wavefunction-based tensor-network methods for quantum impurity problems.

<h3>Negative refraction of Weyl phonons at twin quartz interfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17227</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In nature, $\alpha$-quartz crystals frequently form contact twins - two
adjacent crystals with the same chemical structure but different
crystallographic orientation, sharing a common lattice plane. As
$\alpha$-quartz crystallises in a chiral space group, such twinning can occur
between enantiomorphs with the same handedness or with opposite handedness.
Here, we use first-principle methods to investigate the effect of twinning and
chirality on the bulk and surface phonon spectra, as well as on the topological
properties of phonons in $\alpha$-quartz. We demonstrate that, even though the
dispersion appears identical for all twins along all high-symmetry lines and at
all high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, the dispersions can be distinct
at generic momenta for some twin structures. Furthermore, when the twinning
occurs between different enantiomorphs, the charges of all Weyl nodal points
flip, which leads to mirror symmetric isofrequency contours of the surface
arcs. We show that this allows negative refraction to occur at interfaces
between certain twins of $\alpha$-quartz.

<h3>Evolution of local relaxed states and the modelling of viscoelastic  fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17242</a>
<br>
<i>Muhanna A. H Alrashdi, Giulio G. Giusteri</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce a class of continuum mechanical models aimed at describing the
behavior of viscoelastic fluids by incorporating concepts originated in the
theory of solid plasticity. Within this class, even a simple model with
constant material parameters is able to qualitatively reproduce a number of
experimental observations in both simple shear and extensional flows, including
linear viscoelastic properties, the rate dependence of steady-state material
functions, the stress overshoot in incipient shear flows, and the difference in
shear and extensional rheological curves. Furthermore, by allowing the
relaxation time of the model to depend on the total strain, we can reproduce
some experimental observations of the non-attainability of steady flows in
uniaxial extension, and link this to a concept of polymeric jamming or
effective solidification. Remarkably, this modelling framework helps in
understanding the interplay between different mechanisms that may compete in
determining the rheology of non-Newtonian materials.

<h3>Structure-Dynamics Relationship in Al-Mg-Si Liquid Alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17264" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17264</a>
<br>
<i>Alaa Fahs, Philippe Jarry, NoÃ«l Jakse</i>
<br>
<br>
Enhancing properties and performances of aluminium alloys by a control of
their solidification is pivotal in automotive and aerospace industries. The
fundamental role of the structure-diffusion relationship is investigated for
Al-Mg-Si liquid alloys taken as a prototype of Al-6xxx. For this purpose, first
principles-based molecular dynamics simulations were performed for various Si
and Mg content for Al-rich compositions, including the binary alloy
counterparts. Results indicate that Mg and/or Si in alloys create a more
compact ordering around Al than in pure Al, lowering diffusion. Mg promotes
icosahedral short-range order, while Si displays a preference towards cubic
local ordering, impacting diffusion based on their respective content. It
suggests a mechanism whereby an increase in Mg content generally lowers the
diffusion of each species, whereas an increase in Si content enhances their
diffusion, providing insights for future alloy design.

<h3>Speeding up high-throughput characterization of materials libraries by  active learning: autonomous electrical resistance measurements</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17277" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17277</a>
<br>
<i>Felix Thelen, Lars Banko, Rico Zehl, Sabrina Baha, Alfred Ludwig</i>
<br>
<br>
High-throughput experimentation enables efficient search space exploration
for the discovery and optimization of new materials. However, large search
spaces of, e.g., compositionally complex materials, require decreasing
characterization times significantly. Here, an autonomous measurement algorithm
was developed, which leverages active learning based on a Gaussian process
model capable of iteratively scanning a materials library based on the highest
uncertainty. The algorithm is applied to a four-point probe electrical
resistance measurement device, frequently used to obtain indications for
regions of interest in materials libraries. Ten materials libraries with
different complexities of composition and property trends are analyzed to
validate the model. By stopping the process before the entire library is
characterized and predicting the remaining measurement areas, the measurement
efficiency can be improved drastically. As robustness is essential for
autonomous measurements, intrinsic outlier handling is built into the model and
a dynamic stopping criterion based on the mean predicted covariance is
proposed. A measurement time reduction of about 70-90% was observed while still
ensuring an accuracy of above 90%.

<h3>Evidence of quasi-2D Fermi surface and non-trivial electronic topology  in kagome lattice magnet GdV6Sn6 using de Haas van Alphen oscillations</h3>

<br>
<i>C. Dhital, G. Pokharel, B. Wilson, I. Kendrick, M.M. Asmar, D. Graf, J. Guerrero-Sanchez, R. Gonzalez Hernandez, S.D. Wilson</i>
<br>
<br>
The shape of the Fermi surface, the effective mass of carriers, and the
topologically non-trivial nature of electronic bands of kagome magnet GdV6Sn6
are investigated using de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations measurements. Our
temperature and angle dependent torque magnetometry measurements reveal at
least seven different frequencies ranging from ~90 T up to ~9000 T. These
frequencies correspond to extremal areas of Fermi surface ranging from ~1% up
to 50% of the first Brillouin zone, qualitatively consistent with electronic
structure calculations. The angle dependent dHvA oscillations frequencies
indicate that all pockets of Fermi surface are mostly two-dimensional. We also
find evidence of the presence of lighter (0.58 m0) as well as heavier (2.25 m0)
electrons through the analysis of the temperature dependence of dominant
frequencies, reflecting the features of correlated and Dirac like dispersions
in the electronic structure. The estimation of the Berry phase indicates the
topologically non-trivial nature of the lowest frequency band containing
lighter electrons. This is consistent with the presence of Dirac-like linear
dispersion in the electronic structure.

<h3>A geometric method to determine chromonics' planar anchoring strength</h3>

<br>
Chromonic nematics are lyotropic liquid crystals that have already been known
for half a century, but have only recently raised interest for their potential
applications in life sciences. Determining elastic constants and anchoring
strengths for rigid substrates has thus become a priority in the
characterization of these materials. Here, we present a method to determine
chromonics' planar anchoring strength. We call it geometric as it is based on
recognition and fitting of the stable equilibrium shapes of droplets surrounded
by the isotropic phase in a thin cell with plates enforcing parallel alignments
of the nematic director. We apply our method to shapes observed in experiments;
they resemble elongated rods with round ends, which are called batonnets. Our
theory also predicts other droplets' equilibrium shapes, which are either
slender and round, called discoids, or slender and pointed, called tactoids. In
particular, sufficiently small droplets are expected to display shape
bistability, with two equilibrium shapes, one tactoid and one discoid,
exchanging roles as stable and metastable shapes upon varying their common
area.

<h3>Determination of the Spacing Between Hydrogen-Intercalated  Quasi-Free-Standing Monolayer Graphene and 6H-SiC(0001) Using  Total-Reflection High-Energy Positron Diffraction</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
We have investigated the structure of hydrogen-intercalated
quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) grown on 6H-SiC(0001) by
employing total-reflection high-energy positron diffraction (TRHEPD). At least
nine diffraction spots of the zeroth order Laue zone were resolved along
<11-20> and three along <1-100>, which are assigned to graphene, SiC and higher
order spots from multiple diffraction on both lattices. We further performed
rocking curve analysis based on the full dynamical diffraction theory to
precisely determine the spacing between QFMLG and the SiC substrate. Our study
yields a spacing of d = 4.18(6)\r{A} that is in excellent agreement with the
results from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations published previously.

<h3>Orbital Hall effect and orbital edge states caused by s electrons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17295" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17295</a>
<br>
<i>Oliver Busch, Ingrid Mertig, BÃ¶rge GÃ¶bel</i>
<br>
<br>
An orbital current can be generated whenever an object has a translational
and rotational degree of freedom. In condensed matter physics, intra-atomic
contributions to the transverse orbital transport, labeled orbital Hall effect,
rely on propagating wave packets that must consist of hybridized atomic
orbitals. However, inter-atomic contributions have to be considered as well
because they give rise to a new mechanism for generating orbital currents. As
we show, even wave packets consisting purely of s electrons can transport
orbital angular momentum if they move on a cycloid trajectory. We introduce the
kagome lattice with a single s orbital per atom as the minimal model for the
orbital Hall effect and observe the cycloid motion of the electrons in the
surface states.

<h3>Waveguiding in massive two-dimensional Dirac systems</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The study of waveguide propagating modes is essential for achieving
directional electronic transport in two-dimensional materials. Simultaneously,
exploring potential gaps in these systems is crucial for developing devices
akin to those employed in conventional electronics. Building upon the
theoretical groundwork laid by Hartmann et al., which focused on implementing
waveguides in pristine graphene monolayers, this work delves into the impact of
a waveguide on two-dimensional gapped Dirac systems. We derive exact solutions
encompassing wave functions and energy-bound states for a secant-hyperbolic
attractive potential in gapped graphene, with a gap generated by sublattice
asymmetry or a Kekul\'e-distortion. These solutions leverage the inherent
properties and boundary conditions of the Heun polynomials. Our findings
demonstrate that the manipulation of the number of accessible energy-bound
states, i.e., transverse propagating modes, relies on factors such as the width
and depth of the potential as well as the gap value of the two-dimensional
material.

<h3>Non-equilibrium spin accumulation and magneto-conductance in chiral  nanojunctions from density-functional $\&$ group theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17312" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17312</a>
<br>
<i>M. A. GarcÃ­a-BlÃ¡zquez, W. Dednam, J. J. Palacios</i>
<br>
<br>
It is theoretically well established that a spin-dependent electron
transmission generally appears in chiral systems, even without magnetic
components, as long as a strong spin-orbit coupling is present in some of its
elements. However, how this translates into the so-called chirality-induced
spin selectivity in experiments, where the system is taken out of equilibrium,
is still debated. Aided by non-equilibrium DFT-based quantum transport
calculations, here we show that, when spatial symmetries that forbid a finite
spin polarization in equilibrium are broken, a \textit{net} spin accumulation
appears at finite bias in an arbitrary two-terminal nanojunction. Furthermore,
when a suitably magnetized detector is introduced in the system, the net spin
accumulation, in turn, translates into a finite magneto-conductance. The
symmetry prerequisites are mostly analogous to those for the spin polarization
at any bias, with the vectorial nature given by the direction of magnetization.

<h3>Can Symmetric Tilt Grain Boundaries Represent Polycrystals?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17336" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17336</a>
<br>
<i>Malik Wagih, Christopher A. Schuh</i>
<br>
<br>
Grain boundaries control a wide variety of bulk properties in polycrystalline
materials, so simulation methods like density functional theory are routinely
used to study their structure-property relationships. A standard practice for
such simulations is to use compact, high-symmetry (coincident site lattice)
boundaries as representatives of the much more complex polycrystalline grain
boundaries. In this letter, we question this practice by quantitatively
comparing the spectra of atomic sites and properties amongst grain boundaries.
We show, using solute segregation as an example property, that highly symmetric
tilt boundaries (with {\Sigma} values less than 10) will fail to capture
polycrystalline grain boundary environments, and thus lead to incorrect
quantitative and qualitative insights into their behavior.

<h3>Optical Dipole Structure and Orientation of GaN Defect Single-Photon  Emitters</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17339</a>
<br>
<i>Yifei Geng, Debdeep Jena, Gregory D. Fuchs, Warren R. Zipfel, Farhan Rana</i>
<br>
<br>
GaN has recently been shown to host bright, photostable, defect single photon
emitters in the 600-700 nm wavelength range that are promising for quantum
applications. The nature and origin of these defect emitters remain elusive. In
this work, we study the optical dipole structures and orientations of these
defect emitters using the defocused imaging technique. In this technique, the
far-field radiation pattern of an emitter in the Fourier plane is imaged to
obtain information about the structure of the optical dipole moment and its
orientation in 3D. Our experimental results, backed by numerical simulations,
show that these defect emitters in GaN exhibit a single dipole moment that is
oriented almost perpendicular to the wurtzite crystal c-axis. Data collected
from many different emitters shows that the angular orientation of the dipole
moment in the plane perpendicular to the c-axis exhibits a distribution that
shows peaks centered at the angles corresponding to the nearest Ga-N bonds and
also at the angles corresponding to the nearest Ga-Ga (or N-N) directions.
Moreover, the in-plane angular distribution shows little difference among
defect emitters with different emission wavelengths in the 600-700 nm range.
Our work sheds light on the nature and origin of these GaN defect emitters.

<h3>Enhancement of high-order harmonic generation in graphene by  mid-infrared and terahertz fields</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17346" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17346</a>
<br>
<i>Wenwen Mao, Angel Rubio, Shunsuke A. Sato</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene
under mid-infrared (MIR) and terahertz (THz) fields based on a quantum master
equation. Numerical simulations show that MIR-induced HHG in graphene can be
enhanced by a factor of 10 for fifth harmonic and a factor of 25 for seventh
harmonic under a THz field with a peak strength of 0.5 MV/cm by optimizing the
relative angle between the MIR and THz fields. To identify the origin of this
enhancement, we compare the fully dynamical calculations with a simple
thermodynamic model and a nonequilibrium population model. The analysis shows
that the enhancement of the high-order harmonics mainly results from a coherent
coupling between MIR- and THz-induced transitions that goes beyond a simple
THz-induced population contribution.

<h3>Scaling of Defect-Induced Low-Energy Majorana Excitations in the Kitaev  Magnet $Î±$-RuCl$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The excitations in the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) can be described by Majorana
fermions, which have characteristic field dependence of bulk gap and
topological edge modes. In the high-field state of layered honeycomb magnet
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, experimental results supporting these Majorana features have
been reported recently. However, there are challenges due to sample dependence
and the impact of inevitable disorder on the KSL is poorly understood. Here we
study how low-energy excitations are modified by introducing point defects in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ using electron irradiation, which induces site vacancies and
exchange randomness. High-resolution measurements of the temperature dependence
of specific heat $C(T)$ under in-plane fields $H$ reveal that while the
field-dependent Majorana gap is almost intact, additional low-energy states
with $C/T=A(H)T$ are induced by introduced defects. At low temperatures, we
obtain the data collapse of $C/T\sim H^{-\gamma}(T/H)$ expected for a
disordered quantum spin system, but with an anomalously large exponent
$\gamma$. This leads us to find a new power-law scaling of the coefficient
$A(H)$ with the field-sensitive Majorana gap. These results imply that the
disorder induces low-energy linear Majorana excitations, which may be
considered as a weak localization effect of Majorana fermions in the KSL.

<h3>Spin Swapping for an Exchange Magnon Spin Current</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17383" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17383</a>
<br>
<i>Shuting Cui, Peng Yan, Wei Luo, Xiaofei Yang, Yue Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose the spin swapping effect for an exchange magnon spin current in a
perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic medium with in plane anisotropy on the
surface. The excitation of a magnon current flowing along an in-plane direction
with an out-of-plane spin polarization leads to the generation of a secondary
exchange spin current propagating along the out-of-plane direction,
characterized by an in-plane spin polarization. The resulting exchange magnon
spin current can induce an inverse spin Hall voltage of micro-volts. The
exchange coupling at the interface between regions with different magnetic
anisotropies plays a crucial role in generating the spin swapping effect. This
is in contrast to the recently reported spin swapping for an exchange spin
current in a canted antiferromagnet due to the Dzyaloshiskii-Moriya
interaction.

<h3>Variational approach to the two-dimensional Bose polaron</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17397" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17397</a>
<br>
<i>Yasufumi Nakano, Meera M. Parish, Jesper Levinsen</i>
<br>
<br>
An impurity particle interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) leads
to the formation of a quasiparticle known as the Bose polaron. We investigate
the properties of the two-dimensional Bose polaron, applying a variational
ansatz that contains up to two Bogoliubov excitations of the BEC. Similar to
its three-dimensional counterpart, we observe the existence of two
quasiparticle branches, namely the attractive and the repulsive polarons, at
different coupling strengths. We find that their energies agree well with
recent quantum Monte Carlo calculations. In particular, we observe that the
inclusion of two excitations is crucial to capture the attractive polaron
energy towards the regime of strong attraction, where the quasiparticle
properties are dominated by few-body correlations. We also calculate the
attractive polaron effective mass and residue, where we find significant
differences between considering a weakly interacting Bose medium and taking the
non-interacting limit, signalling enhanced impurity dressing by excitations in
the latter case. By contrast, the spectral weight of the metastable repulsive
polaron is largely insensitive to the interactions in the BEC and the number of
Bogoliubov excitations. Our model may be experimentally realized in dilute
atomic vapors and atomically thin semiconductors.

<h3>Phase transition in fluctuations of interacting spins at infinite  temperature</h3>

The high temperature limit of interacting spins is usually not associated
with ordering or critical phenomena. Nevertheless, spontaneous fluctuations of
a local spin polarization at equilibrium have nontrivial dynamics even in this
limit. Here, we demonstrate that the spin noise power spectrum of these
fluctuations can undergo discontinuous changes as a function of an external
magnetic field. As a simple illustration, we consider a model of Ising-like
long range spin-spin interactions with a transverse magnetic field as a control
parameter. This system undergoes a phase transition associated with
disappearance of the noise power peak responsible for the most detrimental
decoherence effect of the interactions. \end{abstract}

<h3>Symmetric Mass Generation of KÃ¤hler-Dirac Fermions from the  Perspective of Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</h3>

<br>
<br>
The K\"ahler-Dirac fermion, recognized as an elegant geometric approach,
offers an alternative to traditional representations of relativistic fermions.
Recent studies have demonstrated that symmetric mass generation (SMG) can
precisely occur with two copies of K\"ahler-Dirac fermions across any spacetime
dimensions. This conclusion stems from the study of anomaly cancellation within
the fermion system. Our research provides an alternative understanding of this
phenomenon from a condensed matter perspective, by associating the interacting
K\"ahler-Dirac fermion with the boundary of bosonic symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) phases. We show that the low-energy bosonic fluctuations in a
single copy of the K\"ahler-Dirac fermion can be mapped to the boundary modes
of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-classified bosonic SPT state, protected by an inversion
symmetry universally across all dimensions. This implies that two copies of
K\"ahler-Dirac fermions can always undergo SMG through interactions mediated by
these bosonic modes. This picture aids in systematically designing SMG
interactions for K\"ahler-Dirac fermions in any dimension. We present the exact
lattice Hamiltonian of these interactions and validate their efficacy in
driving SMG.

Phonon splitting of the longitudinal optical and transverse optical modes
(LO-TO splitting), a ubiquitous phenomenon in three-dimensional (3D) polar
materials, is essential for the formation of the 3D phonon polaritons. Theories
predict that the LO-TO splitting will break down in two-dimensional (2D) polar
systems, but direct experimental verification is still missing. Here, using
monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a prototypical example, we report
the direct observation of the breakdown of LO-TO splitting and the finite slope
of the LO phonons at the center of the Brillouin zone in 2D polar materials by
inelastic electron scattering spectroscopy. Interestingly, the slope of the LO
phonon in our measurements is lower than the theoretically predicted value for
a freestanding monolayer due to the screening of the Cu foil substrate. This
enables the phonon polaritons (PhPs) in monolayer h-BN/Cu foil to exhibit
ultra-slow group velocity (~ 5 x 10^-6 c, c is the speed of light) and
ultra-high confinement (~ 4000 times smaller wavelength than that of light).
Our work reveals the universal law of the LO phonons in 2D polar materials and
lays a physical foundation for future research on 2D PhPs.

We propose a loop optimization algorithm based on nuclear norm regularization
for tensor network. The key ingredient of this scheme is to introduce a rank
penalty term proposed in the context of data processing. Compared to standard
variational periodic matrix product states method, this algorithm can
circumvent the local minima related to short-ranged correlation in a simpler
fashion. We demonstrate its performance when used as a part of the tensor
network renormalization algorithms [S. Yang, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 118, 110504 (2017)] for the critical 2D Ising model. The scale
invariance of the renormalized tensors is attained with higher accuracy while
the higher parts of the scaling dimension spectrum are obtained in a more
stable fashion.

Defects play an important role in determining the type of carriers as well as
on tuning the physical properties of layered materials. In this study, we have
demonstrated that by varying the growth kinetics one can control the defects
and can achieve electrons or holes dominated Bi2Te3 single crystals using
modified Bridgman method. The correlation between structural defects and the
type of dominant charge carriers in crystals are discussed using X-Ray
diffraction and Hall resistivity. Electrons are found to be originating from Te
vacancy type defects, while holes are manifested from predominant structural
defects viz. Bi_Te antisite defects or interstitial Te atoms. We observe that
the alteration of charger carriers from electrons to holes have enhanced
magnetoresistance (MR) from 103% to 224%. The enhancement in MR emerges from 2D
multichannel quantum coherent conduction mechanism.

<i>Pritam Bhattacharyya, Thorben Petersen, Nikolay A. Bogdanov, Liviu Hozoi</i>
<br>
<br>
Exchange underpins the magnetic properties of quantum matter. In its most
basic form, it occurs through the interplay of Pauli's exclusion principle and
Coulomb repulsion, being referred to as Coulomb exchange. Pauli's exclusion
principle combined with inter-atomic electron hopping additionally leads to
kinetic exchange and superexchange. Here we disentangle the different exchange
channels in anisotropic Kitaev-Heisenberg context. By quantum chemical
computations, we show that anisotropic Coulomb exchange, completely neglected
so far in the field, may be as large as (or even larger than) other
contributions -- kinetic exchange and superexchange. This opens new
perspectives onto anisotropic exchange mechanisms and sets the proper
conceptual framework for further research on tuning Kitaev-Heisenberg
magnetism.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the altermagnetic properties of strongly-correlated transition
metal oxides considering the family of the quasi two-dimensional A2BO4 and
three-dimensional ABO3. As a test study, we analyze the Mott insulators Ca2RuO4
and YVO3. In both cases, the orbital physics is extremely relevant in the t2g
subsector with the presence of an orbital-selective Mott physics in the first
case and of a robust orbital-order in the second case. Using first-principles
calculations, we show the presence of an orbital-selective altermagnetism in
the case of Ca2RuO4. In the case of YVO3, we study the altermagnetism as a
function of the magnetic ordering and of the Coulomb repulsion U. We find that
the altermagnetism is present in all magnetic orders with the symmetries of the
Brillouin zone depending on the magnetic order. Finally, the Coulomb repulsion
enhances the non-relativistic spin-splitting making the strongly-correlated
systems an exciting playground for the study of the altermagnetism.

<br>
Bi-layer Kagome compounds provide an exciting playground where the interplay
of topology and strong correlations can give rise to exotic phases of matter.
Motivated by recent first principles calculation on such systems (Phys. Rev.
Lett 125, 026401), reporting stabilization of a Chern metal with topological
nearly-flat band close to Fermi level, we build minimal models to study the
effect of strong electron-electron interactions on such a Chern metal. Using
approriate numerical and analytical techniques, we show that the topologically
non-trivial bands present in this system at the Fermi energy can realize
fractional Chern insulator states. We further show that if the time-reversal
symmetry is restored due to destruction of magnetism by low dimensionality and
fluctuation, the system can realize a superconducting phase in the presence of
strong local repulsive interactions. Furthermore, we identify an interesting
phase transition from the superconducting phase to a correlated metal by tuning
nearest-neighbor repulsion. Our study uncovers a rich set of non-trivial phases
realizable in this system, and contextualizes the physically meaningful regimes
where such phases can be further explored.

Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a nonequilibrium phase separation
that has a different origin from equilibrium phase separation induced by
attractive interactions. Similarities and differences in collective behaviors
between these two types of phase separation have been intensely discussed.
Here, to study another kind of similarity between MIPS and attraction-induced
phase separation under a nonequilibrium condition, we perform simulations of
active Brownian particles with uniaxially anisotropic self-propulsion (uniaxial
ABPs) in two dimensions. We find that (i) long-range density correlation
appears in the homogeneous state, (ii) anisotropic particle configuration
appears in MIPS, where the anisotropy removes the possibility of microphase
separation suggested for isotropic ABPs [X.-Q. Shi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
125, 168001 (2020)], and (iii) critical phenomena for the anisotropic MIPS
presumably belong to the universality class for two-dimensional uniaxial
ferromagnets with dipolar long-range interactions. Properties (i)-(iii) are
common to the well-studied randomly driven lattice gas (RDLG), which is a
particle model that undergoes phase separation by attractive interactions under
external driving forces, suggesting that the origin of phase separation is not
essential for macroscopic behaviors of uniaxial ABPs and RDLG. Based on the
observations in uniaxial ABPs, we construct a coarse-grained Langevin model,
which shows properties (i)-(iii) and corroborates the generality of the
findings.

<h3>Quantized Conductance by Accelerated Electrons</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
One-dimensional quantized conductance is derived from the electrons in a
homogeneous electric field by calculating the traveling time of the accelerated
motion and the number of electrons in the one-dimensional region. As a result,
the quantized conductance is attributed to the finite time required for
ballistic electrons to travel a finite length. In addition, this model requires
no Joule heat dissipation, even if the conductance is a finite value, because
the electric power is converted to kinetic energy of electrons. Furthermore,
the relationship between the non-equilibrium source-drain bias $V_\mathrm{sd}$
and wavenumber $k$ in a one-dimensional conductor is shown as $k \propto
\sqrt{V_\mathrm{sd}}$. This correspondence accounts for the wavelength of the
coherent electron flows emitted from a quantum point contact. Furthermore, it
explains the anomalous $0.7 \cdot 2e^2/h$ ($e$ is the elementary charge, and
$h$ is the Plank's constant) conductance plateau as a consequence of the
perturbation gap at the crossing point of the wavenumber-directional-splitting
dispersion relation. We propose that this splitting is caused by the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction induced by the potential gradient of the quantum well at
quantum point contacts.

<i>Sanjoy Kr. Mahatha, Paolo Moras, Valerio Bellini, Polina M. Sheverdyaeva, Claudia Struzzi, Luca Petaccia, Carlo Carbone</i>
<br>
<br>
The discovery of (4x4) silicene formation on Ag(111) raised the question on
whether silicene maintains its Dirac fermion character, similar to graphene, on
a supporting substrate. Previous photoemission studies indicated that the
{\pi}-band forms Dirac cones near the Fermi energy, while theoretical
investigations found it shifted at deeper binding energy. By means of
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory
calculations we show instead that the {\pi}-symmetry states lose their local
character and the Dirac cone fades out. The formation of an interface state of
free-electron-like Ag origin is found to account for spectral features that
were theoretically and experimentally attributed to silicene bands of
{\pi}-character.

<h3>MeLM, a generative pretrained language modeling framework that solves  forward and inverse mechanics problems</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a flexible multi-modal mechanics language model, MeLM, applied to
solve various nonlinear forward and inverse problems, that can deal with a set
of instructions, numbers and microstructure data. The framework is applied to
various examples including bio-inspired hierarchical honeycomb design, carbon
nanotube mechanics, and protein unfolding. In spite of the flexible nature of
the model-which allows us to easily incorporate diverse materials, scales, and
mechanical features-it performs well across disparate forward and inverse
tasks. Based on an autoregressive attention-model, MeLM effectively represents
a large multi-particle system consisting of hundreds of millions of neurons,
where the interaction potentials are discovered through graph-forming
self-attention mechanisms that are then used to identify relationships from
emergent structures, while taking advantage of synergies discovered in the
training data. We show that the model can solve complex degenerate mechanics
design problems and determine novel material architectures across a range of
hierarchical levels, providing an avenue for materials discovery and analysis.
Looking beyond the demonstrations reported in this paper, we discuss other
opportunities in applied mechanics and general considerations about the use of
large language models in modeling, design, and analysis that can span a broad
spectrum of material properties from mechanical, thermal, optical, to
electronic.

<br>
<br>
Spin-triplet superconductors provide an ideal platform for realizing
topological superconductivity with emergent Majorana quasiparticles. The
promising candidate is the recently discovered superconductor UTe$ _2$, but the
symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remains highly controversial.
Here we determine the superconducting gap structure by the thermal conductivity
of ultra-clean UTe$ _2$ single crystals. We find that the $a$ axis thermal
conductivity divided by temperature $\kappa/T$ in zero-temperature limit is
vanishingly small for both magnetic fields $\mathbf{H}||a$ and $\mathbf{H}||c$
axes up to $H/H_{c2}\sim 0.2$, demonstrating the absence of any types of nodes
around $a$ axis contrary to the previous belief. The present results, combined
with the reduction of the NMR Knight shift in the superconducting state,
indicate that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the isotropic
$A_u$ representation with a fully gapped pairing state, analogous to the B
phase of superfluid $ ^3$He. These findings reveal that UTe$ _2$ is likely to
be a long-sought three-dimensional (3D) strong topological superconductor
characterized by a 3D winding number, hosting helical Majorana surface states
on any crystal plane.

We demonstrate the possibility of a coupling between the magnetization
direction of a ferromagnet and the tilting angle of adsorbed achiral molecules.
To illustrate the mechanism of the coupling, we analyze a minimal Stoner model
that includes Rashba spin-orbit coupling due to the electric field on the
surface of the ferromagnet. The proposed mechanism allows us to study magnetic
anisotropy of the system with an extended Stoner-Wohlfarth model, and argue
that adsorbed achiral molecules can change magnetocrystalline anisotropy of the
substrate. Our research's aim is to motivate further experimental studies of
the current-free chirality induced spin selectivity effect involving both
enantiomers.

<i>Vishnu Deo Mishra, G. Pratap, Arun Roy</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the experimental investigations on a liquid crystal comprised of
thiophene-based achiral bent-core banana shaped molecules. The results reveal
the presence of a short range nematic phase at high temperatures and a
long-range SmA phase at lower temperatures, which transits to a SmC phase on
further cooling the sample. Practically no layer contraction was observed
across the SmA to SmC transition, indicating the de Vries nature of the SmA
phase. Interestingly, the crystallization does not occur on cooling the sample
till 223 K; instead, a glass transition at 271 K was observed. The dielectric
spectroscopy studies carried out on the sample reveal the presence of a
dielectric mode whose relaxation process is of the Cole-Cole type. The
relaxation frequency of the mode was found to drop rapidly with decreasing
temperature, further confirming the glassy behavior. The variation of
relaxation frequency with temperature follows the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann
equation indicating the fragile glassy nature of the sample.

The phase behaviour of systems composed of an arbitrary high number of

a virial expansion up to second order of the concentrations of the components.
Formal analytical expressions for the spinodal and critical manifolds in N
dimensions are derived, simplifying the calculations for the composition of the
co-existing phases. The present analytical procedure complements previous
attempts to handle spinodal decomposition for many components, e.g. one using a
statistical approach based on Random Matrix Theory. Our results hold promise
for addressing liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytosol of living cells,
which is currently a highly active field of research. The results are also
relevant for predicting effects of polydispersity on phase behaviour in more
classical fields, like polymer and food technology.

The recently discovered ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb) exhibit intriguing quantum
phenomena including superconductivity, electronic nematicity, and abundant
topological states, which provide promising platforms for studying kagome
superconductivity, band topology, and charge orders. In this work, we
comprehensively study various properties of ATi$_3$Bi$_5$ including
superconductivity under pressure and doping, band topology under pressure,
thermal conductivity, heat capacity, electrical resistance, and spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) using first-principles calculations. Calculated
superconducting transition temperature ($\mathrm{ T_{c}}$) of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$
and RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ at ambient pressure are about 1.85 and 1.92K. When subject
to pressure, $\mathrm{ T_{c}}$ of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ exhibits a special valley and
dome shape, which arises from quasi-two-dimensional to three-dimensional
isotropic compression within the context of an overall decreasing trend.
Furthermore, $\mathrm{ T_{c}}$ of RbTi$_3$Bi$_5$ can be effectively enhanced up
to 3.09K by tuning the kagome van Hove singularities (VHSs) and flat band
through doping. Pressure can also induce abundant topological surface states at
the Fermi energy ($\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$) and tune VHSs across
$\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$. Additionally, our transport calculations are in
excellent agreement with recent experiments, confirming the absence of charge
density wave. Notably, SHC of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ can reach as large as 226$
\hbar\cdot (e\cdot \Omega \cdot cm) ^{-1} $ at $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{F}}$. Our
work provides a timely and detailed analysis of the rich physical properties
for ATi$_3$Bi$_5$, offering valuable insights for further explorations and

We develop a self-supervised ensemble learning (SSEL) method to accurately
classify distinct types of phase transitions by analyzing the fluctuation
properties of machine learning outputs. Employing the 2D Potts model and the 2D
Clock model as benchmarks, we demonstrate the capability of SSEL in discerning
first-order, second-order, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions,
using in-situ spin configurations as the input features. Furthermore, we show
that the SSEL approach can also be applied to investigate quantum phase
transitions in 1D Ising and 1D XXZ models upon incorporating quantum sampling.
We argue that the SSEL model simulates a special state function with
higher-order correlations between physical quantities, and hence provides
richer information than previous machine learning methods. Consequently, our
SSEL method can be generally applied to the identification/classification of
phase transitions even without explicit knowledge of the underlying theoretical
models.

We investigate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between two identical
graphene strip gratings, laid on finite dielectric substrate. By using the
scattering matrix (S-matrix) approach derived from the Fourier Modal Method
with local basis functions (FMM-LBF), we fully take into account the high-order
electromagnetic diffractions, the multiple scattering and the exact 2D feature
of the graphene strips. We show that the non-additivity, which is one of the
most interesting features of the CLF in general, is significantly high and can
be modulated in situ without any change in the actual material geometry, by
varying the graphene chemical potential. This study can open the deeper
experimental exploration of the non-additive features of CLF with micro- or

A Laval nozzle can accelerate expanding gas above supersonic velocities,
while cooling the gas in the process. This work investigates this process for
microscopic Laval nozzles by means of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations of statioary flow, using grand canonical Monte-Carlo particle
reservoirs. We study the expansion of a simple fluid, a mono-atomic gas
interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential, through an idealized nozzle with
atomically smooth walls. We obtain the thermodynamic state variables pressure,
density, and temperature, but also the Knudsen number, speed of sound,
velocity, and the corresponing Mach number of the expanding gas for nozzles of
different sizes. We find that the temperature is well-defined in the sense that
the each velocity components of the particles obey the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution, but it is anisotropic, especially for small nozzles. The velocity
auto-correlation function reveals a tendency towards condensation of the cooled
supersonic gas, although the nozzles are too small for the formation of
clusters. Overall we find that microscopic nozzles act qualitatively like
macroscopic nozzles in that the particles are accelerated to supersonic speeds
while their thermal motion relative to the stationary flow is cooled. We find
that, like macroscopic Laval nozzles, microscopic nozzles also exhibit a sonic
horizon, which is well-defined on a microscopic scale. The sonic horizon is
positioned only slightly further downstream compared to isentropic expansion
through macroscopic nozzles, where it is situated in the most narrow part. We
analyze the sonic horizon by studying spacetime density correlations, i.e.\ how
thermal fluctuations at two positions of the gas density are correlated in time
and find that after the sonic horizon there are indeed no upstream correlations
on a microscopic scale.

The distribution of the first-passage time $T_a$ for a Brownian particle with
drift $\mu$ subject to hitting an absorber at a level $a>0$ is well-known and
given by $\gamma(T_a) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2 \pi T_a^3} } e^{-\frac{(a-\mu
T_a)^2}{2 T_a}}$ which is normalized only if $\mu \geq 0$. In this article, we
show that there are two other families of diffusion processes (the first with
one parameter and the second with two parameters) having the same first
passage-time distribution when $\mu <0$. In both cases we establish the
propagators and study in detail these new processes. An immediate consequence
is that the distribution of the first-passage time does not allow us to know if
the process comes from a drifted Brownian motion or from one of these new
processes.

We show that a Skyrmion in a classical bipartite antiferromagnetic lattice
can be spatially displaced in a controlled manner by externally applied spin
waves. We reveal the relation between the Skyrmion motion and the spin wave
properties. To this end, we derive a classical spin wave formalism which is
tailored to the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional square lattice. The
antiferromagnetic spin waves can be classified into two types with respect to
their polarization, with two modes each. The circularly polarized spin waves
oscillate with different amplitudes in the respective sublattices and induce a
Skyrmion Hall effect. The two modes are symmetric under sublattices exchange
and determine the overall sign of the Hall angle. Linearly polarized spin waves
oscillate elliptically, however, with the same amplitude on each sublattice.
These accelerate the Skyrmion solely into their own propagation direction. The
two modes are symmetric under component x-y exchange and impact Bloch- or
N\'eel Skyrmions differently. Our results indicate possible technical
applications of spin-wave driven Skyrmion motion. As one example we propose a
racetrack where spin waves pump Skyrmions along the track in antiferromagnets.

The van der Waals (vdWs) forces between monolayers has been a unique
distinguishing feature of exfoliable materials since the first isolation of
graphene. However, the vdWs interaction of exfoliable materials with their
substrates and how this interface force influences their interaction with the
environment is yet to be well understood.Here, we experimentally and
theoretically unravel the role of vdWs forces between the recently rediscovered
wide band gap p-type vdW semiconductor violet phosphorus (VP), with various
substrates (including, SiO$_2$, mica, Si, Au) and quantify how VP stability in
air and its interaction with its surroundings is influenced by the interface
force.Using a combination of infrared nanoimaging and theoretical modeling we
find the vdWs force at the interface to be a main factor that influences how VP
interacts with its surroundings.In addition, the hydrophobicity of the
substrate and the substrate surface roughness modify the vdWs force there by
influencing VP stability. Our results could guide in the selection of
substrates when vdW materials are prepared and more generally highlight the key
role of interface force effects that could significantly alter physical
properties of vdWs materials.

orientational order in two dimensions, which is prohibited in equilibrium
systems. The existence of long-range order in active matter systems was
predicted first by a numerical model and proven analytically by dynamic
renormalization group analysis. Experimental evidence for long-range order with
giant number fluctuations has been provided in some experimental systems
including microswimmers such as swimming bacteria and electrokinetic Janus
particles. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the
theoretical descriptions of long-range order in collective motion of active
matter systems and an overview of the experimental efforts in the two
prototypical microswimmer experimental systems. We also offer critical
assessments of how and when such long-range order can be achieved in
experimental systems. By comparing numerical, theoretical, and experimental
results, we discuss the future challenges in active matter physics.

The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a rich and versatile model,
which in one spatial dimension has stationary solutions similar to those of the
linear Schr\"odinger equation as well as more exotic solutions such as solitary
waves and quantum droplets. We present a unified theory of the NLSE, showing
that all stationary solutions of the cubic-quintic NLSE can be classified
according to a single number called the cross-ratio. Any two solutions with the
same cross-ratio can be converted into one another using a conformal
transformation. We also demonstrate a conformal duality between solutions of
cubic-quintic NLSEs and lower-order NLSEs. The same analysis can be applied to
the Newtonian dynamics of classical particles with polynomial potentials. Our
framework provides a deeper understanding of the connections between the
physics of the NLSE and the mathematics of algebraic curves and conformal
symmetry.

We demonstrate a strong influence of the phonon environment on the coherent
dynamics of the quantum dot (QD)-cavity system in the quantum strong coupling
regime. This regime is implemented in the nonlinear QD-cavity QED and can be
reliably measured by heterodyne spectral interferometry. We present a
semi-analytic asymptotically exact path integral-based approach to the
nonlinear optical response of this system, which includes two key ingredients:
Trotter's decomposition and linked-cluster expansion. Applied to the
four-wave-mixing optical polarization, this approach provides access to
different excitation and measurement channels, as well as to higher-order
optical nonlinearities and quantum correlators. Furthermore, it allows us to
extract useful analytic approximations and analyze the nonlinear optical
response in terms of quantum transitions between phonon-dressed states of the
anharmonic Jaynes-Cummings (JC) ladder. Being well described by these
approximations at low temperatures and small exciton-cavity coupling, the exact
solution deviates from them for stronger couplings and higher temperatures,
demonstrating remarkable non-Markovian effects, spectral asymmetry, and strong
phonon renormalization of the JC ladder.

Strong correlations lead to emergent excitations at low energies. When
combined with symmetry constraints, they may produce topological electronic
states near the Fermi energy. Within this general framework, here we address
the topological features in iron-based superconductors. We examine the effects
of orbital-selective correlations on the band inversion in the iron
chalcogenide FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ near its doping of optimal superconductivity,
within a multiorbital model and using a $U(1)$ slave spin theory. The orbital
selectivity of the quasiparticle spectral weight, along with its counterpart of
the energy level renormalization, leads to a band inversion and Dirac node
formation pinned to the immediate vicinity of the Fermi energy. Our work
demonstrates both the naturalness and robustness of the topological properties
in FeSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, and uncovers a new setting in which strong
correlations and space-group symmetry cooperate in generating strongly
correlated electronic topology.

<h3>Exploring the lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalide Sn$_2$BCh$_2$X$_3$  materials space for photovoltaic applications</h3>

Quaternary mixed-metal chalcohalides (Sn$_2$BCh$_2$X$_3$) are emerging as
promising lead-free perovskite-inspired photovoltaic absorbers. Motivated by
recent developments of a first Sn$_2$BCh$_2$X$_3$-based device, we used density
functional theory to identify lead-free Sn$_2$BCh$_2$X$_3$ materials that are
structurally and energetically stable within Cmcm, Cmc2$_1$ and P2$_1$/c space
groups and have a band gap in the range of 0.7 to 2.0 eV to cover out- and
indoor photovoltaic applications. A total of 27 Sn$_2$BCh$_2$X$_3$ materials
were studied, including Sb, Bi, In for B-site, S, Se, Te for Ch-site and Cl,
Br, I for X-site. We identified 12 materials with a direct band gap that meet
our requirements, namely: Sn$_2$InS$_2$Br$_3$, Sn$_2$InS$_2$I$_3$,
Sn$_2$InSe$_2$Cl$_3$, Sn$_2$InSe$_2$Br$_3$, Sn$_2$InTe$_2$Br$_3$,
Sn$_2$InTe$_2$Cl$_3$, Sn$_2$SbS$_2$I$_3$, Sn$_2$SbSe$_2$Cl$_3$,
Sn$_2$SbSe$_2$I$_3$, Sn$_2$SbTe$_2$Cl$_3$, Sn$_2$BiS$_2$I$_3$ and
Sn$_2$BiTe$_2$Cl$_3$. A database scan reveals that 9 out of 12 are new
compositions. For all 27 materials, P2$_1$/c is the thermodynamically preferred
structure, followed by Cmc2$_1$. In Cmcm and Cmc2$_1$ mainly direct gaps occur,
whereas mostly indirects in P2$_1$/c. To open up the possibility of band gap
tuning in the future, we identified 12 promising
Sn$_2$B$_{1-{a}}$B$'_{a}$Ch$_{2-{b}}$Ch$'_{b}$X$_{3-{c}}$X$_{c}$ alloys which
fulfill our requirements and additional 69 materials by combining direct and
indirect band gap compounds.

<h3>Boundary-induced topological transition in an open SSH model</h3>

We consider a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain to which we attach a semi-infinite
undimerized chain (lead) to both ends. We study the effect of the openness of
the SSH model on its properties. A representation of the infinite system using
an effective Hamiltonian allows us to examine its low-energy states in more
detail. We show that, as one would expect, the topological edge states
hybridize as the coupling between the systems is increased. As this coupling
grows, these states are suppressed, while a new type of edge state emerges from
the trivial topological phase. These new states, referred to as phase-inverted
edge states, are localized low-energy modes very similar to the edge states of
the topological phase. Interestingly, localization occurs on a new shifted
interface, moving from the first (and last) site to the second (and second to
last) site. This suggests that the topology of the system is strongly affected
by the leads, with three regimes of behavior. For very small coupling the
system is in a well-defined topological phase; for very large coupling it is in
the opposite phase; in the intermediate region, the system is in a transition
regime.

<h3>The dynamics of crack front waves in 3D material failure</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Crack front waves (FWs) are dynamic objects that propagate along moving crack
fronts in 3D materials. We study FW dynamics in the framework of a 3D
phase-field framework that features a rate-dependent fracture energy
$\Gamma(v)$ ($v$ is the crack propagation velocity) and intrinsic lengthscales,
and quantitatively reproduces the high-speed oscillatory instability in the
quasi-2D limit. We show that in-plane FWs feature a rather weak time
dependence, with decay rate that increases with $d\Gamma(v)/dv\!>\!0$, and
largely retain their properties upon FW-FW interactions, similarly to a related
experimentally-observed solitonic behavior. Driving in-plane FWs into the
nonlinear regime, we find that they propagate slower than predicted by a linear
perturbation theory. Finally, by introducing small out-of-plane
symmetry-breaking perturbations, coupled in- and out-of-plane FWs are excited,
but the out-of-plane component decays under pure tensile loading. Yet,
including a small anti-plane loading component gives rise to persistent coupled
in- and out-of-plane FWs.

<h3>A Twist On Active Membranes: Odd Mechanics, Spontaneous Flows and Shape  Instabilities</h3>

<br>
<br>
Living systems are chiral on multiple scales, from constituent biopolymers to
large scale morphology, and their active mechanics is both driven by chiral
components and serves to generate chiral morphologies. We describe the
mechanics of active fluid membranes in coordinate-free form, with focus on
chiral contributions to the stress. These generate geometric `odd elastic'
forces in response to mean curvature gradients but directed perpendicularly. As
a result, they induce tangential membrane flows that circulate around maxima
and minima of membrane curvature. When the normal viscous force amplifies
perturbations the membrane shape can become linearly unstable giving rise to
shape instabilities controlled by an active Scriven-Love number. We describe
examples for spheroids, membranes tubes and helicoids, discussing the relevance
and predictions such examples make for a variety of biological systems from the
sub-cellular to tissue level.

<h3>Dynamical Hall responses of disordered superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
We extend the Mattis-Bardeen theory for the dynamical response of
superconductors to include different types of Hall responses. This is possible
thanks to a recent modification of the quasiclassical Usadel equation, which
allows for analyzing Hall effects in disordered superconductors and including
the precise frequency dependence of such effects. Our results form a basis for
analyzing dynamical experiments especially on novel thin-film superconductors,
where ordinary Hall and spin Hall effects can both show up.

<br>
<br>
The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom in solids is a
topic of intense research. Experience and intuition suggest that structural
changes drive conduction electron behavior, because the large number of valence
electrons dominate the structural properties. As part of a seminal paper
written over sixty years ago, Lifshitz discussed an alternative possibility:
lattice softening driven by conduction electrons at topological Fermi surface
transitions. The effect he predicted, however, was small, and has not been
convincingly observed. Using measurements of the stress-strain relationship in
the ultra-clean metal Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, we reveal a huge softening of the
Young's modulus at a Lifshitz transition of a two-dimensional Fermi surface,
and show that it is indeed entirely driven by the conduction electrons of the
relevant energy band.

<h3>Majorana-mediated thermoelectric transport in multiterminal junctions</h3>

The unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) is one of the
most outstanding problems of condensed matter physics. Thermal transport
provides a detection tool that is sensitive to these chargeless quasiparticles.
We study thermoelectric transport between metallic leads transverse to a
Josephson junction. The central double quantum dot hosts conventional or
topological Andreev states that depend on the phase difference $\phi$. We show
that the presence of MZMs can be identified by a significant amplification of
both the electrical and thermal conductance at $\phi \approx \pi$ as well as
the Seebeck coefficient at $\phi \approx 0$. We further investigate the
robustness of our results against Cooper pair splitting processes.
