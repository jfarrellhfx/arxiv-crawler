<h3>Entropy production and thermodynamic inference for stochastic  microswimmers</h3>

The question of characterization of the degree of non-equilibrium activity in
active matter systems is studied in the context of a stochastic microswimmer
model driven by a chemical cycle. The resulting dynamical properties and
entropy production rate unravel a complex interplay between the chemical and
the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom beyond linear response, which is not
captured by conventional phenomenological approaches. By studying the
precision-dissipation trade-off, a new protocol is proposed in which
microscopic chemical driving forces can be inferred experimentally. Our
findings highlight subtleties associated with the stochastic thermodynamics of
autonomous microswimmers.

<h3>Spin pumping in an altermagnet/normal metal bilayer</h3>

Altermagnetism is a subclass of antiferromagnetism that features
spin-polarized electron bands of a non-relativistic origin despite the absence
of a net magnetiation in the material. We here theoretically study spin pumping
from an altermagnetic insulator into a normal metal. The symmetry properties of
the lattice and spin order of the altermagnet alters the magnon dispersion
compared to a conventional square lattice antiferromagnet. Nevertheless, the
pumped spin current turns out to be equal to the current which is pumped from a
conventional antiferromagnet. This occurs so long that the magnetic field which
sets the altermagnetic spins into precessional motion is spatially homogeneous.
These results show that while spin pumping is possible using altermagnets, the
altermagnetic spin order does not readily leave unique fingerprints in the
pumped spin current. Our model provides a suitable starting point for
investigating more complex models where finite momentum magnons contribute to
spin pumping due to magnon-magnon interactions or where the magnetic field
inducing spin pumping is spatially inhomogeneous.

<h3>Tunable room temperature nonlinear Hall effect from the surfaces of  elementary bismuth thin films</h3>

The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) with time-reversal symmetry constitutes the
appearance of a transverse voltage quadratic in the applied electric field. It
is a second-order electronic transport phenomenon that induces frequency
doubling and occurs in non-centrosymmetric crystals with large Berry curvature
-- an emergent magnetic field encoding the geometric properties of electronic
wavefunctions. The design of (opto)electronic devices based on the NLHE is
however hindered by the fact that this nonlinear effect typically appears at
low temperatures and in complex compounds characterized by Dirac or Weyl
electrons. Here, we show a strong room temperature NLHE in the centrosymmetric
elemental material bismuth synthesized in the form of technologically relevant
polycrystalline thin films. The ($1\,1\,1$) surface electrons of this material
are equipped with a Berry curvature triple that activates side jumps and skew
scatterings generating nonlinear transverse currents. We also report a boost of
the zero field nonlinear transverse voltage in arc-shaped bismuth stripes due
to an extrinsic geometric classical counterpart of the NLHE. This electrical
frequency doubling in curved geometries is then extended to optical second
harmonic generation in the terahertz (THz) spectral range. The strong nonlinear
electrodynamical responses of the surface states are further demonstrated by a
concomitant highly efficient THz third harmonic generation which we achieve in
a broad range of frequencies in Bi and Bi-based heterostructures. Combined with
the possibility of growth on CMOS-compatible and mechanically flexible
substrates, these results highlight the potential of Bi thin films for THz
(opto)electronic applications.

<h3>Anomalous long-distance RKKY interaction in quasicrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15228" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15228</a>

<br>
<br>
The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction is a key mechanism to
understand the coupling between localized magnetic moments in the presence of
itinerant electrons. Such indirect exchange coupling generally shows the
typical oscillation with 2$k_F$ where $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum and the power
law decaying as a function of the distance. In this paper, we argue this
paradigm is not valid anymore in quasicrystals and discuss anomalous behavior
of the RKKY interaction in quasicrystals. Rather than the uniform decaying, the
RKKY interaction becomes significant between the moments in non-local region.
In other words, it realizes a strong coupling between the moments which are far
separated, where their distance can be controlled via quasi-periodicity of the
systems. It turns out that such anomalous RKKY interaction is originated from
the critical states of itinerant electrons, which are neither localized nor
extended wave functions and mediate the RKKY interactions on behalf of the
extended itinerant electrons. Moreover, the RKKY interaction also shows the
fractal structure from the self-similarity of the critical wave functions.
Finally, we also discuss a possible non-local manipulation of the magnetic
moments due to such anomalous RKKY coupling in quasicrystals.

<h3>Molecular modelling of odd viscoelastic fluids</h3>

We consider an active, stochastic microscopic model of particles suspended in
a fluid and show that the coarse-grained description of this model renders odd
viscoelasticity. The model is made up of odd dumbbells, each featuring a
robotic device as the bead, which exhibits a particular torque response. We
analytically compute the stress-stress correlator and corroborate the results
using molecular dynamics simulations. We also provide a unified analytical
framework for several experimental and numerical setups designed to elucidate
odd effects in fluids.

<h3>Mott transition and abnormal instability of electronic structure in FeSe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15260</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
FeSe has been extensively investigated in the context of quantum matter,
primarily due to its achievement of the highest superconducting transition
temperature among Fe-based superconductors. Nonetheless, the electron
correlations responsible for the remarkable diversity of physical properties in
FeSe, an unconventional superconductor, remain elusive. In this study, we
undertake a comprehensive investigation of the electronic structure of 2D FeSe
using two state-of-the-art ab-initio many-body methods: the fully
self-consistent GW+EDMFT and LQSGW+DMFT techniques. Strikingly, we find that
the electronic structure of FeSe is not uniquely defined, as it can manifest
both metallic and Mott-insulating states. By carefully accounting for electron
Green's function $G$ and screened Coulomb interaction $W$, Mott-insulator phase
in FeSe is unveiled. As the dimensionality is reduced to 2-D, the local and
non-local screening effects on the Fe-3$d$ orbitals are weakened, and the Mott
transition is driven by the strong on-site Coulomb interaction in its
paramagnetic phase. Our results suggest that Mott physics may play a pivotal
role in shaping the electronic, optical, and superconducting properties of
FeSe.

<h3>Are fermionic conformal field theories more entangled?</h3>

We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical
systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with conformal
field theories (CFTs) in general dimensions, and their corresponding lattice
Hamiltonians. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and shows
universal behaviour, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than
any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting
of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable
entanglement at large separations generalises the 1d result, and indicates that
quantum critical groundstates do not possess long range bipartite entanglement,
at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of
the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and
we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general CFT
results for the moments of the partially transposed density matrix.

<h3>Phase Transitions In An Implicit Solvent Minimal Model Of Lipids: Role  Of Head-Tail Size Ratio</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15278" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15278</a>

We present Monte Carlo simulations under constant NVT conditions on a minimal
three beads coarse grained implicit solvent model of lipid molecules, with the
hydrophilic head represented by one bead and the hydrophobic tail represented
by two beads. We consider two lipids, one with the head and tail bead sizes
equal and the other with the tail beads smaller than the head. When cooled to
the ambient temperature from an initial isotropic phase at high temperature,
the first lipid transforms spontaneously to a lamellar phase while the second
lipid transforms to a micellar phase, showing the crucial role of the head and
tail size ratio on lipid phases.

<h3>Microscopic theory of spin Seebeck effect in antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15292" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15292</a>
<br>

We develop a microscopic theory for the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in N\'eel
and canted phases of antiferromagnetic insulators. We calculate the DC spin
current tunneling from the antiferromagnet to an attached metal, incorporating
the spin-wave theory and the non-equilibrium Green's function approach. Our
result shows a sign change of the spin current at the spin-flop phase
transition between N\'eel and canted phases, which is in agreement with a
recent experiment for the SSE of $\rm Cr_2O_3$ in a semi-quantitative level.
The sign change can be interpreted from the argument based on the density of
states of up- and down-spin magnons, which is related to the polarized-neutron
scattering spectra. The theory also demonstrates that the spin current in the
N\'eel phase is governed by the magnon correlation, while that in the canted
phase consists of two parts: Contributions from not only the magnon dynamics
but also the static transverse magnetization. This result leads to a prediction
that at sufficiently low temperatures, the spin current non-monotonically
changes as a function of magnetic field in the canted phase. Towards a more
unified understanding of the SSE in antiferromagnets, we further discuss some
missing links of theories of SSE: Interface properties, effects of the
transverse spin moment in the canted phase, the spin-orbit coupling in the
metal, etc. Finally, we compare the SSE of antiferromagnets with those of
different magnetic phases such as ferromagnets, ferrimagnets, an
one-dimensional spin liquid, a spin-nematic liquid, and a spin-Peierls
(dimerized) phase.

<h3>A ballistic electron source with magnetically-controlled valley  polarization in bilayer graphene</h3>

<br>
<br>
The achievement of valley-polarized electron currents is a cornerstone for
the realization of valleytronic devices. Here, we report on ballistic coherent
transport experiments where two opposite quantum point contacts (QPCs) are
defined by electrostatic gating in a bilayer graphene (BLG) channel. By
steering the ballistic currents with an out-of-plane magnetic field we observe
two current jets, a consequence of valley-dependent trigonal warping. Tuning
the BLG carrier density and number of QPC modes (m) with a gate voltage we find
that the two jets are present for m=1 and up to m=6, indicating the robustness
of the effect. Semiclassical simulations which account for size quantization
and trigonal warping of the Fermi surface quantitatively reproduce our data
without fitting parameters, confirming the origin of the signals. In addition,
our model shows that the ballistic currents collected for non-zero magnetic
fields are valley-polarized independently of m, but their polarization depends
on the magnetic field sign, envisioning such devices as ballistic current
sources with tuneable valley-polarization.

<h3>Birth and Early Growth of Entanglement by sd Exchange with  Gate-Voltage-Controllable Destiny</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15304" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15304</a>

We investigate bipartite entanglement between two distant parties, \textit{A}
and \textit{B}, comprising local magnetic impurities (or qudits) induced by the
quench through \textit{sd} exchange in a field-effect-transistor geometry. A
wave-function-based time-dependent formalism is employed by including
non-dissipative responses that allow for the control of entanglement via gate
voltages. Our study focuses on the birth and early growth of entanglement, by
introducing environment support states that render site- and layer-resolved
logarithmic negativity (LN) and mutual information (MI). In the minimal set,
where party \textit{A} (\textit{B}) consists of a qubit, we identify
entanglement sudden deaths (ESDs), which are explained by a visualization
picture analyzing the density matrix. Vibrating electron currents facilitate
the birth of entanglement, while they are not required for its growth and
subsistence. The LN emerges near the edge layers in \textit{A} and \textit{B},
while MI shows up outside these two parties within the spacing layer. The MI is
born earlier than the LN. When a gate voltage large enough to disjoint part of
the system is applied within the spacing region, it partially suppresses the
entanglement, quantified by the LN. This suppression does not appear
immediately after the presence of the disjoint voltage. Applying this disjoint
voltage to the site(s) hosting the qudit(s) helps prevent the site- and
layer-resolved LN from encountering ESDs. The local impurities in parties
\textit{A} and \textit{B} are initially of opposite spin directions in an
unentangled state, as can be prepared by two of our proposed protocols.
However, the features described above do not depend on the chosen protocols.

<h3>Lead-free Magnetic Double Perovskites for Photovoltaic and  Photocatalysis Applications</h3>

The magnetic spin degrees of freedom in magnetic materials serve as
additional capability to tune materials properties, thereby invoking
magneto-optical response. Herein, we report the magneto-optoelectronic
properties of a family of lead-free magnetic double perovskites Cs_{2}AgTX_{6}
(T = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; X=Cl, Br, I). This turns out to provide
an extremely fertile series, giving rise to potential candidate materials for
photovoltaic(PV) applications. In conjunction with high absorption coefficient
and high simulated power conversion efficiency for PV applications, few
compounds in this series exhibit novel magnetic character useful for spintronic
applications. The interaction between magnetism and light can have far-reaching
results on the photovoltaic properties as a consequence of the shift in the
defect energy levels due to Zeeman effect. This subsequently affects the
recombination rate of minority carriers, and hence the photoconversion
efficiency. Moreover, the distinct ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic
ordering driven by hybridization and super-exchange mechanism can play a
significant role to break the time-reversal and/or inversion symmetry. Such a
coalescence of magnetism and efficient optoelectronic response has the
potential to trigger magnetic/spin anomalous photovoltaic (non-linear Optical)
effect in this Cs$_{2}$AgTX$_{6}$ family. These insights can thus channelize
the advancement of lead-free double perovskites in magnetic/spin anomalous
photovoltaic field as well.

<h3>Combining linear-scaling quantum transport and machine-learning  molecular dynamics to study thermal and electronic transports in complex  materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15314" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15314</a>
<br>
<i>Zheyong Fan, Yang Xiao, Yanzhou Wang, Penghua Ying, Shunda Chen, Haikuan Dong</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an efficient approach for simultaneous prediction of thermal and
electronic transport properties in complex materials. Firstly, a highly
efficient machine-learned neuroevolution potential is trained using reference
data from quantum-mechanical density-functional theory calculations. This
trained potential is then applied in large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations, enabling the generation of realistic structures and accurate
characterization of thermal transport properties. In addition, molecular
dynamics simulations of atoms and linear-scaling quantum transport calculations
of electrons are coupled to account for the electron-phonon scattering and
other disorders that affect the charge carriers governing the electronic
transport properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this unified approach by
studying thermoelectric transport properties of a graphene antidot lattice.

<h3>Engineering higher order Van Hove singularities in two dimensions: the  example of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The properties of correlated electron materials are often intricately linked
to Van Hove singularities (VHs) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The class
of these VHs is of great importance, with higher order ones -- with power-law
divergence in the density of states -- leaving frequently distinct signatures
in physical properties. We use a new theoretical method to detect and analyse
higher order Van Hove singularities (HOVHs) in two-dimensional materials and
apply it to the electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We
then constrain a low energy model of the VHs of the surface layer of
Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ against angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
quasiparticle interference data to analyse the VHs near the Fermi level. We
show how these VHs can be engineered into HOVHs.

<br>
<i>Daniel G. Allman, Parth Sabharwal, Kevin C. Wright</i>
<br>
<br>
We have measured the rate of spontaneous current formation in ring-shaped
ensembles of fermionic $^6$Li atoms, following a thermal quench through the BCS
superfluid phase transition. For the fastest quenches, the mean square winding
number follows a scaling law with exponent $\sigma$ = 0.24(2), in line with
predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) model for mean-field BCS theory. We use a
hybrid quench protocol involving simultaneous evaporation and interaction
ramps, with a long system lifetime allowing characterization of a different
rate of spontaneous current formation in the slow-quench regime, where
finite-size effects are important. Comparing our observations to a quasi-1D
stochastic Ginzburg-Landau model, we find quantitative agreement for fast
quenches, but only qualitative agreement for slow quenches.

<h3>Metastability and dynamic modes in magnetic island chains</h3>

The uniform states of a model for one-dimensional chains of thin magnetic
islands on a nonmagnetic substrate coupled via dipolar interactions are
described here. Magnetic islands oriented with their long axes perpendicular to
the chain direction are assumed, whose shape anisotropy imposes a preference
for the dipoles to point perpendicular to the chain. The competition between
anisotropy and dipolar interactions leads to three types of uniform states of
distinctly different symmetries, including metastable transverse or remanent
states, transverse antiferromagnetic states, and longitudinal states where all
dipoles align with the chain direction. The stability limits and normal modes
of oscillation are found for all three types of states, even including infinite
range dipole interactions. The normal mode frequencies are shown to be
determined from the eigenvalues of the stability problem.

Approach of mesoscopic state variables to time independent equilibrium sates
(zero law of thermodynamics) gives birth to the classical equilibrium
thermodynamics. Approach of fluxes and forces to fixed points (equilibrium
fluxes and forces) that drive reduced mesoscopic dynamics gives birth to the
rate thermodynamics that is applicable to driven systems. We formulate the rate
thermodynamics and dynamics, investigate its relation to the classical
thermodynamics, to extensions involving more details, to the hierarchy
reformulations of dynamical theories, and to the Onsager variational principle.
We also compare thermodynamic and dynamic critical behavior observed in closed
and open systems. Dynamics and thermodynamics of the van der Waals gas provides
an illustration.

The high-temperature superconductivity in layered cuprates discovered by
Bednorz and M\"uller arrived as a shock. Gradually, the presence of competing
orders, such as antiferromagnetism and charge order, were discovered; however,
the relationship to the superconductivity has been confusing. It so happens
that the original cuprate superconductor family La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$
contains all of the relevant phases, with extreme competition among them, and
analysis of these phases provides strong clues to the nature of the
superconductivity in cuprates.

As global energy demands escalate, and the use of non-renewable resources
become untenable, renewable resources and electric vehicles require far better
batteries to stabilize the new energy landscape. To maximize battery
performance and lifetime, understanding and monitoring the fundamental
mechanisms that govern their operation throughout their life cycle is crucial.
Unfortunately, from the moment batteries are sealed until their end-of-life,
they remain a black box, and our current knowledge of a commercial battery s
health status is limited to current (I), voltage (V), temperature (T), and
impedance (R) measurements, at the cell or even module level during use.
Electrochemical models work best when the battery is new, and as state
reckoning drifts leading to an over-reliance on insufficient data to establish
conservative safety margins resulting in the systematic under-utilization of
cells and batteries. While the field of operando characterization is not new,
the emergence of techniques capable of tracking commercial battery properties
under realistic conditions has unlocked a trove of chemical, thermal, and
mechanical data that has the potential to revolutionize the development and
utilization strategies of both new and used lithium-ion devices. In this
review, we examine the latest advances in non-destructive operando
characterization techniques, including electrical sensors, optical fibers,
acoustic transducers, X-ray-based imaging and thermal imaging (IR camera or
calorimetry), and their potential to improve our comprehension of degradation
mechanisms, reduce time and cost, and enhance battery performance throughout
its life cycle.

Broken symmetries and electronic topology are nicely manifested together in
the second order nonlinear optical responses from topologically nontrivial
materials. While second order nonlinear optical effects from the electric
dipole (ED) contribution have been extensively explored in polar Weyl
semimetals (WSMs) with broken spatial inversion (SI) symmetry, they are rarely
studied in centrosymmetric magnetic WSMs with broken time reversal (TR)
symmetry due to complete suppression of the ED contribution. Here, we report
experimental demonstration of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) in a
magnetic WSM Co$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$S$_{2}$ from the electric quadrupole (EQ)
contribution. By tracking the temperature dependence of the rotation anisotropy
(RA) of SHG, we capture two magnetic phase transitions, with both the SHG
intensity increasing and its RA pattern rotating at $T_{C,1}$=175K and
$T_{C,2}$=120K subsequently. The fitted critical exponents for the SHG
intensity and RA orientation near $T_{C,1}$ and $T_{C,2}$ suggest that the
magnetic phase at $T_{C,1}$ is a 3D Ising-type out-of-plane ferromagnetism
while the other at $T_{C,2}$ is a 3D XY-type all-in-all-out in-plane
antiferromagnetism. Our results show the success of detection and exploration
of EQ SHG in a centrosymmetric magnetic WSM, and hence open the pathway towards
the future investigation of its tie to the band topology.

<br>
<br>
Understanding of the critical atomistic steps during the dehydrogenation
process of liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is important to the design
of cost-efficient, high-performance LOHC catalysts. Based on the density
functional theory (DFT) we studied the thermodynamics and kinetics of the
complete dehydrogenation path of perhydro-N-ethylcarbazole (12H-NEC) on
Ru(0001) surface, involving the adsorption of 12H-NEC, the discharge of H ions
onto Ru surface, and the desorption of H2 and hydrogen-lean NEC. It was found
that the bonding of nH-NEC is significantly strengthened for n $\le$ 4 because
of the flat aromatic ring. Although the whole dehydrogenation process is
endothermic, the release of H from nH-NEC, with H adsorbed onto the Ru surface,
was found to be exothermic. The desorption of flat, hydrogen-lean NEC, which
costs ~255 kJ/mol, was identified as the most energy demanding step. In
addition, the effect of surface morphology on adsorption was studied based on
an amorphous surface model. Overall, the results imply more efficient
dehydrogenation could be achieved from relatively weak bonding of NEC to
catalysts, either through engineering catalyst surface (such as surface defects
or smaller catalyst particles) or different catalyst materials. Our
calculations also revealed possible dealkylation at elevated temperatures.

<h3>O(1) benchmarking of precise rotation in a spin-squeezed Bose-Einstein  condensate</h3>

Benchmarking a high-precision quantum operation is a big challenge for many
quantum systems in the presence of various noises as well as control errors.
Here we propose an $O(1)$ benchmarking of a dynamically corrected rotation by
taking the quantum advantage of a squeezed spin state in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate. Our analytical and numerical results show that tiny rotation
infidelity, defined by $1-F$ with $F$ the rotation fidelity, can be calibrated
in the order of $1/N^2$ by only several measurements of the rotation error for

Hydrogen diffusion is critical to the performance of metals for hydrogen
storage as well as other important applications. As compared to its crystalline
counterpart which follows the Arrhenius relation, hydrogen diffusion in
amorphous metals sometimes are experimentally found to be non-Arrhenian. In
this work we studied the diffusion of hydrogen in amorphous Pd-H and Zr-Cu-H
alloys based on molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations confirm
Arrhenian diffusion behaviour for hydrogen in amorphous alloys, in contrast to
previous theoretical studies which predict non-Arrhenian behaviour. We show
that the simulated non-Arrhenian diffusion based on molecular dynamics could
result from a systematic error related to too short simulation time. We also
discussed the experimental non-Arrhenian behaviour of hydrogen diffusion within
the framework of quantum tunneling and amorphous-amorphous phase
transformations.

<h3>Nematic Phase of the n-Component Cubic-Spin Spin Glass in d=3:  Liquid-Crystal Phase in a Dirty Magnet</h3>

<br>
<br>
A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass
system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the
low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high temperature disordered phase, for
number of components n >= 3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a
liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. This result is
obtained from renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the
hierarchical lattice and, equivalently, approximate on the cubic spatial
lattice. The nematic phase completely intervenes between the spin-glass phase
and the disordered phase. The Lyapunov exponents of the spin-glass chaos are
calculated from n=1 up to n=12 and show odd-even oscillations with respect to
n.

We study the influence of many-body interactions on the transport properties
in a two-site charge Kondo circuit recently implemented in a hybrid
metal-semiconductor double-quantum dot device [W.~Pouse {\it et al.},
Nat.~Phys.~{\bf 19}, 492 (2023)]. There emerge two principal types of
interactions: (i) an intrinsic one, described by the Luttinger liquid model,
and (ii) an induced one, which appears due to the coupling of the system to an
Ohmic environment. Case (i) could be achieved if the charge Kondo circuit
operates in the fractional quantum Hall regime, while case (ii) can be
implemented via a finite number of open ballistic channels coupled to both the
quantum dots. We demonstrate that the conductance scaling for the case of
strong and weak interdot coupling is fully determined by the effective
interaction parameter, which is the combination of the fractional filling
factor $\nu=1/m$ and the number of transmitting channels. Furthermore, we
predict that the fractional filling factor $\nu$ defines a universal Kondo
scaling in the vicinity of a special triple quantum critical point featured by
the emergence of a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion.

As a promising remedy for overcoming the limited ductility and work softening
of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), BMG composites incorporating a B2 crystalline
phase have attracted considerable attention. Here, we explore the formation of
Zr-Co-Al BMG composites by quenching alloys Zr$_{55}$Co$_{31}$Al$_{14}$,
Zr$_{54.5}$Co$_{33.5}$Al$_{12}$, Zr$_{53.5}$Co$_{36.5}$Al$_{10}$,
Zr$_{52.5}$Co$_{37.5}$Al$_{10}$, and Zr$_{43}$Co$_{43}$Al$_{14}$. We found the
first alloy fully amorphous whereas the fifth was fully crystallized upon
quenching. The other three were quenched to generate composite structures, with
a higher fraction of B2 ZrCo phase with increasing Co/Zr ratio and decreasing
Al content. For comparison, the formation of B2 ZrCo in annealed
Zr$_{55}$Co$_{31}$Al$_{14}$ was also studied. For both approaches the influence
of crystalline phases on hardness was examined.

Bloch wave functions of electrons have properties called quantum geometry,
which has recently attracted much attention as the origin of intriguing
physical phenomena. In this paper, we introduce the notion of the
quantum-geometric pair potentials (QGPP) based on the generalized band
representation and thereby clarify how the quantum geometry of electrons is
transferred to the Cooper pairs they form. QGPP quantifies the deviation of
multiband superconductors from an assembly of single-band superconductors and
has a direct connection to the quantum-geometric corrections to thermodynamic
coefficients. We also discuss their potential ability to emulate exotic pair
potentials and engineer intriguing superconducting phenomena including
topological superconductivity.

<br>

Developing an accurate kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) remains a
major hurdle in orbital-free density functional theory. We propose a
machine-learning-based physical-constrained non-local (MPN) KEDF and implement
it with the usage of the bulk-derived local pseudopotentials and plane wave
basis sets in the ABACUS package. The MPN KEDF is designed to satisfy three
exact physical constraints: the scaling law of electron kinetic energy, the
free electron gas limit, and the non-negativity of Pauli energy density. The
MPN KEDF is systematically tested for simple metals, including Li, Mg, Al, and
59 alloys. We conclude that incorporating non-local information for designing
new KEDFs and obeying exact physical constraints are essential to improve the
accuracy, transferability, and stability of ML-based KEDF. These results shed
new light on the construction of ML-based functionals.

<h3>Honeybee-like collective decision making in a kilobot swarm</h3>

<br>
<br>
Drawing inspiration from honeybee swarms' nest-site selection process, we
assess the ability of a kilobot robot swarm to replicate this captivating
example of collective decision-making. Honeybees locate the optimal site for
their new nest by aggregating information about potential locations and
exchanging it through their waggle-dance. The complexity and elegance of
solving this problem relies on two key abilities of scout honeybees:
self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence,
respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site
selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments
demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions
in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this
consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and
interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the
motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated
communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond
its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity
--the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision-making--, we
emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to
living systems and life itself.

<br>
Bipolar thermoelectricity in tunnel junctions between superconductors of
different energy gap has been recently predicted and experimentally
demonstrated. This effect showed thermovoltages up to $\pm150\;\mu$V at
milliKelvin temperatures. Thus, superconducting tunnel junctions can be
exploited to realize a passive single-photon thermoelectric detector $TED$
operating in the broadband range 15 GHz - 50 PHz. In particular, this detector
is expected to show a signal-to-noise ratio of about 15 down to $\nu=50$ GHz
and a operating window of more than 4 decades. Therefore, the $TED$ might find
applications in quantum computing, telecommunications, optoelectronics,
spectroscopy and astro-particle physics.

<h3>Linear magneto-conductivity as a DC probe of time-reversal symmetry  breaking</h3>

<br>
<br>
Several optical experiments have shown that in magnetic materials the
principal axes of response tensors can rotate in a magnetic field. Here we
offer a microscopic explanation of this effect, and propose a closely related
DC transport phenomenon -- an off-diagonal \emph{symmetric} conductivity linear
in a magnetic field, which we refer to as linear magneto-conductivity (LMC).
Although LMC has the same functional dependence on magnetic field as the Hall
effect, its origin is fundamentally different: LMC requires time-reversal
symmetry to be broken even before a magnetic field is applied, and is therefore
a sensitive probe of magnetism. We demonstrate LMC in three different ways: via
a tight-binding toy model, density functional theory calculations on MnPSe$_3$,
and a semiclassical calculation. The third approach additionally identifies two
distinct mechanisms yielding LMC: momentum-dependent band magnetization and
Berry curvature. Finally, we propose an experimental geometry suitable for
detecting LMC, and demonstrate its applicability using Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
simulations. Our results emphasize the importance of measuring the full
conductivity tensor in magnetic materials, and introduce LMC as a new transport
probe of symmetry.

<h3>Rotational Response Induced by Electric Toroidal Dipole</h3>

A ferroaxial ordering, which appears without mirror symmetry parallel to an
electric axial moment, is described by a ferroic alignment of the electric
toroidal (ET) dipole rather than the conventional electric and magnetic
dipoles. Although its emergence requires neither spatial inversion nor
time-reversal symmetry breakings, unconventional transverse responses between
the conjugate physical quantities have been proposed, which are qualitatively
different from those in multiferroic systems without both spatial inversion and
time-reversal symmetries. We theoretically investigate a general relationship
between ferroaxial ordering and its characteristic response tensor. We show
that various rotational responses corresponding to an antisymmetric tensor
component are related to the ferroaxial ordering based on symmetry analysis.
Among them, we propose that second-order nonlinear magnetostriction, where the
strain is induced by a second-order magnetic field, is one of the experimental
setups to identify the ferroaxial ordering. We show its temperature and
magnetic-field-angle dependence by analyzing a fundamental $d$-orbital model
under the tetragonal symmetry.

<h3>Mechanism of charge transport in lithium thiophosphate</h3>

Lithium ortho-thiophosphate ($\textrm{Li}_3\textrm{PS}_4$) has emerged as a
promising candidate for solid-state-electrolyte batteries, thanks to its highly
conductive phases, cheap components, and large electrochemical stability range.
Nonetheless, the microscopic mechanisms of Li-ion transport in
$\textrm{Li}_3\textrm{PS}_4$ are far to be fully understood, the role of
$\textrm{PS}_4$ dynamics in charge transport still being controversial. In this
work, we build machine learning potentials targeting state-of-the-art DFT
references (PBEsol, r$^2$SCAN, and PBE0) to tackle this problem in all known
phases of $\textrm{Li}_3\textrm{PS}_4$ ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$), for
large system sizes and timescales. We discuss the physical origin of the
observed superionic behavior of $\textrm{Li}_3\textrm{PS}_4$: the activation of
$\textrm{PS}_4$ flipping drives a structural transition to a highly conductive
phase, characterized by an increase of Li-site availability and by a drastic
reduction in the activation energy of Li-ion diffusion. We also rule out any
paddle-wheel effects of $\textrm{PS}_4$ tetrahedra in the superionic phases --
previously claimed to enhance Li-ion diffusion -- due to the
orders-of-magnitude difference between the rate of $\textrm{PS}_4$ flips and
Li-ion hops at all temperatures below melting. We finally elucidate the role of
inter-ionic dynamical correlations in charge transport, by highlighting the
failure of the Nernst-Einstein approximation to estimate the electrical
conductivity. Our results show a strong dependence on the target DFT reference,
with PBE0 yielding the best quantitative agreement with experimental
measurements not only for the electronic band-gap but also for the electrical
conductivity of $\beta$- and $\alpha$-$\textrm{Li}_3\textrm{PS}_4$.

Frustrated antiferromagnets offer a captivating platform to study the
intricate relationship of magnetic interactions, geometric constraints, and
emergent phenomena. By controlling spin orientations, these materials can be
tailored for applications in spintronics and quantum information processing.
The research focuses on the interplay of magnetic and exchange anisotropy
effects in artificial heterostructures based on a canonical frustrated
antiferromagnet, UO2. The potential to manipulate the spin directions in this
material and switch between distinct antiferromagnetic states is investigated
using substrate-induced strain. The phenomenon is probed using exchange bias
(EB) effects in stoichiometric UO2/Fe3O4 bilayers. By employing many-body
first-principles calculations magnetic configurations in the UO2 layers are
identified. Even a minor tetragonal distortion triggers a transition between
antiferromagnetic states of different symmetries, driven by a robust alteration
of single-ion anisotropy due to the distortion. Consequently, this change
influences the arrangement of magnetic moments at the UO2/Fe3O4 interface,
affecting the magnitude of exchange bias. The findings showcase how epitaxial
strain can effectively manipulate the antiferromagnetic states in frustrated
antiferromagnets by controlling single-site anisotropy.

Half-Heusler systems host a plethora of different ground states, especially
with non-trivial topology. However, there is still a lack of spectroscopic
insight into the corresponding band inversion in this family. In this work, we
locally explore the half-Heuslers Y$T$Bi ($T =$ Pt and Pd) by means of scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. From our analysis of the (120) surface
plane, we infer that the increase of the spin--orbit coupling upon going from
Pd to Pt is the main player in tuning the surface states from trivial to
topologically non-trivial. Our measurements unveil a ($2 \times 1$)
reconstruction of the (120) surface of both systems. Using density functional
theory calculations, we show that the observed different behavior of the local
density of states near the Fermi level in these two materials is directly
related to the presence of metallic surface states. Our work sheds new light on
a well known tunable family of materials and opens new routes to explore the
presence of topological states of matter in half-Heusler systems and its
microscopic observation.

<br>
<br>
A phase transition is found in Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene at 350 K, by measuring
the complex Young's modulus of self-standing thick films. A step-like softening
and increase of the mechanical losses is found below 350 K, indicative of a
phase transition, where the square of the order parameter is coupled to strain.
It is argued that it should be a ferroelectric transition, most likely of the
sliding (moir\'e) type, due to charge transfer between facing flakes sliding
with respect to each other. If the transition will be confirmed to be
ferroelectric, Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ will be added to the class of metallic
ferroelectrics and open new perspectives of applications, in addition to the
numerous already studied.

This paper presents an extension of the discrete element method using a
phase-field formulation to incorporate grain shape and its evolution. The
introduction of a phase variable enables an effective representation of grain
geometry and facilitates the application of physical laws, such as
chemo-mechanical couplings, for modeling shape changes. These physical laws are
solved numerically using the finite element method coupled in a staggered
scheme to the discrete element model. The efficacy of the proposed Phase-Field
Discrete Element Model (PFDEM) is demonstrated through its ability to
accurately capture the real grain shape in a material subjected to dissolution
only and compute the stress evolution. It is then applied to model the
phenomenon of pressure solution involving dissolution and precipitation in
granular materials at the microscale and enables to reproduce the creep
response observed experimentally. This framework contributes to the enhanced
understanding and simulation of complex behaviors in granular materials and
sedimentary rocks for many geological processes like diagenesis or earthquake
nucleation.

We present the generation of transient polarization gratings at the
nanoscale, achieved using a tailored accelerator configuration of the FERMI
free electron laser. We demonstrate the capabilities of such a transient
polarization grating by comparing its induced dynamics with the ones triggered
by a more conventional intensity grating on a thin film ferrimagnetic alloy.
While the signal of the intensity grating is dominated by the thermoelastic
response of the system, such a contribution is suppressed in the case of the
polarization grating. This exposes helicity-dependent magnetization dynamics
that have so-far remained hidden under the large thermally driven response. We
anticipate nanoscale transient polarization gratings to become useful for the
study of any physical, chemical and biological systems possessing chiral
symmetry.

Excitons in organic crystalline semiconductors play a crucial role in the
operation of optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells, light-emitting
diodes, and photodetectors. The excitonic properties of materials are
dramatically affected by the presence of surfaces and interfaces. In this work,
we investigate the influence of a neutral hydrogen-passivated 1x2 reconstructed
(100) silicon substrate on excitons within the crystalline tetracene layer
deposited on the top of it. Our findings reveal that singlet excitons in the
contact tetracene layer are situated within the continuum of unbound
Wannier-Mott excitonic states in silicon, with noteworthy hybridization between
these states. Consequently, in the contact tetracene layer, all singlet
excitons exhibit a pronounced interlayer charge transfer character, while the
triplet exciton remains confined to the tetracene layer. This makes the singlet
fission effect highly improbable for the contact tetracene layer. Additionally,
the presence of the silicon substrate results in a modification of the
singlet-triplet gap by 144 meV. This change is solely attributed to the
hybridization with excitons in silicon, which influences the exchange energy.
Our results show that the dynamic dielectric screening caused by the substrate
does not impact the singlet-triplet gap but alters the exciton binding
energies.

Upon impulsive optical excitation of solid-state materials, the
non-equilibrium flow of energy from the excited electronic system to the
lattice degrees of freedom typically happens in a few picoseconds. Here we
identified the surface of thin Bi films grown on Si(001) as an additional
subsystem which is excited much slower on a 100 ps timescale that is caused by
decoupling due to mismatched phonon dispersions relations of bulk and surface.
Anharmonic coupling among the phonon systems provides pathways for excitations
which exhibits a 1/T-dependence causing a speed-up of surface excitation at
higher temperatures. A quantitative justification is provided by phonon Umklapp
processes from lattice thermal conductivity of the Bi bulk. Three-temperature
model simulations reveal a pronounced non-equilibrium situation up to
nanoseconds: initially, the surface is colder than the bulk, that situation is
then inverted during cooling and the surface feeds energy back into the bulk
phonon system.

Understanding the excitation spectrum in two-dimensional quantum many-body
systems has long been a challenging task. We present an approach by introducing
an excitation ansatz based on an infinite matrix product state (MPS) on a helix
structure. With the canonical form of MPS states, we can accurately extract key
properties such as energy, degeneracy, spectrum weight, and scaling behavior of
low-energy excited states simultaneously. To validate the effectiveness of this
method, we begin by applying it to the critical point of the transverse-field
Ising model. The extracted scaling exponent of the energy gap closely aligns
with the conformal bootstrap results. Subsequently, we apply this approach to
the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice. We discover that the
degeneracy of lowest-energy excitations serves as a reliable metric for
distinguishing different phases. The phase boundary identified by our method is
consistent with some of the previous findings. The present method provides a
promising avenue for studying the excitation spectrum of two-dimensional
quantum many-body systems.

Fundamental interactions are the basis of the most diverse phenomena in
science that allow the dazzling of possible applications. In this work, we
report a new interaction, which we call chemical-quantum-magnetic interaction.
This interaction arises due to the difference in valence that the Fe3O4/PANI
nanostructure acquires under certain conditions. In this study, PANI activates
the chemical part of the oscillations, leaving the quantum and magnetic part
for the double valence effect and consequently for changing the number of spins
of the nanostructure sites. We also observed using interaction measurements
that chemical-quantum-magnetic interactions oscillate in a subcritical regime
satisfying the behavior of a damped harmonic oscillator.

Topological invariants are global properties of the ground-state wave
function, typically defined as winding numbers in reciprocal space. Over the
years, a number of topological markers in real space have been introduced,
allowing to map topological order in heterogeneous crystalline and disordered
systems. Notably, even if these formulations can be expressed in terms of
lattice-periodic quantities, they can actually be deployed in open boundary
conditions only, as in practice they require computing the position operator
$\mathbf{r}$ which is ill-defined in periodic boundary conditions. Here we
derive a local Chern marker for infinite two-dimensional systems with periodic
boundary conditions in the large supercell limit, where the electronic
structure is sampled with one single point in reciprocal space. We validate our
approach with tight-binding numerical simulations on the Haldane model,
including trivial/topological superlattices made of pristine and disordered
Chern insulators. The strategy introduced here is very general and could be
applied to other topological invariants and geometrical quantities in any
dimension.

Frustrated magnets with degenerate ground states exhibit exotic ground states
and rich phase structures when perturbations and/or thermal fluctuations lift
the degeneracy. In two-dimensional models with short-range interactions,
continuous symmetries cannot spontaneously break at finite temperatures,
leading to the suppression of conventional magnetic long-range ordering (LRO).
In this paper, we numerically study the classical $J_1$-$J_2$ $XY$
antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice as a prototype model of such frustrated
magnets, where $J_2$ denotes the next-nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. We
map out the $J_2$-$T$ phase diagram of this model employing extensive classical
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The obtained phase diagram features
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions of $q=0$,
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic orders, and octupole orders, in addition to
finite-temperature phase transitions of both ferrochiral and antiferrochiral
long-range orders. Additionally, we find a non-trivial first-order transition
for antiferromagnetic $J_2/J_1 < 0$. The origin of this transition is discussed
in the context of non-local loop structures present in local $120^\circ$ spin
structures.

The spin-chain compound Sr3NiPtO6 is known to have a nonmagnetic ground
state. We have investigated the nature of ground state of Sr3NiPtO6 using
magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$, heat capacity $C_{\rm p}(T)$, muon spin
relaxation ($\mu$SR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The
$\chi(T)$ and $C_{\rm p}(T)$ do not exhibit any pronounced anomaly that can be
associated with a phase transition to a magnetically ordered state. Our $\mu$SR
data confirm the absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.04 K.
Furthermore, the muon spin relaxation rate increases below 20 K and exhibits
temperature independent behavior at low temperature, very similar to that
observed in a quantum spin-liquid system. The INS data show a large excitation
near 8~meV, and the analysis of the INS data reveals a singlet CEF ground state
with a first excited CEF doublet state at $\Delta_{\rm CEF}$ = 7.7 meV. The
estimated CEF parameters reveal a strong planar anisotropy in the calculated
$\chi(T)$, consistent with the reported behavior of the $\chi(T)$ of single
crystal Sr3NiPtO6. We propose that the nonmagnetic singlet ground state and a
large $\Delta_{\rm CEF}$ (much larger than the exchange interaction
$\mathcal{J}_{\rm ex}$) are responsible for the absence of long-range magnetic
ordering and can mimic a classical spin-liquid behavior in this quasi-1D spin
chain system Sr3NiPtO6. The classical spin-liquid ground state observed in
Sr3NiPtO6 is due to the single-ion property, which is different from the
quantum spin-liquid ground state observed in geometrically frustrated systems,
where two-ion exchanges play an important role.

<h3>Designing superselectivity in linker-mediated multivalent nanoparticle  adsorption</h3>

Using a statistical mechanical model and numerical simulations, we provide
the design principle for the bridging energy ($\xi$) and linker density
($\rho$) dependent superselectivity in linker-mediated multivalent nanoparticle
adsorption. When the bridges are insufficient, the formation of multiple
bridges leads to both $\xi$- and $\rho$-dependent superselectivity. Whereas,
when the bridges are excessive, the system becomes insensitive to bridging
energy due to entropy-induced self-saturation and shows a superselective
desorption with respect to the linker density. Counterintuitively, lower linker
density or stronger bridging energy enhances the superselectivity. These
findings not only help understand relevant biological processes but also open
up opportunities for applications in biosensing, drug delivery, and
programmable self-assembly.

Phase transitions in nonequilibrium dynamics of many body quantum systems,the
so-called dynamical phases transition (DPTs), play an important role for
understanding various dynamical phenomena observed in different branches of
physics.In general, there have two types of DPTs, the first one refers to the
phase transition that is characterized by distinct evolution behaviors of a
physical observable, while the second one is marked by the nonanalyticities in
the rate function of the initial state survival probability. Here, we focus on
such DPTs from both quantum and semiclassical perspectives in a spinor
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), an ideal platform to investigate nonequilibrium
dynamics.By using the sudden quench process, we demonstrate that the system
exhibits both types of DPTs as the control parameter quenches through the
critical one, referring to as the critical quench. We show analytically how to
determine the critical quenches by means of the semiclassical approach and
carry out a detailed examination on both semiclassical and quantum signatures
of two types of DPTs. Moreover, we further reveal that the occurrence of DPTs
is closely connected to the separatrix in the underlying classical system. Our
findings provide more insights into the properties of DPTs and verify the
usefulness of semiclassical analysis for understanding DPTs in quantum systems
with well-defined semiclassical limit.

<br>
<br>
We developed a theory describing elementary excitations in the Bose-Fermi
system induced by circularly polarized light in a two-dimensional (2D) gas of
charge carriers with different masses. In such a hybrid system, the Fermi
subsystem is a degenerate Fermi gas, whereas the Bose subsystem is a condensate
of the light-induced composite bosons consisting of two fermions (electrons or
holes) with different effective masses. The interaction of the single-particle
excitations and the collective excitations (plasmons) in the Fermi subsystem
with the Bogoliubov collective modes (bogolons) in the Bose subsystem is
analyzed. The renormalization and damping (lifetime) of the excitations are
calculated, and the possibility of their experimental observation is discussed.
The developed theory can be applied to describe 2D condensed-matter structures
containing charge carriers with different effective masses, including
transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and semiconductor quantum wells.

<h3>Cubic anisotropy of hole Zeeman splitting in semiconductor nanocrystals</h3>

<i>M. A. Semina, A. A. Golovatenko, A. V. Rodina</i>
<br>
<br>
We study theoretically cubic anisotropy of Zeeman splitting of a hole
localized in semiconductor nanocrystal. This anisotropy originates from three
contributions: crystallographic cubically-symmetric spin and kinetic energy
terms in the bulk Luttinger Hamiltonian and the spatial wave function
distribution in a cube-shaped nanocrystal. From symmetry considerations, an
effective Zeeman Hamiltonian for the hole lowest even state is introduced,
containing a spherically symmetric and a cubically symmetric term. The values
of these terms are calculated numerically for spherical and cube-shaped
nanocrystals as functions of the Luttinger Hamiltonian parameters. We
demonstrate that the cubic shape of the nanocrystal and the cubic anisotropy of
hole kinetic energy (so called valence band warping) significantly affect
effective $g$ factors of hole states. In both cases, the effect comes from the
cubic symmetry of the hole wave functions in zero magnetic field. Estimations
for the effective $g$ factor values in several semiconductors with zinc-blende
crystal lattices are made. Possible experimental manifestations and potential
methods of measurement of the cubic anisotropy of the hole Zeeman splitting are
suggested.

In this paper, we introduce a novel, adapted approach for computing gas
adsorption properties in porous materials. We analyze the Dubinin-Polanyi's
adsorption model and investigate various frameworks to estimate its required
essential components. Those are linked to physicochemical properties of the
adsorbates, such as the vapor saturation pressure and density in the adsorbed
state. To conduct this analysis, we obtain adsorption isotherms for several
metal-organic frameworks, encompassing a range of pore sizes, shapes, and
chemical compositions. We then apply and evaluate multiple combinations of
models for saturation pressure and density.
After the evaluation of the method, we propose a working thermodynamic model
for computing adsorption isotherms, which entails using the critical isochore
as an approximation of the saturation pressure above the critical point and
applying Hauer's method with a universal thermal expansion coefficient for
density in the adsorbed state. This framework is applicable not only to
simulated isotherms but also to experimental data from the literature for
various molecules and structures, demonstrating robust predictive capabilities
and high transferability. Our method showcases superior performance in terms of
accuracy, generalizability, and simplicity compared to existing methods
currently in use. For the first time, a method starting from a single
adsorption curve and based on physically interpretable parameters can predict
adsorption properties across a wide range of operating conditions.

Magnetite has long been investigated across many disciplines due to the
interplay between its ferroic order parameters, namely its ferrimagnetism,
ferroelasticity and ferroelectricty. Despite this, the experimental difficulty
in measuring low temperature real space images of the ferroelectric domains has
meant that the local behaviour of ferroelectric domains emergent below the 38 K
phase transition have yet to be realised. This work presents real space images
of the ferroelectric domains, and uses piezo force microscopy to, as a function
of temperature, probe the onset of piezoelectricty and ferroelectricity across
the 38 K transition

<h3>Thermal Hall conductivity of electron-doped cuprates: Electrons and  phonons</h3>

<br>
<br>
It has recently become clear that phonons generate a sizable thermal Hall
effect in cuprates, whether they are undoped, electron-doped or hole-doped
(inside the pseudogap phase). At higher doping, where cuprates are reasonably
good metals, mobile electrons also generate a thermal Hall effect, the thermal
equivalent of the standard electrical Hall effect. Here we show that in the
cleanest crystals of the electron-doped cuprate Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, at
high doping, the phonon and electron contributions to the thermal Hall
conductivity $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ are of comparable magnitude, but of opposite
sign. In samples of lower quality, phonons dominate $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$,
resulting in a negative $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ at all temperatures. The fact that
the negative phononic $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ in the metallic state is similar in
magnitude and temperature dependence to that found in the insulating state at
lower doping rules out any mechanism based on skew scattering of phonons off
charged impurities, since a local charge should be screened in the metallic
regime. The phononic $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ is found to persist over the entire
doping range where antiferromagnetic correlations are known to be significant,
suggesting that such correlations may play a role in generating the phonon
thermal Hall effect in electron-doped cuprates. If the same mechanism is also
at play in hole-doped cuprates, the presence of a phononic $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$
below (and only below) the critical doping $p^{\star}$ would be evidence that
spin correlations are a property of the pseudogap phase.

<h3>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Graph Cellular Automata</h3>

Discrete dynamical systems can exhibit complex behaviour from the iterative
application of straightforward local rules. A famous example are cellular
automata whose global dynamics are notoriously challenging to analyze. To
address this, we relax the regular connectivity grid of cellular automata to a
random graph, which gives the class of graph cellular automata. Using the
dynamical cavity method (DCM) and its backtracking version (BDCM), we show that
this relaxation allows us to derive asymptotically exact analytical results on
the global dynamics of these systems on sparse random graphs. Concretely, we
showcase the results on a specific subclass of graph cellular automata with
``conforming non-conformist'' update rules, which exhibit dynamics akin to
opinion formation. Such rules update a node's state according to the majority
within their own neighbourhood. In cases where the majority leads only by a
small margin over the minority, nodes may exhibit non-conformist behaviour.
Instead of following the majority, they either maintain their own state, switch
it, or follow the minority. For configurations with different initial biases
towards one state we identify sharp dynamical phase transitions in terms of the
convergence speed and attractor types. From the perspective of opinion dynamics
this answers when consensus will emerge and when two opinions coexist almost
indefinitely.

Borophosphene is investigated for hydrogen storage by density functional
theory calculations through Li, Na and Ca decoration. Decoration enhances the
binding energy from -0.047 eV/H2 to -0.20 -- -0.42 eV/H2. PDOS and Bader charge
analysis elucidate the role of adatom decoration in charge transfer and better
binding. Up to 10, 12 and 20 H2 molecules can be adsorbed over a single Li, Na
and Ca adatom, respectively, in a supercell of 32 atoms. Desorption temperature
is calculated from the binding energies. A complete discharge of the stored
molecules from decorated borophosphene can be realized in temperature range of
125 to 531 K. Further, decoration at multiple sites of the substrate is
performed to evaluate the theoretical gravimetric density. With Li, Na, and Ca
overloading, gravimetric densities of 6.22%, 5.34%, and 6.08% are obtained. NEB
results show that inter-site energy barriers of the adatoms are larger than
their thermal energy by an order.

<h3>Spin wave excitations in low dimensional systems with large magnetic  anisotropy</h3>

The low energy excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional ferromagnetic
material is dominated by single-magnon excitations that show a gapless
parabolic dispersion relation with the spin wave vector. This occurs as long as
magnetic anisotropy and anisotropic exchange are negligible compared to
isotropic exchange. However, to maintain magnetic order at finite temperatures,
it is necessary to have sizable anisotropy to open a gap in the spin wave
excitation spectrum. We consider four real two-dimensional systems for which
ferromagnetic order at finite temperature has been observed or predicted.
Density functional theory calculations of the total energy differences for
different spin configurations permit us to extract the relevant parameters and
connect them with a spin Hamiltonian. The corresponding values of the Curie
temperature are estimated using a simple model and found to be mostly
determined by the value of the isotropic exchange. The exchange and anisotropy
parameters are used in a toy model of finite-size periodic chains to study the
low-energy excitation spectrum, including single-magnon and two-magnon
excitations. At low energies we find that single-magnon excitations appear in
the spectrum together with two-magnon excitations. These excitations present a
gap that grows particularly for large values of the magnetic anisotropy or
anisotropic exchange, relative to the isotropic exchange.

<h3>Characteristics of $\langle a \rangle$ Screw Dislocations Basal Slip in  Titanium</h3>

<br>
<br>
Plasticity in hexagonal close packed (HCP) metals and alloys such as Titanium
(Ti) and Zirconium (Zr) is carried out by the motion of $\langle a \rangle$
dislocations. Above room temperature, in situ transmission electron microscopy
straining experiments have shown that basal slip of $\langle a \rangle$ screw
dislocations in Ti is activated and its preponderance increases with
temperature. To discern the mechanism of basal slip of these dislocations in
pure Ti, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and nudged elastic band (NEB)
calculations were performed for a screw dislocation gliding on the basal plane.
From MD simulations, basal and pyramidal slip were shown to be intertwined. The
screw dislocation glides by kink pair nucleation and propagation mechanism on
one of the two equiprobable pyramidal planes adjacent to the maximum resolved
shear stress basal plane, before switching to the other pyramidal plane, thus
leading to an average basal slip at low stress and/or high temperature. On the
other hand, NEB calculations revealed that at low stresses kinks do not
nucleate in the pyramidal plane but rather directly in the basal plane fully
compatible with the motion of a screw dislocation confined to the basal plane,
in agreement with experimental observations in Ti and Zr. The discrepancy
between these two mechanisms is shown to be related to the thermal activation
of the cross-slip from the pyramidal to the prismatic core configuration of the
$\langle a \rangle$ screw dislocation.

Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene is the best studied physical platform
featuring moire potential induced narrow bands with non-trivial topology and
strong electronic correlations. Despite their significance, the Chern
insulating states observed at a finite magnetic field -- and extrapolating to a
band filling, $s$, at zero field -- remain poorly understood. Unraveling their
nature is among the most important open problems in the province of moir\'e
materials. Here we present the first comprehensive study of interacting
electrons in finite magnetic field while varying the electron density, twist
angle and heterostrain. Within a panoply of correlated Chern phases emerging at
a range of twist angles, we uncover a unified description for the ubiquitous
sequence of states with the Chern number $t$ for $(s,t)=\pm (0,4),
\pm(1,3),\pm(2,2)$ and $\pm(3,1)$. We also find correlated Chern insulators at
unconventional sequences with $s+t\neq \pm 4$, as well as with fractional $s$,
and elucidate their nature.

We study the critical temperature of the superfluid phase transition of

learning using an autoencoder neural network which we directly apply to
time-of-flight images of the fermions. We extract the critical temperature of
the phase transition from trend changes in the data distribution revealed in
the latent space of the autoencoder bottleneck.

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can play a very important role in generating
accurate data needed for constructing potential energy surfaces. We argue that
QMC has advantages in terms of a smaller systematic bias and an ability to
cover phase space more completely. The stochastic noise can ease the training
of the machine learning model. We discuss how stochastic errors affect the
generation of effective models by analyzing the errors within a linear least
squares procedure, finding that there is an advantage to having many relatively
imprecise data points for constructing models. We then analyze the effect of
noise on a model of many-body silicon finding that noise in some situations
improves the resulting model. We then study the effect of QMC noise on two
machine learning models of dense hydrogen used in a recent study of its phase
diagram. The noise enable us to estimate the errors in the model. We conclude
with a discussion of future research problems.

<br>
<br>
In a superconducting weak link, the supercurrent is carried by Andreev bound
states (ABSs) formed by the phase-coherent reflection of electrons and their
time-reversed partners. A single, highly transmissive ABS can serve as an
ideal, compact two-level system, due to a potentially large energy difference
to the next ABS. While the coherent manipulation of such Andreev levels qubits
(ALQs) has been demonstrated, a long-range coupling between two ALQs, necessary
for advanced qubit architectures, has not been achieved, yet. Here, we
demonstrate a coherent remote coupling between two ALQs, mediated by a
microwave photon in a novel superconducting microwave cavity coupler. The
latter hosts two modes with different coupling rates to an external port. This
allows us to perform fast readout of each qubit using the strongly coupled
mode, while the weakly coupled mode is utilized to mediate the coupling between
the qubits. When both qubits are tuned into resonance with the latter mode, we
find excitation spectra with avoided-crossings, in very good agreement with the
Tavis-Cummings model. Based on this model, we identify highly entangled
two-qubit states for which the entanglement is mediated over a distance of six
millimeters. This work establishes ALQs as compact and scalable solid-state
qubits.

We determine the phase diagram of strongly correlated fermions in the
crossover from Bose-Einstein condensates of molecules (BEC) to Cooper pairs of
fermions (BCS) utilizing an artificial neural network. By applying advanced
image recognition techniques to the momentum distribution of the fermions, a
quantity which has been widely considered as featureless for providing
information about the condensed state, we measure the critical temperature and
show that it exhibits a maximum on the bosonic side of the crossover.
Additionally, we back-analyze the trained neural network and demonstrate that
it interprets physically relevant quantities.

One of the prime material candidates to host the axion insulator state is
EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$. First-principles calculations predicted the emergence of
this exotic topological phase based on the assumption of a collinear
antiferromagnetic structure. However, neutron scattering measurements revealed
a more intricate magnetic ground state, characterized by two coexisting
magnetic wavevectors, reached by successive thermal phase transitions. The
proposed high and low temperature phases were a spin helix and a state with
interpenetrating helical and antiferromagnetic order, termed a broken helix,
respectively. Despite its complexity, the broken helix still protects the axion
state because the product of time-reversal and a rotational symmetry is
preserved. Here we identify the magnetic structure associated with these two
phases using a multimodal approach that combines symmetry-sensitive optical
probes, scattering, and group theoretical analysis. We find that the higher
temperature phase hosts a nodal structure rather than a helix, characterized by
a variation of the magnetic moment amplitude from layer to layer, with the
moment vanishing entirely in every third Eu layer. The lower temperature
structure is similar to the broken helix, with one important difference: the
relative orientation of the magnetic structure and the lattice is not fixed,
resulting in an `unpinned broken helix'. As a result of the breaking of
rotational symmetry, the axion phase is not generically protected.
Nevertheless, we show that it can be restored if the magnetic structure is
tuned with externally-applied uniaxial strain. Finally, we present a spin
Hamiltonian that identifies the spin interactions needed to account for the
complex magnetic order in EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$. Our work highlights the
importance of the multimodal approach in determining the symmetry of complex
order-parameters.

We carry out a detailed theoretical study of the electronic and optical
properties of bulk and monolayer bismuth triiodide (BiI$_{3}$), a layered metal
halide, using the ab initio GW+BSE scheme with a full spinorial formulation. We
discuss in detail the effects due to the change of dimensionality and the role
of spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we compute the exciton dispersion by solving
the BSE at finite momentum, also analysing transverse (TE) and longitudinal
(LE) excitons, and the L-T splitting at $\bf{q}\approx\Gamma$. The results
provide a reference for future experimental measurements. In addition, the
interplay between spin-orbit coupling and large binding energy, together with
the role of quantum confinement, confirm that BiI$_{3}$ is an interesting
material for opto-electronic applications and show that it is a good candidate
for the study of exciton dynamics.

Charge and energy are expected to diffuse in interacting systems of fermions
at finite temperatures, even in the absence of disorder, with the interactions
inducing a crossover from the coherent and ballistic streaming of
quasi-particles at early times, to incoherent diffusive behavior at late times.
The relevant crossover timescales and the transport coefficients are both
controlled by the strength of interactions. In this work we develop a numerical
method to simulate such systems at high temperatures, applicable in a wide
range of interaction strengths, by adapting Dissipation-assisted Operator
Evolution (DAOE) to fermions. Our fermion DAOE, which approximates the exact
dynamics by systematically discarding information from high $n$-point
functions, is tailored to capture non-interacting dynamics exactly, thus
providing a good starting point for the weakly interacting problem. Applying
our method to a microscopic model of weakly interacting fermions, we
numerically demonstrate that the crossover from ballistic to diffusive
transport happens at a time $t_D\sim1/\Delta^{2}$ and that the diffusion
constant similarly scales as $D \sim 1/\Delta^2$, where $\Delta$ is the
interaction strength. We substantiate this scaling with a Fermi's golden rule
calculation in the operator spreading picture, interpreting $t_D$ as the
fermion-fermion scattering time and lifetime of the single-particle Green's
function.

The discovery of two-dimensional superconductivity in LAO/KTO (111) and (110)
interfaces has raised significant interest in this system. Here we report the
fabrication of nanoscale direct current superconducting quantum interference
devices (DC-SQUID), created by using a conductive atomic force microscope
(c-AFM) to lithographically control the conductivity at the LAO/KTO(110)
interface. The field modulation of its critical current, I_c (B), corresponds
well with our theoretical modeling, which is consistent with a large kinetic
inductance of the superconducting 2DEG in KTO. The kinetic inductance of the
SQUID is tunable by electrical gating from the back, due to the large
dielectric constant of KTO. The demonstration of SQUID effect in KTO opens up
the possibilities for probing the underlying physics of KTO superconductivity,
such as the role of spin-orbit-coupling, pairing symmetry, and inhomogeneity.
It also further implies that KTO could serve as a foundation for future quantum
devices.
