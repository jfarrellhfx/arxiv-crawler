<h3>Fluctuating kinetic theory and fluctuating hydrodynamics of aligning active particles: the dilute limit</h3>

Kinetic and hydrodynamic theories are widely employed for describing the
collective behaviour of active matter systems. At the fluctuating level, these
have been obtained from explicit coarse-graining procedures in the limit where
each particle interacts weakly with many others, so that the total forces and
torques exerted on each of them is of order unity at all times. Such limit is
however not relevant for dilute systems that mostly interact via alignment;
there, collisions are rare and make the self-propulsion direction to change
abruptly. We derive a fluctuating kinetic theory, and the corresponding
fluctuating hydrodynamics, for aligning self-propelled particles in the limit
of dilute systems. We discover that fluctuations at kinetic level are not
Gaussian and depend on the interactions among particles, but that only their
Gaussian part survives in the hydrodynamic limit. At variance with fluctuating
hydrodynamics for weakly interacting particles, we find that the noise variance
at hydrodynamic level depends on the interaction rules among particles and is
proportional to the square of the density, reflecting the binary nature of the
aligning process. The results of this paper, which are derived for polar
self-propelled particles with polar alignment, could be straightforwardly
extended to polar particles with nematic alignment or to fully nematic systems.

<h3>Superconductivity in the crystallogenide LaFeSiO$_{1-Î´}$ with squeezed FeSi layers</h3>

Pnictogens and chalcogens are both viable anions for promoting Fe-based
superconductivity and intense research activity in the related families has
established systematic correlation between the Fe-anion height and the
superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, with an optimum Fe-anion height of
$\sim$ 1.38 \r{A}. Here, we report the discovery of superconductivity in a
novel compound LaFeSiO$_{1-\delta}$ that incorporates a crystallogen element,
Si, and challenges the above picture: considering the strongly squeezed Fe-Si
height of 0.94 \r{A}, the superconducting transition at $T_{c}$ = 10 K is
unusually high. In the normal state, the resistivity displays non-Fermi-liquid
behavior while NMR experiments evidence weak antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
According to first-principles calculations, the Fermi surface of this material
is dominated by hole pockets without nesting properties, which explains the
strongly suppressed tendency towards magnetic order and suggests that the
emergence of superconductivity materializes in a distinct set-up, as compared
to the standard $s_\pm$- and $d$-wave electron-pocket-based situations. These
properties and its simple-to-implement synthesis make LaFeSiO$_{1-\delta}$ a
particularly promising platform to study the interplay between structure,
electron correlations and superconductivity.
