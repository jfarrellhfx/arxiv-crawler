<h3>Periodic necking of misfit hyperelastic filaments embedded in a soft  matrix</h3>

The necking instability is a precursor to tensile failure and rupture of
materials. A quasistatically loaded free-standing uniaxial specimen typically
exhibits necking at a single location, corresponding to a long wavelength
bifurcation mode. If confined to a substrate or embedded in a matrix, the same
filament can exhibit periodic necking thus creating segments of finite length.
While periodic instabilities have been extensively studied in ductile metal
filaments and thin sheets, less is known about necking in hyperelastic
materials. There is a renewed interest in the role of necking in novel
materials to advance fabrication processes and to explain fragmentation
phenomena observed in 3D printed active biological matter. In both cases
materials are not well described by existing frameworks that employ J2
plasticity, and existing studies ignore the role of misfit stretches that may
emerge in these systems through chemical or biological contraction. To address
these limitations, we first experimentally demonstrate the role of the matrix
on the necking and fragmentation of a compliant embedded filament. Using a
strain softening generalized hyperelastic model, our analytical bifurcation
analysis explains the experimental observations and agrees with numerical
predictions. The analysis reveals 3 distinct bifurcation modes: a long
wavelength necking, recovering the Considere criterion; a periodic necking
observed in our experiments; and a short wavelength mode characterized by
localization along the center cord of the filament and independent of the
film-to-matrix stiffness ratio. We find that the softening coefficient and the
filament misfit stretch can significantly influence the stability threshold and
observed wavelength, respectively. Our results can guide the design and
fabrication of composite materials and explain the fragmentation processes
observed in active biological materials.

Scattering resonances due to the dipole-dipole interaction between ultracold
molecules, induced by static or microwave fields, are studied theoretically. We
develop a method for coupled-channel calculations that can efficiently impose
many short-range boundary conditions, defined by a short-range phase shift and
loss probability as in quantum-defect theory. We study how resonances appear as
the short-range loss probability is lowered below the universal unit
probability. This may become realizable for nonreactive ultracold molecules in
blue-detuned box potentials.

Soliton-based computing is relied on their unique properties for transporting
energy and emerging intact from head-on collisions. Magnetic domain walls are
often referred to as solitons disregarding the strict mathematical definition
requiring the above scattering property. Here we demonstrate the conditions of
elastic and inelastic scattering for spin-orbit torque-induced dynamics of
antiferromagnetic domain walls on the example of a technologically relevant
Mn$_2$Au material. We show that even domain walls with opposite winding numbers
can experience elastic scattering and we present a corresponding phase diagram
as a function of the spin-orbit field strength and duration. The elastic
collision requires minimum domain walls speed which we explain assuming an
attractive potential created by domain wall pair. On the contrary, when the
domain walls move at lower speeds, their collision is inelastic and results in
a dispersing breather. Our findings will be important for the development
soliton-based computing using antiferromagnetic spintronics and we discuss
these perspective on our suggestions of how to create NOT and XOR gates.

<h3>Conditions for the propulsion of a colloid surrounded by a mesoscale  phase separation</h3>

We study a two-dimensional model of an active isotropic colloid whose
propulsion is linked to the interactions between solute particles of the bath.
The colloid catalyzes a chemical reaction in its vicinity, that yields a local
phase separation of solute particles. The density fluctuations of solute
particles result in the enhanced diffusion of the colloid. Using numerical
simulations, we thoroughly investigate the conditions under which activity
occurs, and we establish a state diagram for the activity of the colloid as a
function of the parameters of the model. We use the generated data to unravel a
key observable that controls the existence and the intensity of activity: the
filling fraction of the reaction area. Remarkably, we finally show that
propulsion also occurs in three-dimensional geometries, which confirms the
interest of this mechanism for experimental applications.

Passing from a microscopic discrete lattice system with many degrees of
freedom to a mesoscopic continuum system described by a few coarse-grained
equations is challenging. The common folklore is to take the thermodynamic
limit so that the physics of the discrete lattice describes the continuum
results. The analytical procedure to do so relies on defining a small length
scale (typically the lattice spacing) to coarse-grain the microscopic evolution
equations. Moving from the microscopic scale to the mesoscopic scale then
requires careful approximations. In this work, we numerically test the
coarsening in a Toda chain, which is an interacting integrable system, i.e. a
system with a macroscopic number of conserved charges. Specifically, we study
the spreading of fluctuations by computing the spatiotemporal thermal
correlations with three different methods: (a) Using microscopic molecular
dynamics simulation with a large number of particles; (b) solving the
generalized hydrodynamics equation; (c) solving the linear Euler scale
equations for each conserved quantities. Surprisingly, the results for the
small systems (c) match the thermodynamic results in (a) and (b) for
macroscopic systems. This reiterates the importance and validity of integrable
hydrodynamics in describing experiments in the laboratory, where we typically
have microscopic systems.

<h3>Spin excitation continuum to topological magnon crossover and thermal  Hall conductivity in Kitaev magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02516" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02516</a>
<br>
<i>Emily Z. Zhang, Reja H. Wilke, Yong Baek Kim</i>

There has been great interest in identifying a Kitaev quantum spin liquid
state in frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions. In particular,
the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement
as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More
recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating
for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the
non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An
inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase
transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the
field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at
finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide
insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin
excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the
field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev
interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a
spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the
field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin
structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics
simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized
regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure
factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where
zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine
nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall
conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the
implications of our results to existing and future experiments.

<h3>Mechanically-reconfigurable van der Waals devices via low-friction gold  sliding</h3>

<br>
<br>
Interfaces of van der Waals (vdW) materials such as graphite and hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) exhibit low-friction sliding due to their atomically-flat
surfaces and weak vdW bonding. We demonstrate that microfabricated gold also
slides with low friction on hBN. This enables the arbitrary post-fabrication
repositioning of device features both at ambient conditions as well as in-situ
to a measurement cryostat. We demonstrate mechanically-reconfigurable vdW
devices where device geometry and position are continuously-tunable parameters.
By fabricating slidable top gates on a graphene-hBN device, we produce a
mechanically-tunable quantum point contact where electron confinement and
edge-state coupling can be continuously modified. Moreover, we combine in-situ
sliding with simultaneous electronic measurements to create new types of
scanning probe experiments, where gate electrodes and even entire vdW
heterostructures devices can be spatially scanned by sliding across a target.

We consider the dynamics and stationary regime of a capacitively-shunted
transmon-type qubit in front of a mirror, affected by two signals: probe and
dressing signals. By varying the parameters of these signals and then analyzing
the probe signal (reflected by the atom-mirror system), it is possible to
explore the system dynamics, which can be described by the Bloch equation. The
obtained time-dependent occupation probabilities are related to the
experimentally measured reflection coefficient. The study of this type of
dynamics opens up new horizons for better understanding of the system
properties and underlying physical processes, such as
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana transitions.

<h3>Temperature-dependent Multi-well Free-energy Landscape for Phase  Transitions: PbTiO3 as a Prototype</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02552" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02552</a>
<br>
<i>Yi Wang, Tiannan Yang, Shun-Li Shang, Long-Qing Chen, Zi-Kui Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
It has been a long challenge to analytically construct the quantitative
temperature-dependent multi-well free-energy landscape over the space of order
parameters describing phase transitions and associated critical phenomena. Here
we propose a simple analytical model for the free energy landscape based on a
priori concept of Boltzmann thermal mixing among multiple parabolic potentials
representing different energetically degenerated ground states in contrast to
the popular Landau theory using the high-temperature disordered state as a
reference. The model recovers both the Weiss molecular field theory and the
temperature dependent behaviors of the second order Landau coefficient. It is
rather remarkable that such a simple analytical expression can describe a wide
variety of properties across the ferroelectric phase transition in PbTiO3,
including the temperature dependences of the spontaneous polarization, the heat
capacities, the permittivity tensor, and the lattice parameters. The approach
also allows parametrization of the free energy function across phase
transitions based directly on the 0 K thermodynamics data that can be obtained
from DFT calculations. We anticipate that the approach can be equally applied
to other types of critical phenomena, e.g., the superconducting phase
transition, the metal-insulator transition, and the magnetic transitions.

We derive a scheme by which to solve the Liouville equation perturbatively in
the nonlinearity, which we apply to weakly nonlinear classical field theories.
Our solution is a variant of the Prigogine diagrammatic method, and is based on
an analogy between the Liouville equation in infinite volume and scattering in
quantum mechanics, described by the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The motivation
for our work is wave turbulence: a broad class of nonlinear classical field
theories are believed to have a stationary turbulent state -- a
far-from-equilibrium state, even at weak coupling. Our method provides an
efficient way to derive properties of the weak wave turbulent state. A central
object in these studies, which is a reduction of the Liouville equation, is the
kinetic equation, which governs the occupation numbers of the modes. All
properties of wave turbulence to date are based on the kinetic equation found
at leading order in the weak nonlinearity. We explicitly obtain the kinetic
equation to next-to-leading order.

<h3>Simulating Cumulus Clouds based on Self-Organized Criticality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02580" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02580</a>
<br>
<i>J. Cheraghalizadeh, M. Luković, M. N. Najafi</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently it was shown that self-organized criticality is an important
ingredient of the dynamics of cumulus clouds (Physical Review E, 103(5),
p.052106, 2021). Here we introduce a new algorithm to simulate cumulus clouds
in two-dimensional square lattices, based on two important facts: the cohesive
energy of wet air parcels and a sandpile-type diffusion of cloud segments. The
latter is realized by considering the evaporation/condensation of air parcels
in various regions of the cloud, which enables them to diffuse to the
neighboring regions. The results stemming from this model are in excellent
agreement with the observational results reported in the above-cited paper,
where the exponents have been obtained for the two-dimensional earth-to-sky RGB
images of clouds. The exponents that are obtained at the lowest condensation
level in our model are consistent with the observational exponents. We observed
that the cloud fields that we obtain from our model are fractal, with the outer
perimeter having a fractal dimension of $D_f = 1.25 \pm 0.01$. Furthermore, the
distributions of the radius of gyration and the loop length follow a power-law
function with exponents $\tau_r = 2.3 \pm 0.1$ and $\tau_l = 2.1 \pm 0.1$,
respectively. The loop Green function is found to be logarithmic with the
radius of gyration of the loops following the observational results. The
winding angle statistic of the external perimeter of the cloud field is also
analyzed, showing an exponent in agreement with the fractal dimension, which
may serve as the conformal invariance of the system.

Computer vision techniques have immense potential for materials design
applications. In this work, we introduce an integrated and general-purpose
AtomVision library that can be used to generate, curate scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) datasets
and apply machine learning techniques. To demonstrate the applicability of this
library, we 1) generate and curate an atomistic image dataset of about 10000
materials, 2) develop and compare convolutional and graph neural network models
to classify the Bravais lattices, 3) develop fully convolutional neural network
using U-Net architecture to pixelwise classify atom vs background, 4) use
generative adversarial network for super-resolution, 5) curate a natural
language processing based image dataset using open-access arXiv dataset, and 6)
integrate the computational framework with experimental microscopy tools.

<h3>Simultaneous mapping of temperature and hydration in proton exchange  membrane of fuel cells using magnetic resonance imaging</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02589" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02589</a>
<br>
<i>Darshan Chalise, Shreyan Majumdar, David G. Cahill</i>
<br>
<br>
The efficiency of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell depends on the
mobility of protons in the PEM, which is determined by the hydration and
temperature of the membrane. While optical techniques or neutron or x-ray
scattering techniques may be used to study the inhomogeneities in hydration and
temperature in PEMs, these techniques cannot provide 3 dimensional spatial
resolution in measuring layered PEMs. Due to their ability to provide
non-invasive 3D images, spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and spin-spin
relaxation time (T2) contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of protons in
PEMs have been suggested as methods to map hydration in the fuel cells. We show
that while T1 and T2 imaging may be used to map hydration in PEMs under
isothermal conditions, proton T1 and T2 are also a function of temperature. For
PEM fuel cells, where current densities are large and thermal gradients are
expected, T1 and T2 relaxation times cannot be used for mapping hydration. The
chemical shift of the mobile proton is, however, a strong function of hydration
but not temperature. Therefore, chemical shift imaging (CSI) can be used to map
hydration. The diffusion constant of the mobile proton, which can be determined
by pulsed field gradient NMR, increases with both temperature and hydration.
Therefore, CSI followed by imaging of diffusion via pulsed field gradients can
be used for separate mappings of hydration and temperature in PEMs. Here, we
demonstrate a 16 x 16 pixel MRI mapping of hydration and temperature in Nafion
PEMs with a spatial resolution of 1 mm x 1 mm, a total scan time of 3 minutes,
a temperature resolution of 6 K, and an uncertainty in hydration within 15%.
The demonstrated mapping can be generalized for imaging exchange membranes of
any fuel cells or flow batteries.

<h3>Characterizing the Nonequilibrium Response of FeRh Thin Films using  Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02593" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02593</a>
<br>
<i>Renee M. Harton, Alejandro Ceballos, Frances Hellman</i>
<br>
<br>
Two-tint Time-Domain Thermoreflectance (TDTR) characterization of FeRh
throughout its first order antiferromagnetic (AF) to ferromagnetic (FM)
transition shows that the transient reflectance, $\Delta$R(t)/R, strongly
depends on the magnetic order of the sample. Using a probe wavelength of
approximately 783 nm, we have found that the $\Delta$R(t)/R of the AF phase
exhibits a large negative response, while the response of the FM phase is
positive. This magnetic phase sensitivity has allowed us to study the transient
response of both the AF and FM phase to the pump pulse excitation as well as
the mixed phase of the material. We have found that the AF phase exhibits a
strong transient signal which is not observed in the FM phase. A model using
linear system techniques was able to represent and analyze the behavior of the
system in each phase. The thermalization time of the electrons in the AF phase
occurred on a timescale at least twice as long as that in the FM phase. These
results indicate that the two-tint TDTR can be used to study the transient
properties of the AF and FM phase of FeRh as well as the mixed phase.

<h3>Microscopic theory of cavity-enhanced interactions of dipolaritons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02597" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02597</a>
<br>
<i>Esben R. Christensen, Arturo Camacho-Guardian, Ovidiu Cotlet, Atac Imamoglu, Michiel Wouters, Georg M. Bruun, Iacopo Carusotto</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a theoretical model for the interaction strength between a pair of
exciton-polaritons with finite and parallel static electric-dipole moments. In
stark contrast to simple perturbative arguments predicting the interaction to
be reduced due to the hybridisation with cavity photons, we find that the
strong coupling to a cavity mode leads to a drastic enhancement of the
polariton interactions as compared to bare excitons. This enhancement is caused
by the small polariton mass due to its photonic component, which increases the
kinetic cost associated with minimising the dipole-dipole repulsion.
Microscopic numerical calculations for one-dimensional geometries show that the
interaction strength for the lower polariton branch is maximal when the exciton
and the cavity mode are close to resonance, and can easily exceed
state-of-the-art cavity decay rates for realistic confinement lengths, thus
entering the polariton blockade regime. Analytical extension of our results to
two-dimensional polariton systems highlight dipolar polaritons as a most
promising solid-state platform to realize strongly interacting photonic
systems.

Transparent contact interfaces in superconductor-graphene hybrid systems are
critical for realizing superconducting quantum applications. Here, we examine
the effect of the edge-contact fabrication process on the transparency of the
superconducting aluminum-graphene junction. We show significant improvement in
the transparency of our superconductor-graphene junctions by promoting the
chemical component of the edge contact etch process. Our results compare
favorably with state-of-the-art graphene Josephson junctions. The findings of
our study contribute to advancing the fabrication knowledge of edge-contacted
superconductor-graphene junctions.

<br>
<br>
Architected materials can achieve enhanced properties compared to their plain
counterparts. Specific architecting serves as a powerful design lever to
achieve targeted behavior without changing the base material. Thus, the
connection between architected structure and resultant properties remains an
open field of great interest to many fields, from aerospace to civil to
automotive applications. Here, we focus on properties related to mechanical
compression, and design hierarchical honeycomb structures to meet specific
values of stiffness and compressive stress. To do so, we employ a combination
of techniques in a singular workflow, starting with molecular dynamics
simulation of the forward design problem, augmenting with data-driven
artificial intelligence models to address the inverse design problem, and
verifying the behavior of de novo structures with experimentation of additively
manufactured samples. We thereby demonstrate an approach for architected design
that is generalizable to multiple material properties and agnostic to the
identity of the base material.

<h3>Phonon-mediated strong coupling between a three-dimensional topological  insulator and a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic material</h3>

<br>
Van der Waals antiferromagnetic and topological insulator materials provide
powerful platforms for modern optical, electronic, and spintronic devices
applications. The interaction between an antiferromagnet (AFM) and a
topological insulator (TI), if sufficiently strong, could offer emergent hybrid
material properties that enable new functionality exceeding what is possible in
any individual material constituent. In this work, we study strong coupling
between THz excitations in a three dimensional (3D) topological insulator and a
quasi-two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic material resulting in a new
hybridized mode, namely a surface Dirac plasmon-phonon-magnon polariton. We
find that the interaction between a surface Dirac plasmon polariton in the 3D
TI and a magnon polariton in the 2D AFM is mediated by the phonon coupling in
the 3D TI material. The coupling of phonons with an electromagnetic wave
propagating in the 3D TI enhances the permittivity of the TI thin film in a way
that results in a strong correlation between the dispersion of Dirac plasmon
polaritons on the surfaces of the TI with the thickness of the TI. As a result,
the dispersion of surface Dirac plasmon polaritons in the TI can be tuned
toward resonance with the magnon polariton in the AFM material by varying the
TI's thickness, thereby enhancing the strength of the coupling between the
excitations in the two materials. The strength of this coupling, which results
in the surface Dirac plasmon-phonon-magnon polariton, can be parameterized by
the amplitude of the avoided-crossing splitting between the two polariton
branches at the magnon resonance frequency...

<h3>Superconducting diode from flux biased Josephson junction arrays</h3>

We propose a realization of the superconducting diode effect in flux biased
superconducting circuits of Josephson junctions. So far the observation of the
superconducting diode effect has been limited to rather exotic material
platforms. In theoretical proposals, it relied on a non-sinusoidal form of the
current phase relation of Josephson junctions. Here, we show how the diode
effect can be engineered in superconducting circuits without any such
requirements. The only necessary ingredients are standard sinusoidal Josephson
junctions and flux bias lines that are readily available in scalable industrial
silicon-chip based superconducting design processes.

The problem of noise-induced transitions is often associated with Hendrik
Kramers due to his seminal paper of 1940, where an archetypal example -
one-dimensional potential system subject to linear damping and weak white noise
- was considered and the quasi-stationary rate of escape over a potential
barrier was estimated for the ranges of extremely small and moderate-to-large
damping. The gap between these ranges was covered in the 80th by one of
Rashba's favourite disciples Vladimir Ivanovich Mel'nikov.
It is natural to pose a question: how does the escape rate achieve the
quasi-stationary stage? At least in case of a single potential barrier, the
answer seems to be obvious: the escape rate should smoothly and monotonously
grow from zero at the initial instant to the quasi-stationary value at
time-scales of the order of the time required for the formation of the
quasi-stationary distribution within the potential well. Such answer appeared
to be confirmed with the analytic work of Vitaly Shneidman in 1997. However our
works in the end of the 90th and in the beginning of the 2000th in
collaboration with one more Rashba's favorite disciple Valentin Ivanovich Sheka
and with Riccardo Mannella showed that, at a shorter time-scale, namely that of
the order of the period of natural oscillations in the potential well, the
escape rate growth generically occured stepwise or even in an oscillatory
manner. Analytic results were confirmed with computer simulations.
In the present paper, we review those results and provide a roadmap for the
development of the subject, in particular demonstrating that various recently
exploited experimental systems are excellent candidates for the observation of
the above non-trivial theoretical predictions and, moreover, they promise
useful applications.

We study a one-dimensional Kitaev model with uniform phase gradient pairing
term. We show that the gradient constant dramatically affects the phase
diagram, which consists of topologically trivial and nontrivial phases,
associated with Majorana edge modes. Based on the exact solution, a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-pair order parameter is introduced to
characterize the phase diagram by its value and nonanalytic behavior at phase
boundaries. We find that this order parameter obtains its maxima at the triple
critical points, at which the pairing phase gradient suppresses the
single-particle scattering process due to the coherent destructive
interference. In particular, we show that the ground state at such a point
possesses exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO), in the thermodynamic
limit. Our result provides an example of a gapless $p$-wave superconducting
ground state possessing ODLRO.

Transition of a system between two states is an important but difficult
problem in natural science. In this article we study the transition problem in
the framework of transition path ensemble. Using the overdamped Langevin
method, we introduce the path integral formulation of the transition
probability and obtain the equation for the minimum action path in the
transition path space. For the effective sampling in the transition path
ensemble, we derive a conditional overdamped Langevin equation. In two exactly
solvable models, the free particle system and the harmonic system, we present
the expression of the conditional probability density and the explicit
solutions for the conditional Langevin equation and the minimum action path.
The analytic results demonstrate the consistence of the conditional Langevin
equation with the desired probability distribution in the transition. It is
confirmed that the conditional Langevin equation is an effective tool to sample
the transition path ensemble, and the minimum action principle actually leads
to the most probable path.

Long-range ferroelectric crystalline order usually fades away as the spatial
dimension decreases, hence there are few two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics
and far fewer one-dimensional (1D) ferroelectrics. Due to the depolarization
field, low-dimensional ferroelectrics rarely possess the polarization along the
direction of reduced dimensionality. Here, using first-principles density
functional theory, we explore the structural evolution of nanoribbons of
varying widths constructed by cutting the 2D sheet of ferroelectric
$\alpha$-III$_2$IV$_3$ (III=Al, Ga, In; VI=S, Se, Te). We discover a
one-dimensional ferroelectric nanothread (1DFENT) of ultrasmall diameter with
both axial and radial polarization, potentially enabling ultra-dense data
storage with a 1D domain of just three unit cells being the functional unit.
The polarization in 1DFENT of Ga$_2$Se$_3$ exhibits an unusual piezoelectric
response: a stretching stress along the axial direction will increase both
axial and radial polarization, referred to as auxetic piezoelectric effect.
Utilizing the intrinsically flat electronic bands, we demonstrate the
coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in 1DFENT and a
counterintuitive charge-doping-induced metal-to-insulator transition. The
1DFENT with both axial and radial polarization offers a counterexample to the
Mermin--Wagner theorem in 1D and suggests a new platform for the design of
ultrahigh-density memory and the exploration of exotic states of matter.

<h3>Chiral phonons: circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy and $\textit{ab  initio}$ calculations in a chiral crystal tellurium</h3>

Recently, phonons with chirality (chiral phonons) have attracted much
attention. Chiral phonons have angular momentum and pseudo-angular momentum. In
circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy, the peak split of the $\Gamma_3$ mode
is detectable along the principal axis of a chiral crystal in backscattering
configuration. In addition, peak splitting appears when the pseudo-angular
momenta of the incident and scattered circularly polarized lights are reversed.
Until now, the chiral phonons in binary crystals were observed, while those in
unary crystals have not been observed. Here, we observe the chiral phonon in a
chiral unary crystal tellurium. The pseudo-angular momentum of the phonon is
obtained in a tellurium by the $\textit{ab initio}$ calculation. From this
calculation, we verified the conservation law of pseudo-angular momentum in
Raman scattering. From this conservation law, we determined the handedness of
the chiral crystal. We also evaluated the chirality of the phonons by a measure
having the symmetry same as electric toroidal monopole.

<h3>Valley Hall Effect and Kink States in Topolectrical Circuits</h3>

We investigate the emergence of topological valley Hall and kink states in a
two-dimensional topolectrical (TE) model as a result of broken chiral and
reflection symmetries. The TE system consists of two segments hosting distinct
topological states with opposite signs of the valley Hall index, and separated
by a heterojunction. In the practical circuit, the valley Hall index can be
flipped between the two segments by modulating the onsite potential on the
sublattice nodes of the respective segments. The presence of resistive
coupling, which introduces non-Hermiticity in the system, subsequently leads to
the emergence of gapped and gapless valley and kink states in the admittance
spectra. These topological modes can be detected electrically by the impedance
readouts of the system which can be correlated to its admittance spectra.
Finally, we confirm the robustness of the valley Hall and kink states via
realistic LTspice simulation taking into account the tolerance windows and
parasitic effects inherent in circuit components. Our study demonstrates the
applicability of TE circuit networks as a platform to realize and tune
valley-dependent and kink topological phenomena.

<h3>The absence of Ginzburg-Landau mechanism for vestigial order in the  normal phase above a two-component superconductor</h3>

<br>

A two-component superconductor may hypothetically support a vestigial order
phase above its superconducting transition temperature, with rotational or
time-reversal symmetry spontaneously broken while remain non-superconducting.
This has been suggested as an explanation to the observed normal state
nematicity of the nematic superconductor $M_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We examine the
condition for this vestigial order to occur within Ginzburg-Landau theory with
order parameter fluctuations, on both the nematic and chiral sides of the
theory. Contrary to prior theoretical results, we rule out a large portion of
parameter space for possible vestigial order. We argue that very extreme
anisotropy is one prerequisite for a stable vestigial phase, which is likely
not met in real materials.

<h3>Giant gate-tunable renormalization of spin-correlated flat-band states  and bandgap in a 2D magnetic insulator</h3>

<br>
<br>
Emergent quantum phenomena in two-dimensional van der Waal (vdW) magnets are
largely governed by the interplay between the exchange and Coulomb
interactions. The ability to tune the Coulomb interaction in such strongly
correlated materials enables the precise control of spin-correlated flat-band
states, bandgap (Eg) and unconventional magnetism, all of which are crucial for
next-generation spintronics and magnonics applications. Here, we demonstrate a
giant gate-tunable renormalization of spin-correlated flat-band states and
bandgap in magnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3) monolayers grown on graphene.
Our gate-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) studies reveal that
the inter-flat-band spacing and bandgap of CrBr3 can be continuously tuned by
120 meV and 240 meV respectively via electrostatic injection of carriers into
the hybrid CrBr3/graphene system, equivalent to the modulation of the Cr
on-site Coulomb repulsion energy by 500 meV. This can be attributed to the
self-screening of CrBr3 arising from the gate-induced carriers injected into
CrBr3, which dominates over the opposite trend from the remote screening of the
graphene substrate. Precise tuning of the spin-correlated flat-band states and
bandgap in 2D magnets via electrostatic modulation of Coulomb interactions not
only provides new strategies for optimizing the spin transport channels but
also may exert a crucial influence on the exchange energy and spin-wave gap,
which could raise the critical temperature for magnetic order.

We report herein the successful synthesis of the topological material
SnBi2Te4 in single-crystal form. Phase purity and unidirectional growth are
evident from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns acquired from a powdered sample
and a crystal flake. The crystalline morphology has also been visualized by
acquiring a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) image. The
crystal has been thoroughly characterized by means of Raman spectroscopy and X
ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The topological properties
of SnBi2Te4 have been probed through magneto-transport measurements. SnBi2Te4
has been found to exhibit a small but non-saturating magneto-resistance (MR) up
to 12 T. The low-field magnetoconductivity (MC) of SnBi2Te4 at 2 K can be well
explained through the Hikami Larkin Nagaoka (HLN) formalism, which confirms the
presence of a weak anti-localization (WAL) effect in its crystal. Moreover, the
non-trivial topological character has been evidenced through first-principles
calculations using density functional theory (DFT), with and without spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) protocols. A significant change in the bulk electronic band
structure is observed upon the inclusion of SOC parameters, signifying the
topological properties of SnBi2Te4. Its topological non-trivial character has
also been verified through the calculation of Z2 invariants and the surface
states spectrum in the (111) plane.

The material science literature contains up-to-date and comprehensive
scientific knowledge of materials. However, their content is unstructured and
diverse, resulting in a significant gap in providing sufficient information for
material design and synthesis. To this end, we used natural language processing
(NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques based on convolutional neural
networks (CNN) to discover valuable experimental-based information about
nanomaterials and synthesis methods in energy-material-related publications.
Our first system, TextMaster, extracts opinions from texts and classifies them
into challenges and opportunities, achieving 94% and 92% accuracy,
respectively. Our second system, GraphMaster, realizes data extraction of
tables and figures from publications with 98.3\% classification accuracy and
4.3% data extraction mean square error. Our results show that these systems
could assess the suitability of materials for a certain application by
evaluation of synthesis insights and case analysis with detailed references.
This work offers a fresh perspective on mining knowledge from scientific
literature, providing a wide swatch to accelerate nanomaterial research through
CNN.

<h3>Linear Response Based Theories for Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interactions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02808" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02808</a>
<br>
<i>I. V. Solovyev</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate abilities of various linear response based techniques for
extracting parameters of antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions
from the first-principles electronic structure calculations. For these
purposes, we further elaborate the idea of Sandratskii [Phys. Rev. B 96, 024450
(2017)], which states that $z$ component of the DM vector can be computed by
retaining only spin-diagonal part of the spin-orbit (SO) coupling. We start our
analysis with the magnetic force theorem (MFT), which relies on additional
approximations resulting in the linear dependence of the exchange interactions
on the response tensor, and compare it with the exact approach formulated in
terms of the inverse response. We propose the downfolding procedure
transferring the effect of these ligand spins into parameters of effective
interactions between the localized spins. These techniques are applied for the
series of CrCl$_3$ and CrI$_3$ based materials, including bulk, monolayer,
bilayer, and three-layer systems. Particularly, we discuss how the DM
interactions are induced by the inversion symmetry breaking at the surface or
by the electric field. As long as the SO interaction of the heavy ligand atoms
is taken into account in the calculations of the response tensor between the Cr
$3d$ states, the MFT appears to be a good approximation for the DM
interactions, being in contrast with the isotropic exchange, for which MFT and
the exact method provide quite a different description. Finally, we discuss the
relevance of our approach to other techniques ever proposed for calculations of
the DM interactions. Particularly, we argue that the spin-current model for the
DM interactions can be derived from the MFT based expression and is the
relativistic counterpart of the double exchange, occurring in metallic systems
in the limit of infinite exchange splitting.

<h3>Topological Hall effect induced by classical large-spin background:  $su(2)$ path-integral approach</h3>

The $su(2)$ coherent-state path-integral technique is employed to study
lattice electrons strongly coupled to a quantum spin background. In the
large-spin limit it is replaced with its classical counterpart that breaks the
time-reversal symmetry. The fermions propagating through a classical large-spin
texture may then exhibit the topological Hall effect which arises even for a
zero scalar spin chirality of the underlying spin background.

<h3>Phase behaviour of fluids in undulated nanopores</h3>

<br>
<br>
The geometry of walls forming a narrow pore may qualitatively affect the
phase behaviour of the confined fluid. Specifically, the nature of condensation
in nanopores formed of sinusoidally-shaped walls (with amplitude $A$ and period
$P$) is governed by the wall mean separation $L$ as follows. For $L>L_t$, where
$L_t$ increases with $A$, the pores exhibit standard capillary condensation
similar to planar slits. In contrast, for $L<L_t$, the condensation occurs in
two steps, such that the fluid first condenses locally via bridging transition
connecting adjacent crests of the walls, before it condenses globally. For the
marginal value of $L=L_t$, all the three phases (gas-like, bridge and
liquid-like) may coexist. We show that the locations of the phase transitions
can be described using geometric arguments leading to modified Kelvin
equations. However, for completely wet walls, to which we focus on, the phase
boundaries are shifted significantly due to the presence of wetting layers. In
order to take this into account, mesoscopic corrections to the macroscopic
theory are proposed. The resulting predictions are shown to be in a very good
agreement with a density functional theory even for molecularly narrow pores.
The limits of stability of the bridge phase, controlled by the pore geometry,
is also discussed in some detail.

Semiconductor devices are notoriously difficult to simulate at deep-cryogenic
temperatures. The lowest temperature that can be simulated today in commercial
TCAD is around 4.2 K, possibly 100 mK, while most experimental quantum science
is performed at 10 mK or lower. Besides the challenges in transport solvers,
one of the main bottlenecks is the non-convergence in the electrostatics due to
the extreme sensitivity to small variations in the potential. This article
proposes to reformulate Poisson's equation to take out this extreme sensitivity
and improve convergence. We solve the reformulated Poisson equation for a p-n
diode using an iterative Newton-Raphson scheme, demonstrating convergence for
the first time down to a record low temperature of one microkelvin using the
standard IEEE-754 arithmetic with double precision. We plot the potential
diagrams and resolve the rapid variation of the carrier densities near the
edges of the depletion layer. The main Python functions are presented in the
Appendix.

Transition metal dichalcogenides integrated within a high-quality microcavity
support well-defined exciton polaritons. While the role of intralayer excitons
in 2D polaritonics is well studied, interlayer excitons have been largely
ignored due to their weak oscillator strength. Using a microscopic and
material-realistic Wannier-Hopfield model, we demonstrate that MoS$_2$
homobilayers in a Fabry-Perot cavity support polaritons that exhibit a large
interlayer exciton contribution, while remaining visible in linear optical
spectra. Interestingly, with suitable tuning of the cavity length, the
hybridization between intra- and interlayer excitons can be 'unmixed' due to
the interaction with photons. We predict formation of polaritons where > 90% of
the total excitonic contribution is stemming from the interlayer exciton.
Furthermore, we explore the conditions on the tunneling strength and exciton
energy landscape to push this to even 100%. Despite the extremely weak
oscillator strength of the underlying interlayer exciton, optical energy can be
effectively fed into the polaritons once the critical coupling condition of
balanced radiative and scattering decay channels is met. These findings have a
wide relevance for fields ranging from nonlinear optoelectronic devices to
Bose-Einstein condensation.

<h3>Effect of local Coulomb interaction on Majorana corner modes: weak and  strong correlation limits</h3>

<br>
<i>S. V. Aksenov, A. D. Fedoseev, M. S. Shustin, A. O. Zlotnikov</i>
<br>
<br>
Here we present an analysis of the evolution of Majorana corner modes
realizing in a higher-order topological superconductor (HOTSC) on a square
lattice under the influence of local Coulomb repulsion. The HOTSC spectral
properties were considered in two regimes: when the intensities of many-body
interactions are either weak or strong. The weak regime was studied using the
mean-field approximation with self-consistent solutions carried out both in the
uniform case and taking into account of the boundary of the finite
square-shaped system. It is shown that in the uniform case the topologically
nontrivial phase on the phase diagram is widened by the Coulomb repulsion. The
boundary effect, resulting in an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the
correlators, leads to the appearance of the crossover from the symmetric
spin-independent solution to the spin-dependent one characterized by a
spontaneously broken symmetry. In the former the corner states have energies
that are determined by the overlap of the excitation wave functions localized
at the different corners. In the latter the corner excitation energy is defined
by the Coulomb repulsion intensity with a quadratic law. The crossover is a
finite size effect, i.e. the larger the system the lesser the critical value of
the Coulomb repulsion. In the strong repulsion regime we derive the effective
HOTSC Hamiltonian in the atomic representation and found a rich variety of
interactions induced by virtual processes between the lower and upper Hubbard
subbands. It is shown that Majorana corner modes still can be realized in the
limit of the infinite repulsion. Although the boundaries of the topologically
nontrivial phase are strongly renormalized by Hubbard corrections.

<h3>Statistical mechanics of continual learning: variational principle and  mean-field potential</h3>

<br>
An obstacle to artificial general intelligence is set by the continual
learning of multiple tasks of different nature. Recently, various heuristic
tricks, both from machine learning and from neuroscience angles, were proposed,
but they lack a unified theory ground. Here, we focus on the continual learning
in single-layered and multi-layered neural networks of binary weights. A
variational Bayesian learning setting is thus proposed, where the neural
network is trained in a field-space, rather than the gradient-ill-defined
discrete-weight space, and furthermore, the weight uncertainty is naturally
incorporated, and modulates the synaptic resources among tasks. From a physics
perspective, we translate the variational continual learning into the
Franz-Parisi thermodynamic potential framework, where the previous task
knowledge acts as a prior and a reference as well. Therefore, the learning
performance can be analytically studied with mean-field order parameters, whose
predictions coincide with the numerical experiments using stochastic gradient
descent methods. Our proposed principled frameworks also connect to elastic
weight consolidation, and neuroscience inspired metaplasticity, providing a
theory-grounded method for the real-world multi-task learning with deep
networks.

Control over the physical properties of materials is ubiquitously required in
many fields. One means by which this can be achieved is controlling the
internal structure of multi-component materials with an eye to enhancing
mechanical properties. Here, we focus on self-organized pattern formation in
phase separating materials, where microscopic patterns with a smooth,
continuous connection may be realized. We propose a feasible method to control
pattern formation using phase separation combined with continuous
``lamination'' of material, when material is continuously and homogeneously
layered on top of a base. We find that a random droplet pattern, a lamellar
pattern, and a cylindrical pattern are formed depending on the lamination rate
$V$. We clarify the dynamics of pattern formation, focusing on the mechanism.
This study may lead to the creation of new functional materials through
artificial pattern control.

The versatile potential of lead halide perovskites and two-dimensional
materials is merged in the Ruddlesen-Popper perovskites having outstanding
optical properties. Here, the coherent spin dynamics in Ruddlesen-Popper
(PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ perovskites are investigated by picosecond pump-probe Kerr
rotation in an external magnetic field. The Larmor spin precession of resident
electrons with a spin dephasing time of 190~ps is identified. The longitudinal
spin relaxation time in weak magnetic fields measured by the spin inertia
method is as long as 25~$\mu$s. A significant anisotropy of the electron
$g$-factor with the in-plane value of $+2.45$ and out-of-plane value of $+2.05$
is found. The exciton out-of-plane $g$-factor is measured to be of $+1.6$ by
magneto-reflectivity. This work contributes to the understanding of the
spin-dependent properties of two-dimensional perovskites and their spin
dynamics.

LaRh$_3$B$_2$ crystallizes in a layered structure where Rh atoms form a
perfect Kagome lattice. The material shows superconductivity at $T_c \approx
2.6$~K\@ and no signature for density wave instabilities. We report our
measurements of electronic transport, magnetization, and heat capacity in the
normal and superconducting state, and derive normal and superconducting
parameters. From first principles calculations of the electronic band
structure, we identify all features of Kagome bands predominantly formed by the
Rh $d$ orbitals: a flat band, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. The
calculation of the phonon dispersions and electron-phonon coupling suggests a
strong similarity between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Cs,Rb). For
LaRh$_3$B$_2$, it matches quantitatively with the observed $T_c$, supporting a
conventional phonon mediated pairing mechanism. By comparison to the
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family, we conjecture a reduced importance of electron
correlations in LaRh$_3$B$_2$.

This work presents the synthesis of SiC nanowires floating in a gas stream
through the vapour-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism using an aerosol of catalyst
nanoparticles. These conditions lead to ultrafast growth at 8.5 {\mu}m/s
(maximum of 50 {\mu}m/s), which is up to 3 orders of magnitude above
conventional substrate-based chemical vapour deposition. The high aspect ratio
of the nanowires (up to 2200) favours their entanglement and the formation of
freestanding network materials consisting entirely of SiCNWs. The floating
catalyst chemical vapour deposition growth process is rationalised through
in-situ sampling of reaction products and catalyst aerosol from the gas phase,
and thermodynamic calculations of the bulk ternary Si-C-Fe phase diagram. The
phase diagram suggests a description of the mechanistic path for the selective
growth of SiCNWs, consistent with the observation that no other types of
nanowires (Si or C) are grown by the catalyst. SiCNW growth occurs at 1130
{\deg}C, close to the calculated eutectic. According to the calculated phase
diagram, upon addition of Si and C, the Fe-rich liquid segregates a carbon
shell, and later enrichment of the liquid in Si leads to the formation of SiC.
The exceptionally fast growth rate relative to substrate-based processes is
attributed to the increased availability of precursors for incorporation into
the catalyst due to the high collision rate inherent to this new synthesis
mode.

<h3>Virasoro Generators in the Fibonacci Model Tensor Network -- Tackling  Finite Size Effects</h3>

In this paper, we extend the method implementing Virasoro operators in a
tensor network we proposed in arXiv:2205.04500 and test it on the Fibonacci
model, which is known to suffer from far more finite size effects. To pick up
the "seed" state that would flow to the stress tensor in the thermodynamic
limit, we make use of the topological idempotent that projects the transfer
matrix to the trivial sector. Combined with an optimization method, the seed
state can be identified. We demonstrate that the descendant states in the
Fibonacci model can be correctly generated with this approximate stress tensor,
giving further evidence that the method applies more generally.

<h3>Thermal effects on fracture and brittle-to-ductile transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
The fracture behavior of brittle and ductile materials can be strongly
influenced by thermal fluctuations, especially in micro- and nano-devices as
well as in rubberlike and biological materials. However, temperature effects,
in particular on the brittle-to-ductile transition, still require a deeper
theoretical investigation. As a step in this direction we propose a theory,
based on equilibrium statistical mechanics, able to describe the temperature
dependent brittle fracture and brittle-to-ductile transition in prototypical
discrete systems consisting in a lattice with breakable elements. Concerning
the brittle behavior, we obtain closed form expressions for the
temperature-dependent fracture stress and strain, representing a generalized
Griffith criterion, ultimately describing the fracture as a genuine phase
transition. With regard to the brittle-to-ductile transition, we obtain a
complex critical scenario characterized by a threshold temperature between the
two fracture regimes, an upper and a lower yield strength, and a critical
temperature corresponding to the complete breakdown.

<br>

We construct a generative probabilistic matrix model of large data based on
mixing of linear latent features distributed following Gaussian and Dirichlet
distributions. Key ingredient of our model is that we allow for statistical
dependence between the mixing coefficients, as well as latent features with a
statistically dependent structure. Latent dimensionality and correlation
patterns of the data are controlled by two model parameters. The model's data
patterns include (overlapping) clusters, sparse mixing, and constrained
(non-negative) mixing. We describe the correlation and the eigenvalue
distributions of these patterns. As a possible application of our model, we
discuss how it can be used to generate structured training data for supervised
learning.

<h3>Semimetal Contacts to Monolayer Semiconductor: Weak Metalization as an  Effective Mechanism to Schottky Barrier Lowering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03003" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03003</a>
<br>
<i>Tong Su, Yueyan Li, Qianqian Wang, Weiwei Zhao, Liemao Cao, Yee Sin Ang</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent experiment has uncovered semimetal bismuth (Bi) as an excellent
electrical contact to monolayer MoS$_2$ with ultralow contact resistance. The
contact physics of the broader semimetal/monolayer-semiconductor family beyond
Bi/MoS$_2$, however, remains largely unexplored thus far. Here we perform a
comprehensive first-principle density functional theory investigation on the
electrical contact properties between six archetypal two-dimensional (2D)
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors, i.e. MoS$_2$, WS$_2$,
MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$ and WTe$_2$, and two representative types of
semimetals, Bi and antimony (Sb). As Bi and Sb work functions energetically
aligns well with the TMDC conduction band edge, Ohmic or nearly-Ohmic $n$-type
contacts are prevalent. The interlayer distance of semimetal/TMDC contacts are
significantly larger than that of the metal/TMDC counterparts, which results in
only weak metalization of TMDC upon contact formation. Intriguingly, such weak
metalization generates semimetal-induced gap states (MIGS) that extends below
the conduction band minimum, thus offering an effective mechanism to reduce or
eliminate the $n$-type Schottky barrier height (SBH) while still preserving the
electronic structures of 2D TMDC. A modified Schottky-Mott rule that takes into
account SMIGS, interface dipole potential, and Fermi level shifting is
proposed, which provides an improved agreement with the DFT-simulated SBH. We
further show that the tunneling-specific resistivity of Sb/TMDC contacts are
generally lower than the Bi counterparts, thus indicating a better charge
injection efficiency can be achieved through Sb contacts. Our findings reveal
the promising potential of Bi and Sb as excellent companion electrode materials
for advancing 2D semiconductor device technology.

<h3>Novel superhard structures of high-pressure C-N compounds</h3>

<br>
<br>
Through machine learning force field accelerated structure search combined
with first-principles calculations, we have studied the structures of new C-N
compounds with different stoichiometric ratios, and found twelve new superhard
C-N compounds, the energies of these structures are similar to c-C3N4 , which
is possibly synthesized by high pressure experiment, the XRD of Pa-3(C4N)
P3(C4N) and C2/m(C2N) are consistent with previous experimental data and can be
used as the structural candidate. According to the macro hardness model, they
are all superhard structures, with Vickers hardness over 40GPa, even, the
hardness of Pa-3 (C4N) as high as 82.2GPa, and Pa-3 (C4N) combines high tensile
and shear resistance. Compared with the hardness calculated by macro hardness
model and bond resistance model, we obtained the relationship between the
hardness and chemical concentration of C-N compounds under the two models,
besides that, we also calculated the fracture toughness of these structures.
According to Niu's model, P2_1/c(C4N) has the best fracture toughness, which is
higher than WC in calculation, This also indicated the superior mechanical
properties of the novel C-N compounds. Moreover, for nitrogen-rich structures,
they have the potential to be used as high energy density, the energy density
of Pa-3(CN3), P-3c1 (CN4), and I-42d (CN4) are 7.076kJ/g, 7.742kJ/g and
8.045kJ/g, which is close or higher than CL-20, therefore, the C-N compounds
synthesized under high pressure have great potential as ideally superhard
materials and high energy density materials(HEDMs).

<h3>Cavity Light-Matter Entanglement through Quantum Fluctuations</h3>

<br>
<br>
The hybridization between light and matter forms the basis to achieve cavity
control over quantum materials. In this work we investigate a cavity coupled to
an XXZ quantum chain of interacting spinless fermions by numerically exact
solutions and perturbative analytical expansions. We find two important
effects: (i) Specific quantum fluctuations of the matter system play a pivotal
role in achieving entanglement between light and matter; and (ii) in turn,
light-matter entanglement is the key ingredient to modify electronic properties
by the cavity. We hypothesize that quantum fluctuations of those matter
operators to which the cavity modes couple are a general prerequisite for
light-matter entanglement in the groundstate. Implications of our findings for
light-matter-entangled phases, cavity-modified phase transitions in correlated
systems, and measurement of light-matter entanglement through Kubo response
functions are discussed.

<h3>Heat transfer in the extreme near-field regime between metallic bodies</h3>

<br>

We analyze the heat transfer between two metals separated by a vacuum gap in
the extreme near-field regime. In this cross-over regime between conduction and
radiation heat exchanges are mediated by photon, phonon and electron tunneling.
We quantify the relative contribution of these carriers with respect to both
the separation distance between the two bodies and the applied bias voltage. In
presence of a weak bias ($V_{\rm b}<100$~mV), electrons and phonons can
contribute equally to the heat transfer near contact, while the contribution of
photons becomes negligible. On the other hand, for larger bias voltages,
electrons play a dominant role. Moreover, we demonstrate that depending on the
sign of this bias, electrons can either heat up the cold body or pump heat from
it by Nottingham effect. Our results emphasize some inconsistencies in recent
experimental results about heat exchanges in extreme near-field regime and it
sets a roadmap for future experiments.

The emergence of Majorana fermion surface states has been studied in several
environments. In this paper we discuss the current-voltage characteristics of a
Majorana fermion state as a function of the voltage, temperature and magnetic
field and compare the results to experiment. Based on the agreement and
identified parameters we calculate the noise as a possible ultimate proof of
the emergence of Majorana fermions.

<br>
$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of emergent
importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. However, vital
information of the properties of complex coexisting
$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ polymorphs and low-symmetry disordered
structures is missing. In this work, we develop two types of kernel-based
machine-learning Gaussian approximation potentials (ML-GAPs) for
$\mathrm{Ga}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ with high accuracy for
$\beta$/$\kappa$/$\alpha$/$\delta$/$\gamma$ polymorphs and universal generality
for disordered structures. We release two versions of interatomic potentials in
parallel, namely soapGAP and tabGAP, for excellent accuracy and exceeding
speedup, respectively. We systematically show that both the soapGAP and tabGAP
can reproduce the structural properties of all the five polymorphs in an
exceptional agreement with ab initio results, meanwhile boost the computational
efficiency with $5\times10^{2}$ and $2\times10^{5}$ computing speed increases
compared to density functional theory, respectively. The results show that the
liquid-solid phase transition proceeds in three different stages, a "slow
transition", "fast transition" and "only Ga migration". We show that this
complex dynamics can be understood in terms of different behavior of O and Ga
sublattices in the interfacial layer.

<h3>Temporal disorder in spatiotemporal order</h3>

Time-dependent driving holds the promise of realizing dynamical phenomenon
absent in static systems. Here, we introduce a correlated random driving
protocol to realize a spatiotemporal order that cannot be achieved even by
periodic driving, thereby extending the discussion of time translation symmetry
breaking to randomly driven systems. We find a combination of temporally
disordered micro-motion with prethermal stroboscopic spatiotemporal long-range
order. This spatiotemporal order remains robust against generic perturbations,
with an algebraically long prethermal lifetime where the scaling exponent
strongly depends on the symmetry of the perturbation, which we account for
analytically.

The recently discovered topological fluctuation state provides a fascinating
new perspective on the ultrafast emergence of topology in condensed matter
systems. However, rather little is known about the physics of this state and
the origin of the topological fluctuations. Using time-resolved small-angle
x-ray scattering, we observe that topological fluctuation states appear after
laser excitation even if the final state does not host stable skyrmions.
Simulations support these findings and reveal that the fluctuations originate
from the competition between spontaneous nucleation and decay of skyrmions,
consistent with Arrhenius-like activation over a potential barrier. Stable
skyrmions can freeze out of such fluctuations when the effective temperature of
the system relaxes faster than the decay time of the skyrmions. Our results
reveal a robust scenario for the generation of topological fluctuation states,
potentially enabling their study in a wide variety of magnetic systems.

<h3>Computational Reverse-Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments  for Form Factor and Structure Factor Determination ('P(q) and S(q) CREASE')</h3>

In this paper we present an open-source machine learning (ML) accelerated
computational method to analyze small-angle scattering profiles [I(q) vs. q]
from concentrated macromolecular solutions to simultaneously obtain the form
factor P(q) (e.g., dimensions of a micelle) and structure factor S(q) (e.g.,
spatial arrangement of the micelles) without relying on analytical models. This
method builds on our recent work on Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis
for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) that has either been applied to obtain P(q)
from dilute macromolecular solutions (where S(q) ~1) or to obtain S(q) from
concentrated particle solution when the P(q) is known (e.g., sphere form
factor). This paper's newly developed CREASE that calculates P(q) and S(q),
termed as 'P(q) and S(q) CREASE' is validated by taking as input I(q) vs. q
from in silico structures of known polydisperse core(A)-shell(B) micelles in
solutions at varying concentrations and micelle-micelle aggregation. We
demonstrate how 'P(q) and S(q) CREASE' performs if given two or three of the
relevant scattering profiles - Itotal(q), IA(q), and IB(q) - as inputs; this
demonstration is meant to guide experimentalists who may choose to do
small-angle X-ray scattering (for total scattering from the micelles) and/or
small-angle neutron scattering with appropriate contrast matching to get
scattering solely from one or the other component (A or B). After validation of
'P(q) and S(q) CREASE' on in silico structures, we present our results
analyzing small-angle neutron scattering profiles from a solution of core-shell
type surfactant coated nanoparticles with varying extents of aggregation.

Electrically manipulating domain wall (DW) is at central in the field of
spintronics. Magnetic Weyl semimetal (WSM) offers an additional knob for
electric manipulation of DW by utilizing the topological DW bound states. Using
magnetic WSM material EuB6 as a prototype system, we investigate its DW bound
states combining first principles calculations and domain imaging via magnetic
force microscopy (MFM). The MFM measurements reveal that domains with
magnetization aligned along three [100] directions dominate over others under a
small magnetic field along [001] direction. Accordingly, first principles
calculations are performed based on experimentally determined DW type, which
show a robust DW bound state featuring a spectral distribution over a large
portion of the DW Brillouin zone. Such DW bound states should result in
significant amount of localized charges which can be used to drive DW motion
via the electrostatic forces exerted on the localized DW charges.

<h3>Conductivity in flat bands from the Kubo-Greenwood formula</h3>

<br>
<br>
Conductivity in a multiband system can be divided into intra- and interband
contributions, and the latter further into symmetric and antisymmetric parts.
In a flat band, intraband conductivity vanishes and the antisymmetric interband
contribution, proportional to the Berry curvature, corresponds to the anomalous
Hall effect. We investigate whether the symmetric interband conductivity,
related to the quantum metric, can be finite in the zero frequency and flat
band limit. Starting from the Kubo-Greenwood formula with a finite scattering
rate $\eta$, we show that the DC conductivity is zero in a flat band when
taking the clean limit ($\eta \rightarrow 0$). If commonly used approximations
involving derivatives of the Fermi distribution are used, finite conductivity
appears at zero temperature $T=0$, we show however that this is an artifact due
to the lack of Fermi surfaces in a (partially) flat band. We then analyze the
DC conductivity using the Kubo-Streda formula, and note similar problems at
$T=0$. The predictions of the Kubo-Greenwood formula (without the
approximation) and the Kubo-Streda formula differ significantly at low
temperatures. We illustrate the results within the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
where one expects vanishing DC conductivity in the dimerized limit as the unit
cells are disconnected. We discuss the implications of our results to previous
work which has proposed the possibility of finite flat-band DC conductivity
proportional to the quantum metric. Our results also highlight that care should
be taken when applying established transport and linear response approaches in
the flat band context, since many of them utilize the existence of a Fermi
surface and assume scattering to be weak compared to kinetic energy.

<h3>Isolated flat bands in 2D lattices based on a novel path-exchange  symmetry</h3>

<br>
<br>
The increased ability to engineer two-dimensional (2D) systems, either using
materials, photonic lattices, or cold atoms, has led to the search for 2D
structures with interesting properties. One such property is the presence of
flat bands. Typically, the presence of these requires long-ranged hoppings,
fine-tuning of nearest neighbor hoppings, or breaking time-reversal symmetry by
using a staggered flux distribution in the unit cell. We provide a prescription
based on carrying out projections from a parent system to generate different
flat band systems. We identify the conditions for maintaining the flatness and
identify a novel path-exchange symmetry in such systems that cause the flat
band to be degenerate with the other dispersive ones. Breaking this symmetry
leads to lifting the degeneracy while still preserving the flatness of the
band. This technique does not require changing the topology nor breaking
time-reversal symmetry as was suggested earlier in the literature. The
prescription also eliminates the need for any fine-tuning. Moreover, it is
shown that the subsequent projected systems inherit the precise fine-tuning
conditions that were discussed in the literature for similar systems, in order
to have and isolate a flat band. As examples, we demonstrate the use of our
prescription to arrive at the flat band conditions for popular systems like the
Kagome, the Lieb, and the Dice lattices.
