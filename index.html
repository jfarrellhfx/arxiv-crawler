We examine the hydrodynamics of systems with spontaneously broken multipolar
symmetries using a systematic effective field theory. We focus on the simplest
non-trivial setting: a system with charge and dipole symmetry, but without
momentum conservation. When no symmetries are broken, our formalism reproduces
the quartic subdiffusion ($\omega \sim -i k^4$) characteristic of `fracton
hydrodynamics' with conserved dipole moment. Our formalism also captures
spontaneous breaking of charge and/or dipole symmetry. When charge symmetry is
spontaneously broken, the hydrodynamic modes are quadratically propagating and
quartically relaxing ($\omega \sim \pm k^2 - ik^4$). When the dipole symmetry
is spontaneously broken but the charge symmetry is preserved, then we find
quadratically relaxing (diffusive) transverse modes, plus another mode which
depending on parameters may be either purely diffusive ($\omega \sim -i k^2$)
or quadratically propagating and quadratically relaxing ($\omega \sim \pm k^2
-i k^2$). Our work provides concrete predictions that may be tested in
near-term cold atom experiments, and also lays out a general framework that may
be applied to study systems with spontaneously broken multipolar symmetries.

<h3>Self-organization of primitive metabolic cycles due to non-reciprocal  interactions</h3>

We study analytically and numerically a model metabolic cycle composed of an
arbitrary number of species of catalytically active particles. Each species
converts a substrate into a product, the latter being used as the substrate by
the next species in the cycle. Through a combination of catalytic activity and
chemotactic mobility, the active particles develop effective non-reciprocal
interactions with particles belonging to neighbouring species in the cycle. We
find that such model metabolic cycles are able to self-organize through a
macroscopic instability, with a strong dependence on the number of species they
incorporate. The parity of that number has a key influence: cycles containing
an even number of species are able to minimize repulsion between their
component particles by aggregating all even-numbered species in one cluster,
and all odd-numbered species in another. Such a grouping is not possible if the
cycle contains an odd number of species, which can lead to oscillatory steady
states in the case of chasing interactions.

<h3>$synapse$: interactive support on photoemission spectroscopy measurement  and analysis for non-expert users</h3>

Photoemission spectroscopy, an experimental method based on the photoelectric
effect, is now an indispensable technique used in various fields such as
materials science, life science, medicine, and nanotechnology. However, part of
the experimental process of photoemission spectroscopy relies on experience and
intuition, which is difficult to understand for novice users. In particular,
photoemission spectroscopy experiments using high-brilliance synchrotron
radiation as a light source are not easy for novice users because the
measurements must be performed quickly and accurately as scheduled within a
limited experimental period. In addition, research on the application of
information science methods to quantum data measurement, such as photoemission
spectroscopy, is mainly aimed at the development of analysis methods, and few
attempts have been made to clarify the problems faced by users who lack
experience. In this study, we identified the problems faced by novice users of
photoemission spectroscopy, implemented a native application with functions to
solve these problems, and evaluated it qualitatively and quantitatively. This
paper describes the contents of the field study and interview survey, the
functional design and implementation of the application based on our field
study and interview survey, and the results and discussion of the evaluation
experiment.

We revisit the out-of-equilibrium physics arising during the unitary
evolution of a one-dimensional XXZ spin chain initially prepared in a domain
wall state $\vert\psi_0\rangle=\vert\dots
\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow\dots\rangle$. In absence of interactions,
we review the exact lattice calculation of several conserved quantities,
including e.g. the magnetization and the spin current profiles. At large
distances $x$ and times $t$, we show how these quantities allow for a ballistic
scaling behavior in terms of the scaling variable $\zeta= x/t$, with exactly
computable scaling functions. In such a limit of large space-time scales, we
show that the asymptotic behavior of the system is suitably captured by the
local occupation function of spinless fermionic modes, whose semi-classical
evolution in phase space is given by a Euler hydrodynamic equation. Similarly,
analytical results for the asymptotic fronts dynamics are obtained for the
interacting chain via Generalized Hydrodynamics. In the last part of the work,
we include large-scale quantum fluctuations on top of the semi-classical
hydrodynamic background in the form of a conformal field theory that lives
along the evolving Fermi contour. With this procedure, dubbed quantum
generalized hydrodynamics, it is possible to obtain exact asymptotic results
for the entanglement spreading during the melting dynamics.

<h3>Phase stability and defect studies of Mg-based Laves phases using defect  phase diagrams</h3>

Laves phases often form as secondary phases in metallic alloys and have a
significant effect on their structural properties. Thus, phase stability
studies for these chemically and structurally complex phases in addition to
mechanical behavior studies are of great interest. In this work, we use the
concept of metastable bulk phase and defect phase diagrams to augment the
understanding of the bulk phase and defect phase stability in Laves phases in
Mg-based alloys. In this way, we resolve the discrepancy between bulk phase
diagrams and experimental observations regarding the formation of Mg-rich C14
and Al-rich C15 Laves phases in MgAlCa alloys at moderate temperatures.
Moreover, the effect of the thermodynamic state of alloys on the competition
between solute-rich hcp-like planar defects and stoichiometric basal stacking
faults is clarified, which determines the brittleness of these alloys.

<h3>Time-dependent ghost-Gutzwiller non-equilibrium dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09584" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09584</a>
<br>
<i>Daniele Guerci, Massimo Capone, Nicola Lanatà</i>
<br>
<br>
We introduce the time-dependent ghost Gutzwiller approximation (td-gGA), a
non-equilibrium extension of the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (gGA), a
powerful variational approach which systematically improves on the standard
Gutzwiller method by including auxiliary degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of td-gGA by studying the quench dynamics of the single-band
Hubbard model as a function of the number of auxiliary parameters. Our results
show that td-gGA captures the relaxation of local observables, in contrast with
the time-dependent Gutzwiller method. This systematic and qualitative
improvement leads to an accuracy comparable with time-dependent Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory which comes at a much lower computational cost. These
findings suggest that td-gGA has the potential to enable extensive and accurate
theoretical investigations of multi-orbital correlated electron systems in
nonequilibrium situations, with potential applications in the field of quantum
control, Mott solar cells, and other areas where an accurate account of the
non-equilibrium properties of strongly interacting quantum systems is required.

<h3>Solute Induced Defect Phase Transformations in Mg Grain Boundaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09585" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09585</a>

The study of defect phases is important for designing nanostructured metals
and alloys. Grain boundaries (GBs) form one class of defects that directly
influence materials properties, such as deformability and strength. At the same
time, alloying can introduce GB phase transformations and can therewith alter
mechanical performance. In this work, the defect phases of a $\Sigma$7
$(12\bar{3}0)$ [0001] 21.78$^\circ$ symmetric tilt GB in hcp Mg are
investigated. Ab-initio simulations as a function of stress and temperature
(using quasi-harmonic approximation) are performed, and different types of
phase transformations are revealed. To this end, the influence of the chemical
degree of freedom on the defect phases is studied for the example of Ga
addition, using an efficient screening approach that combines empirical
potentials and accurate ab-initio calculations. By exploiting the concept of
defect phase diagrams, a phase transformation from the T to the A structural
type and as well as a systematic transition of the segregation site preference
is revealed. The results qualitatively agree well with experimental
observations from scanning transition electron microscopy. The underlying
physical mechanisms have an impact on grain-boundary engineering in metallic
alloys.

<h3>Characterisation of the strain rate sensitivity of basal, prismatic and  pyramidal slip in Zircaloy-4 using micropillar compression</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09600" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09600</a>
<br>
<i>Ning Fang, Yang Liu, Finn Giuliani, Ben Britton</i>
<br>
<br>
For polycrystalline deformation in metals such as Zircaloy-4, the slip
strength at different strain rates will control mechanical response and
strongly influence the anisotropy of plastic deformation. In this work, the
slip activity and strain rate sensitivity of the <a> basal, <a> prismatic, and
<c+a> pyramidal slip systems were explored by testing at variable strain rates
(1E-4 s^-1 and 125 s^-1) using single crystal micropillar compression tests.
These systematic experiments enabled the direct fitting of the strain rate
sensitivities of the different slip systems using a simple analytical model to
reveal that deformation will be accommodated using different slip systems
depending on the strain rate of deformation in addition to the stress state
(i.e. Schmid's law). This insight helps inform metal forming and understanding
of the mechanical performance of these engineering alloys in the extremes of
service conditions.

<h3>A simply solvable model capturing the approach to statistical  self-similarity for the diffusive coarsening of bubbles, droplets, and grains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09612" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09612</a>
<br>
<i>Anthony T. Chieco, Douglas J. Durian</i>
<br>
<br>
Aqueous foams and a wide range of related systems are believed to coarsen by
gas diffusion between neighboring domains into a statistically self-similar
scaling state, after the decay of initial transients, such that dimensionless
size and shape distributions become time independent and the average grows as a
power law. Partial integrodifferential equations for the time evolution of the
size distribution for such phase separating systems can be formulated for
arbitrary initial conditions, but these are cumbersome for analyzing data on
non-scaling state preparations. Here we show that essential features of the
approach to the scaling state can be captured by an exactly-solvable ordinary
differential equation for the evolution of the average bubble size. The key
ingredient is to characterize the the bubble size distribution approximately,
using the average size of all bubbles and the average size of the critical
bubbles, which instantaneously neither grow nor shrink. The difference between
these two averages serves as a proxy for the width of the size distribution. To
test our model, we compare with data for quasi-two dimensional dry foams
created with three different initial amounts of polydispersity. This allows us
to readily identify the critical radius from the average area of six-sided
bubbles, whose growth rate is zero by the von~Neumann law. The growth of the
average and critical radii agree quite well with exact solution, though the
most monodisperse sample crosses over to the scaling state faster than
expected. A simpler approximate solution of our model performs equally well.
Our approach is applicable to 3d foams, which we demonstrate by re-analyzing
prior data, as well as to froths of dilute droplets and to phase separation
kinetics for more general systems such as emulsions, binary mixtures, and
alloys.

<h3>Nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry of individual Fe-triazole spin crossover  nanorods</h3>

<br>
<br>
[Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) (Fe-triazole) spin crossover molecules show thermal,
electrical, and optical switching between high spin (HS) and low spin (LS)
states, making them promising candidates for molecular spintronics. The LS and
HS transitions originate from the electronic configurations of Fe(II), and are
considered to be diamagnetic and paramagnetic respectively. The Fe(II) LS state
has six paired electrons in the ground states with no interaction with the
magnetic field and a diamagnetic behavior is usually observed. While the bulk
magnetic properties of Fe-triazole compounds are widely studied by standard
magnetometry techniques their properties at the individual level are missing.
Here we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) based magnetometry to study the magnetic
properties of the Fe-triazole LS state of nanoparticle clusters and individual
nanorods of size varying from 20 to 1000 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and Raman spectroscopy are performed to determine the size of the
nanoparticles/nanorods and to confirm their respective spin state. The magnetic
field patterns produced by the nanoparticles/nanorods are imaged by NV magnetic
microscopy as a function of applied magnetic field (up to 350 mT) and
correlated with SEM and Raman. We found that in most of the nanorods the LS
state is slightly paramagnetic, explained by the surface oxidation and/or the
greater Fe(III) presence along the nanorod edges. NV measurements on the
Fe-triazole LS state nanoparticle clusters revealed both diamagnetic and
paramagnetic behavior. Our results highlight the potential of NV quantum
sensors to study the magnetic properties of spin crossover molecules and
molecular magnets.

<h3>Avalanche-Burst Invasion Percolation: Emergent Scale Invariance on  Pseudo-Critical System</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09643</a>
<br>
<i>Ronaldo Ortez, John B. Rundle</i>
<br>
<br>
As the variety of systems displaying scale invariant characteristics are
matched only by their number, it is becoming increasingly important to
understand their fundamental and universal elements. Much work has attempted to
apply 2nd order phase transition mechanics due to the emergent scale invariance
at the critical point. However for many systems, notions of phases and critical
points are both artifical and cumbersome. We characterize the critical features
of the avalanche burst invasion percolation(AIP) model since it exists as
hybrid critical system(of which many self-organized critical systems may fall
under). We find behavior strongly representative of critical systems, namely,
from the presence of a critical Fisher type distribution, $n_s(\tau, \sigma)$,
but other essential features absent like an order parameter and to a lesser
degree hyperscaling. This suggests that we do not need a full phase transition
description in order to observe scale invariant behavior, and provides a
pathway for more suitable descriptions

Numerical evidence suggests that the Random Field Ising Model loses
Parisi-Sourlas SUSY and the dimensional reduction property somewhere between 4
and 5 dimensions, while a related model of branched polymers retains these
features in any $d$. These notes give a leisurely introduction to a recent
theory, developed jointly with A. Kaviraj and E. Trevisani, which aims to
explain these facts. Based on the lectures given in Cortona and at the IHES in

<h3>Biochars at the molecular level. Part 1 -- Insights into the molecular  structures within biochars</h3>

Biochars are black carbonaceous solids produced through biomass pyrolysis
under conditions of little or no oxygen. Whilst their properties are well
studied, and their applications numerous, the underlying molecular structures
within biochars still need to be defined. This raises a substantial barrier to
the molecular modelling of biochars and has limited computational study of
these materials, despite the advantages of such techniques. In this work, we
critically assess the analytical techniques used to characterise biochars and
use this information to gain molecular-level insights into biochars' molecular
compositions and nanostructures. We focus on properties present at the
nanoscale and which provide atomic-resolution insights into the molecular
structures within these materials. Our goal is to create a holistic
understanding of biochars' chemical, physical and molecular properties and to
lay the foundation for future work focused on developing realistic molecular
models of these materials.

<h3>Local atomic stacking and symmetry in twisted graphene trilayers</h3>

Moir\'e superlattices formed from twisting trilayers of graphene are an ideal
model for studying electronic correlation, and offer several advantages over
bilayer analogues, including more robust and tunable superconductivity and a
wide range of twist angles associated with flat band formation. Atomic
reconstruction, which strongly impacts the electronic structure of twisted
graphene structures, has been suggested to play a major role in the relative
versatility of superconductivity in trilayers. Here, we exploit an
inteferometric 4D-STEM approach to image a wide range of trilayer graphene
structures. Our results unveil a considerably different model for moir\'e
lattice relaxation in trilayers than that proposed from previous measurements,
informing a thorough understanding of how reconstruction modulates the atomic
stacking symmetries crucial for establishing superconductivity and other
correlated phases in twisted graphene trilayers.

<h3>A quantitative variational phase field framework</h3>

The finite solid-liquid interface width in phase field models results in
non-equilibrium effects, including solute trapping. Prior phase field modeling
has shown that this extra degree of freedom, when compared to sharp-interface
models, results in solute trapping that is well captured when realistic
parameters, such as interface width, are employed. However, increasing the
interface width, which is desirable for computational reasons, leads to
artificially enhanced trapping thus making it difficult to model departure from
equilibrium quantitatively. In the present work, we develop a variational phase
field model with independent kinetic equations for the solid and liquid phases.
Separate kinetic equations for the phase concentrations obviate the assumption
of point wise equality of diffusion potentials, as is done in previous works.
Non-equilibrium effects such as solute trapping, drag and interface kinetics
can be introduced in a controlled manner in the present model. In addition, the
model parameters can be tuned to obtain ``experimentally-relevant" trapping
while using significantly larger interface widths than prior efforts. A
comparison with these other phase field models suggests that interface width of
about three to twenty-five times larger than current best-in-class models can
be employed depending upon the material system at hand leading to a speed-up by
a factor of $W^{(d+2)}$, where $W$ and $d$ denote the interface width and
spatial dimension, respectively. Finally the capacity to model non-equilibrium
phenomena is demonstrated by simulating oscillatory instability leading to the
formation of solute bands.

A statistical, path-dependent framework to describe time-dependent
macroscopic theories using the Principle of Maximum Caliber is presented. By
means of this procedure, it is possible to infer predictive non-equilibrium
statistical mechanical models from a variational principle, provided that the
adequate time-dependent constraints and the state of the system at some
specific times are given. The approach is exemplified by obtaining the
description of a time-dependent Brownian particle from kinetic restrictions. We
relate the predictive nature of a model to the structure of the prior
distribution that represents the state of knowledge about the system before the
dynamical constraints are considered. Non-predictive models are shown to be
possible in the presented framework and as an example, retrodictive dynamics
are obtained from the same kinetic constraints.

In a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), producing a
high-resolution image generally requires an electron beam focused to the
smallest point possible. However, the magnetic lenses used to focus the beam
are unavoidably imperfect, introducing aberrations that limit resolution.
Modern STEMs overcome this by using hardware aberration correctors comprised of
many multipole lenses, but these devices are complex, expensive, and can be
difficult to tune. We demonstrate a design for an electrostatic phase plate
that can act as an aberration corrector. The corrector is comprised of annular
segments, each of which is an independent two-terminal device that can apply a
constant or ramped phase shift to a portion of the electron beam. We show the
improvement in image resolution using an electrostatic corrector. Engineering
criteria impose that much of the beam within the probe-forming aperture be
blocked by support bars, leading to large probe tails for the corrected probe
that sample the specimen beyond the central lobe. We also show how this device
can be used to create other STEM beam profiles such as vortex beams and beams
with a high degree of phase diversity, which improve information transfer in
ptychographic reconstructions.

<br>
Tools for controlling electrically the motion of magnetic skyrmions are
important elements towards their use in spintronic devices. Here, we propose
and demonstrate the transport of skyrmions via GHz and THz electric pulses. The
method relies on using polarization textured pulses such that the skyrmion
experiences (via its inherent magnetoelectricity) the out-of-plane and in-plane
components of the pulse electric field. It is shown how the electric field
drags efficiently the skyrmion. The control of the skyrmion motion depends
solely on the amplitude of electric fields, frequency, polarization, or phase
in case two pulses are applied. Micromagnetic calculations supported by
analytic modeling and analysis indicate the experimental feasibility of the
control scheme.

Magnetic semiconductors are at the core of recent spintronics research
endeavors. Chemically doped II-VI diluted magnetic semiconductors, such as
(Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)Te, provide promising platform in this quest. However, a
detailed knowledge of the microscopic nature of magnetic ground state is
necessary for any practical application. Here, we report on the synergistic
study of (Zn$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)Te single crystals using elastic neutron
scattering measurements and density functional calculations. For the first
time, our research unveils the intrinsic properties of ferromagnetic state in
macroscopic specimen of (Zn$_{0.8}$Cr$_{0.2}$)Te. The ferromagnetism is onset
at $T_c \sim$ 290 K and remains somewhat independent to modest change in the
substitution coefficient x. We show that magnetic moments on Zn/Cr site develop
ferromagnetic correlation in a-c plane with large ordered moment of $\mu$ =
3.08 $\mu_B$. Magnetic moment across the lattice is induced via the mediation
of Te site, uncoupled to the number of dopant carriers as inferred from the
density functional calculation. Additionally, the ab-initio calculations also
reveal half-metallicity in x = 0.2 composition. These properties are highly
desirable for future spintronic applications.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate gate-tunable giant field-dependent nonreciprocal transport
(magnetochiral anisotropy) in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor $T_{\rm
d}$-MoTe$_2$ in the thin limit. Giant magnetochiral anisotropy (MCA) with a
rectification coefficient $\gamma$ = $3.1 \times 10^6$ T$^{-1}$ A$^{-1}$, is
observed at 230 mK, below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$).
This is one of the largest values reported so far and is likely attributed to
the reduced symmetry of the crystal structure. The temperature dependence of
$\gamma$ indicates that the ratchet-like motion of magnetic vortices is the
origin of the MCA, as supported by our theoretical model. For bilayer $T_{\rm
d}$-MoTe$_2$, we successfully perform gate control of the MCA and realize
threefold modulation of $\gamma$. Our experimental results provide a new route
to realizing electrically controllable superconducting rectification devices in
a single material.

<h3>Ising model on a $restricted$ scale-free network</h3>

<br>
<i>R. A. Dumer, M. Godoy</i>
<br>
<br>
The Ising model on a $restricted$ scale-free network (SFN) has been studied
employing Monte Carlo simulations. This network is described by a power-law
degree distribution in the form $P(k)~k^{-\alpha}$, and is called restricted,
because independently of the network size, we always have fixed the maximum
$k_{m}$ and a minimum $k_{0}$ degree on distribution, being that for it, we
only limit the minimum network size of the system. We calculated the
thermodynamic quantities of the system, such as, the magnetization per spin
$\textrm{m}_{\textrm{L}}$, the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{\textrm{L}}$, and
the reduced fourth-order Binder cumulant $\textrm{U}_{\textrm{L}}$, as a
function of temperature $T$ for several values of lattice size $N$ and exponent
$1\le\alpha\le5$. For the values of $\alpha$, we have obtained the finite
critical points due to we also have finite second and fourth moments in the
degree distribution, and the phase diagram was constructed for the equilibrium
states of the model in the plane $T$ versus $k_{0}$, $k_{m}$, and $\alpha$,
showing a transition between the ferromagnetic $F$ to paramagnetic $P$ phases.
Using the finite-size scaling (FSS) theory, we also have obtained the critical
exponents for the system, and a mean-field critical behavior is observed.

<br>
<br>
There are few inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reports on the
superconducting single crystals of FeAs-1111 system, even though it was first
discovered in 2008, due to the extreme difficulty in large single crystal
growth. In this paper, we have studied the low-energy spin excitations in the
optimally electron-doped CaFe$_{0.88}$Co$_{0.12}$AsF single crystals with
$T_\mathrm{c}$ = 21 K by INS. The resonance energy of the superconducting spin
resonant mode with $E_\mathrm{r}$ = 12 meV amounts to 6.6
$k_\mathrm{B}$$T_\mathrm{c}$, which constitutes the largest
$E_\mathrm{r}$/$k_\mathrm{B}$$T_\mathrm{c}$ ratio among iron-based
superconductors reported to date. The large ratio implies a strong coupling
between conduction electrons and magnetic excitations in
CaFe$_{0.88}$Co$_{0.12}$AsF. The resonance possesses a magnonlike upward
dispersion along transverse direction due to the anisotropy of spin-spin
correlation length within $ab$ plane in the normal-state, which points to a
spin fluctuation mediated sign-reversed ${s}\mathbf\pm$ wave pairing in
CaFe$_{0.88}$Co$_{0.12}$AsF.

Room-temperature superconductivity has been a long-standing goal for
scientific progress and human development. Thermodynamic stability is a
prerequisite for material synthesis and application. Here, we perform a
combination of high-throughput screening and structural search and uncover two
thermodynamically stable room-temperature superconductors, Fd-3m-Li2NaH17 and
Pm-3n-LiNa3H23, exhibiting extraordinary critical temperature of 340 K at 300
GPa and 310 K at 350 GPa, respectively. Li2NaH17 possesses the highest Tc among
all the thermodynamically stable ternary hydrides hitherto found. The dominated
H density of states at the Fermi level and the strong Fermi surface nesting are
favorable for the emergence of room-temperature superconductivity. Their
excellent superconducting properties help us understand the mechanism of
room-temperature superconductivity and find new room-temperature
superconductors. Interestingly, the structures of LiNa3H23 and Li2NaH17 equal
to the identified type-I and II clathrate geometry. Our results provide a
structural reference and theoretical guidance for later experimental structure
determination and theoretical search for high temperature superconductors.

We report on boron-related defects in the low-doped n-type (nitrogen-doped)
4H-SiC semitransparent Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) studied by minority
carrier transient spectroscopy (MCTS). An unknown concentration of boron was
introduced during chemical vapor deposition (CVD) crystal growth. Boron
incorporation was found to lead to the appearance of at least two boron-related
deep-level defects, namely, shallow (B) and deep boron (D-center), with
concentrations as high as 2 x 1015 cm-3. Even though the boron concentration
exceeded the nitrogen doping concentration by almost an order of magnitude, the
steady-state electrical characteristics of the n-type 4H-SiC SBDs did not
deteriorate.

<h3>Intrinsic and extrinsic anomalous transport properties of Heusler  ferromagnets Fe$_2$CoAl and Fe$_2$NiAl from first principles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09812" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09812</a>
<br>
<i>Xiuxian Yang, Wanxiang Feng, Xiao-Ping Li, Gui-Bin Liu, Yuriy Mokrousov, and Yugui Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, Heusler ferromagnets have been found to exhibit unconventional
anomalous electric, thermal, and thermoelectric transport properties. In this
study, we employed first-principles density functional theory calculations to
systematically investigate both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE), anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), and anomalous
thermal Hall effect (ATHE) in two Heusler ferromagnets: Fe$_2$CoAl and
Fe$_2$NiAl. Our analysis reveals that the extrinsic mechanism originating from
disorder dominates the AHE and ATHE in Fe$_2$CoAl , primarily due to the steep
band dispersions across the Fermi energy and corresponding high longitudinal
electronic conductivity. Conversely, the intrinsic Berry phase mechanism,
physically linked to nearly flat bands around the Fermi energy and gapped by
spin-orbit interaction band crossings, governs the AHE and ATHE in Fe$_2$NiAl.
With respect to ANE, both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are competing in
Fe$_2$CoAl as well as in Fe$_2$NiAl. Furthermore, Fe$_2$CoAl and Fe$_2$NiAl
exhibit tunable and remarkably pronounced anomalous transport properties. For
instance, the anomalous Nernst and anomalous thermal Hall conductivities in
Fe$_2$NiAl attain giant values of 8.29 A/Km and 1.19 W/Km, respectively, at
room temperature. To provide a useful comparison, we also thoroughly
investigated the anomalous transport properties of Co$_2$MnGa. Our findings
suggest that Heusler ferromagnets Fe$_2$CoAl and Fe$_2$NiAl are promising
candidates for spintronics and spin-caloritronics applications.

<br>
<br>
Reducing the dimensions of ferroelectric materials down to the nanoscale has
strong implications on the ferroelectric polarization pattern and on the
ability to switch the polarization. As the size of ferroelectric domains
shrinks to nanometer scale, the heterogeneity of the polarization pattern
becomes increasingly pronounced, enabling a large variety of possible polar
textures in nanocrystalline and nanocomposite materials. Critical to the
understanding of fundamental physics of such materials and hence their
applications in electronic nanodevices, is the ability to investigate their
ferroelectric polarization at the nanoscale in a non-destructive way. We show
that contact Kelvin probe force microscopy (cKPFM) combined with a k-means
response clustering algorithm enables to measure the ferroelectric response at
a mapping resolution of 8 nm. In a BaTiO3 thin film on silicon composed of
tetragonal and hexagonal nanocrystals, we determine a nanoscale lateral
distribution of discrete ferroelectric response clusters, fully consistent with
the nanostructure determined by transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, we
apply this data clustering method to the cKPFM responses measured at different
temperatures, which allows us to follow the corresponding change in
polarization pattern as the Curie temperature is approached and across the
phase transition. This work opens up perspectives for mapping complex
ferroelectric polarization textures such as curled/swirled polar textures that
can be stabilized in epitaxial heterostructures and more generally mapping the
polar domain distribution of any spatially-highly-heterogeneous ferroelectric
materials.

<br>

We theoretically study magnetic ground states of doped zigzag graphene
nanoribbons and the emergence of topological domain walls. Using the
Hartree-Fock mean-field approach and an effective continuum model, we
demonstrated that the carrier doping stabilizes a magnetic structure with
alternating antiferromagnetic domains, where the doped carriers are
accommodated in topological bound states localized at the domain wall. The
energy spectrum exhibits a Hofstadter-like fractal spectral evolution as a
function of the carrier density, where minigaps are characterized by the Chern
number associated with the adiabatic charge pump in moving domain walls. A
systematic analysis for nanoribbons with different widths revealed that the
ferromagnetic domain-wall phase emerges in relatively wide ribbons, while the
colinear domain-wall phase arises in narrower ribbons.

<br>
<br>
Rydberg excitons, the solid-state counterparts of Rydberg atoms, have sparked
considerable interest in harnessing their quantum application potentials,
whereas a major challenge is realizing their spatial confinement and
manipulation. Lately, the rise of two-dimensional moir\'e superlattices with
highly tunable periodic potentials provides a possible pathway. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate this capability through the observation of Rydberg
moir\'e excitons (XRM), which are moir\'e trapped Rydberg excitons in monolayer
semiconductor WSe2 adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene. In the strong coupling
regime, the XRM manifest as multiple energy splittings, pronounced redshift,
and narrowed linewidth in the reflectance spectra, highlighting their
charge-transfer character where electron-hole separation is enforced by the
strongly asymmetric interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our findings pave the way
for pursuing novel physics and quantum technology exploitation based on the
excitonic Rydberg states.

<br>
<i>Adele Valpreda, Jacobus M. Sturm, Andrey Yakshin, Marcelo Ackermann</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the use of Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) to characterize
buried interfaces of ultra-thin films. LEIS spectra contain depth-resolved
information in the so-called sub-surface signal. However, the exact correlation
between the sub-surface signal and the depth composition is still unknown. For
this reason, LEIS spectra so far only provided qualitative information about
buried interfaces. In this study, we investigate nm-thin films of Si-on-W and
Si-on-Mo, where we compare simulated data to LEIS spectra. We present a method
to extract depth-sensitive compositional changes -- resolving buried interfaces
-- from LEIS spectra for the first few nanometers of a thin film sample. In the
case of Si-on-Mo, the simulation of the LEIS sub-surface signal allows
obtaining a quantitative measurement of the interface profile that matches the
value determined using the LEIS layer growth profile method with an accuracy of
0.1 nm. These results pave the way to further extend the use of LEIS for the
characterization of features buried inside the first few nanometers of a
sample.

<h3>Non--adiabatic effects lead to the breakdown of the classical phonon  concept</h3>

<br>
<i>Andrea Marini</i>
<br>
<br>
The classical phonon and, more in general, the atomic trajectory concepts are
based on the assumption that the electrons follow adiabatically the atoms. Here
I extend the classical phonon definition to the non--adiabatic case and I
compare it with the result of a fully quantistic treatment. When the atomic
vibration is treated as a quantistic boson the retarded electronic response
induces a finite energy indetermination which reflects the internal phonon
structure. The classical phonon, instead, have an infinite lifetime that
corresponds to persistent atomic oscillations. This difference induces a gap
between the quantistic and classical phonon energies that increases with the
energy indetermination. This increasing gap reflects the breakdown of the
classical description and demonstrates that non--adiabatic effects can be
captured only by using a fully quantistic approach.

<br>
<i>Yue Li, Lei Wang, Junjie Li, Jincheng Wang, Zhijun Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a new phase-field formulation for the non-equilibrium interface
kinetics. The diffuse interface is considered an integral of numerous
representative volume elements (RVEs), in which there is a two-phase mixture
with two conserved and two non-conserved concentration fields. This particular
way of separating concentration fields leads to two distinct dissipative
processes besides the phase boundary migration, i.e., trans-sharp-interface
diffusion between different phases within a single RVE and
trans-diffuse-interface diffusion between different RVEs within a single phase.
A two-part mechanism is proposed to balance the driving forces and energy
dissipation for diffusionless and diffusional processes in RVEs. Moreover, the
classical interface friction and solute drag can be recovered by integrating
the diffuse interface. Compared with the sharp interface theory, the present
diffuse interface can reproduce the atomic simulated partial-drag
self-consistently in thermodynamics.

<h3>Local sign stability and its implications for spectra of sparse random  graphs and stability of ecosystems</h3>

<br>
<i>Pietro Valigi, Izaak Neri, Chiara Cammarota</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the spectral properties of sparse random graphs with different
topologies and type of interactions, and their implications on the stability of
complex systems, with particular attention to ecosystems. Specifically, we
focus on the behaviour of the leading eigenvalue in different type of random
matrices (including interaction matrices and Jacobian-like matrices), relevant
for the assessment of different types of dynamical stability. By comparing the
results on Erdos-Renyi and Husimi graphs with antagonistic or mixture
interactions, we introduce a sufficient criterion, called local sign stability,
for stability not to be affected by system size, as traditionally implied by
the complexity-stability trade-off in conventional models of random matrices.
This criterion generally holds for all graphs with locally tree-like structures
and antagonistic or unidirectional interactions. In addition, for locally sign
stable graphs, we observe that the leading eigenvalue undergoes a transition
from being real to acquiring a nonnull imaginary part, which implies a
dynamical transition from nonoscillatory to oscillatory linear response to
perturbations. Lastly, we ascertain the discontinuous nature of this
transition.

<br>
<br>
Biochars have been attracting renewed attention as economical and
environmentally friendly carbon sequestration materials with a diverse range of
applications. However, experimental developments may be limited by the lack of
molecular-level knowledge of the key interactions driving these applications.
Molecular modelling techniques, such as molecular dynamics simulations, offer a
systematic and reproducible alternative and yield atomistic insights into
physicochemical processes, allowing the identification of adsorption mechanisms
and, through this, informing and guiding experimental development. In this
work, on the basis of the critical assessment of the analytical techniques for
characterisation of biochars and collation of a large volume of experimental
data, we develop molecular models of three woody biochar materials,
representative of those produced under low-, medium-, and high-temperature
treatments. We characterise these models, validating them against experimental
data, and share them with the research community. Furthermore, we detail our
iterative approach to the design of these biochar models, discuss what we have
learned about the relationship between biochar composition and its morphology,
and finally share all of the building blocks used to create these biochar
models. With this work, we hope to speed up the uptake of molecular dynamics
simulations for the study and development of biochar materials and, to this
end, we distribute our easy-to-use surface-exposed biochar models ready for the
adsorption studies.

<h3>How Charge Carrier Exchange between Absorber and Contact influences Time  Constants in the Frequency Domain Response of Perovskite Solar Cells</h3>

<i>Sandheep Ravishankar, Zhifa Liu, Yueming Wang, Thomas Kirchartz, Uwe Rau</i>
<br>
<br>
A model is derived for the frequency- and time-domain opto-electronic
response of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that emphasizes the role of charge
carrier exchange, .i.e. extraction and injection, from (to) the perovskite
through the transport layer to (from) the collecting electrode. This process is
described by a charge carrier exchange velocity that depends on the mobility
and electric field inside the transport layer. The losses implied by this
process are modelled in an equivalent circuit model in the form of a
voltage-dependent transport layer resistance. The analysis of the model
predicts that the voltage dependence of the measured time constants allows
discriminating situations where the transport layer properties dominate the
experimental response. Application of this method to experimental impedance
spectroscopy data identifies charge extraction velocities between 1-100 cm/s at
1 sun open-circuit conditions for p-i-n PSCs with PTAA as the hole transport
layer, that corresponds to transport layer mobilities between 10^-4 - 3 x 10^-3
cm^2V^-1s^-1. The model paves the way for accurate estimation of photocurrent
and fill factor losses in PSCs caused by the low mobilities in the transport
layers, using small perturbation measurements in the time and frequency domain.

<br>
<br>
We report an {\it in-situ} scanning tunneling microscopy study of atomically
thin films of CeCoIn$_5$, a $d$-wave heavy-fermion superconductor. Both
hybridization and superconducting gaps are observed even in monolayer
CeCoIn$_5$, providing direct evidence of superconductivity of heavy
quasiparticles mediated by purely two-dimensional bosonic excitations. In these
atomically thin films, $T_c$ is suppressed to nearly half of the bulk, but is
similar to CeCoIn$_5$/YbCoIn$_5$ superlattices containing CeCoIn$_5$ layers
with the same thickness as the thin films. Remarkably, the out-of-plane upper
critical field $\mu_0H_{c2\perp}$ at zero temperature is largely enhanced from
those of bulk and superlattices. The enhanced $H_{c2\perp}$ well exceeds the
Pauli and bulk orbital limits, suggesting the possible emergence of unusual
superconductivity with parity mixing caused by the inversion symmetry breaking.

<br>
Recently we have computed the third order corrections to the ground state
energy of the arbitrarily polarized diluted gas of spin 1/2 fermions
interacting through a spin-independent repulsive two-body potential. Here we
extend this result to the gas of spin $s$ fermions - a system the Hamiltonian
of which has an accidental $SU(2s+1)$ symmetry - with arbitrary densities of
fermions having different spin projections. The corrections are computed
semi-analytically using the effective field theory approach and are
parametrized by the $s$- and $p$- wave scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_1$ and
the $s$-wave effective radius $r_0$, measurable in the low energy
fermion-fermion elastic scattering. The result is used to study the impact the
higher order corrections can have on the characteristics of the phase
transition (at zero temperature) to the ordered phase (on the emergence of the
itinerant ferromagnetism).

Exciton-polaritons resulting from the strong exciton-photon interaction
stimulate the development of novel coherent light sources with low threshold,
long range spatial, and temporal coherence to circumvent the ever increasing
energy demands of optical communications. Polaritons from bound states in the
continuum (BICs) are promising for Bose-Einstein condensation owing to their
infinite quality factors that enlarge photon lifetimes and benefit polariton
accumulations. However, BIC polariton condensation remains limited to cryogenic
temperatures ascribed to the small exciton binding energies of conventional
material platforms. Herein, we demonstrated a room-temperature BIC polaritonic
platform based on halide perovskite air-hole photonic crystals, profiting from
the non-radiative BIC states and stable excitons of cesium lead bromide. BIC
polariton condensation was achieved near the dispersion minimum that generates
directional vortex beam emission with long-range coherence. Our work provides a
significant basis for the applications of polariton condensates for integrated
photonic and topological circuits.

Excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (2L-TMDs) are
Coulomb-bound electron/hole pairs that can be viewed as broadly tunable analogs
of atomic or molecular systems. Here, we study the properties of 2L-TMD
excitons under strong electric field. To overcome the field limit, reached in
previous experiments, we developed a new organic/inorganic molecular gating
technique. Our approach allows reaching the field > 0.27 V nm-1, about twice
higher than previously available. Under this field inter and intra-layer
excitonic are brought into an energetic resonance, allowing us to discover new
emergent properties of the resulting hybridized states. First, as the result of
hybridization, intralayer excitons acquire an interlayer character. Second, the
same hybridization allows us to detect new excitonic species. Third, we observe
an ultra-strong Stark splitting of > 380 meV with exciton energies tunable over
a large range of the optical spectrum, with potential implications for
optoelectronics. Our work creates new possibilities for using strong electric
fields to unlock new physical regimes and control exciton hybridization in 2D
heterostructures and other systems.

Motivated by recent developments in measurements of electron spin resonances
of individual atoms and molecules with the scanning tunneling microscope
(ESR-STM), we study electron transport through an impurity under periodic
driving as a function of the transport parameters in a model junction. The
model consists of a single-orbital quantum impurity connected to two electrodes
via time-dependent hopping terms. The hopping terms are treated at the lowest
order in perturbation theory to recover a Lindblad-like quantum master equation
with electron transport.
As in the experiment, the ESR-STM signal is given by the variation of the
long-time DC current with the driving frequency. The density-matrix coherences
play an important role in the evaluation of the ESR-STM signal. Electron
correlation is included in our impurity mode. The charging energy $U$ has
significant influence on the spin dynamics depending on the sign and magnitude
of the applied DC bias. Our model allows direct insight into the origin of the
ESR signal from the many-body dynamics of the impurity.

The hot carrier solar cell (HCSC) concept has been proposed to overcome the
Shockley Queisser limit of a single p-n junction solar cell by harvesting
carriers before they have lost their surplus energy. A promising family of
materials for these purposes is metal halide perovskites (MHP). MHPs have
experimentally shown very long cooling times, the key requirement of a HCSC. By
using Ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) simulations we shed light on why cooling times
are found to be extended for these materials. In this manuscript, we
concentrate on the role of thermalisation in the cooling process. We specify
the role of electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions in
thermalisation and cooling, while furthermore showing how these processes
depends on several relevant material parameters, such as the dielectric
constant and the effective mass. Finally, we quantify how thermalisation can
also act as a cooling mechanism via the cold background effect. Here, we stress
the importance of a low degree of background doping in order to achieve the
observed extended cooling times. This work provides insights into the ongoing
discussion on cooling times in MHPs. In addition our results are an important
addition to the debate on whether or not tin perovskites are suitable
candidates for HCSCs.

<h3>Crossed Nonlinear Dynamical Hall Effect in Twisted Bilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Cong Chen, Dawei Zhai, Cong Xiao, Wang Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose an unconventional nonlinear dynamical Hall effect characteristic
of twisted bilayers. The joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane ac electric
fields generates Hall currents
$\boldsymbol{j}\sim\boldsymbol{\dot{E}_{\perp}}\times\boldsymbol{E}_{\parallel}$
in both sum and difference frequencies, and when the two orthogonal fields have
common frequency their phase difference controls the on/off, direction and
magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current. This novel intrinsic Hall response
has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry
connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the
twisted interlayer coupling. The effect allows a unique rectification
functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems. We
show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides
and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles.

Attaining milli-Kelvin temperatures is often a prerequisite for the study of
novel quantum phenomena and the operation of quantum devices. Adiabatic
demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) is an effective, easy and sustainable
alternative to evaporation or dilution cooling with the rare and
super-expensive $^3$He. Paramagnetic salts, traditionally used for mK-ADR,
suffer from chemical instability related to crystal water. We report synthesis,
characterization as well as low-temperature magnetization and specific heat
measurements of two new UHV compatible candidate materials NaYbP$_2$O$_7$ and
KYbP$_2$O$_7$. Utilizing the PPMS at 2 K, the ADR of sintered pellets with Ag
powder admixture starting at 5 T yields base temperatures (warm-up times) of 45
mK (55 min) and 37 mK (35 min) for NaYbP$_2$O$_7$ and KYbP$_2$O$_7$,
respectively, slightly advantageous to KBaYb(BO$_3$)$_2$ (45 mK and 40 min)
studied under similar conditions.

The stochastic block model (SBM) is widely studied as a benchmark for graph
clustering aka community detection. In practice, graph data often come with
node attributes that bear additional information about the communities.
Previous works modeled such data by considering that the node attributes are
generated from the node community memberships. In this work, motivated by a
recent surge of works in signal processing using deep neural networks as
priors, we propose to model the communities as being determined by the node
attributes rather than the opposite. We define the corresponding model; we call
it the neural-prior SBM. We propose an algorithm, stemming from statistical
physics, based on a combination of belief propagation and approximate message
passing. We analyze the performance of the algorithm as well as the
Bayes-optimal performance. We identify detectability and exact recovery phase
transitions, as well as an algorithmically hard region. The proposed model and
algorithm can be used as a benchmark for both theory and algorithms. To
illustrate this, we compare the optimal performances to the performance of
simple graph neural networks.

<h3>Rigorous Bounds on Eigenstate Thermalization</h3>

The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every
eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal
ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated
quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds
for $\textit{any}$ few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body
operators include crucial quantities in statistical mechanics, e.g., the total
magnetization, the momentum distribution, and their low-order thermal and
quantum fluctuations. Here, we identify rigorous upper and lower bounds on
$m_{\ast}$ such that $\textit{all}$ $m$-body operators with $m < m_{\ast}$
satisfy the ETH in fully chaotic systems. For arbitrary dimensional
$N$-particle systems subject to the Haar measure, we prove that there exist
$N$-independent positive constants ${\alpha}_L$ and ${\alpha}_U$ such that
${\alpha}_L \leq m_{\ast} / N \leq {\alpha}_U$ holds. The bounds ${\alpha}_L$
and ${\alpha}_U$ depend only on the spin quantum number for spin systems and
the particle-number density for Bose and Fermi systems. Thermalization of
$\textit{typical}$ systems for $\textit{any}$ few-body operators is thus
rigorously proved.

<h3>Phonon-Mediated ${\bf S}$-Wave Superconductivity in the Kagome Metal  CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ under Pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
The nature of the superconducting pairing state in the pristine phase of a
compressed kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ under pressure is studied by the
Migdal-Eliashberg formalism and density-functional theory calculations. We find
that the superconducting gap distribution driven by electron-phonon coupling is
nodeless and anisotropic. It is revealed that the hybridized V 3$d$ and Sb 5$p$
orbitals are strongly coupled to the V-V bond-stretching and V-Sb bond-bending
phonon modes, giving rise to a wide spread of superconducting gap depending on
its associated Fermi-surface sheets and momentum. Specifically, the
superconducting gaps associated with V 3$d_{xy,x^2-y^2,z^2}$ and 3$d_{xz,yz}$
orbitals are larger in their average magnitude and more widely spread compared
to that associated with the Sb 5$p_z$ orbital. Our findings demonstrate that
the superconductivity of compressed CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ can be explained by the
anisotropic multiband pairing mechanism with conventional phonon-mediated
$s$-wave symmetry, evidenced by recent experimental observations under pressure
as well as at ambient pressure.

<h3>Energetics and Dynamics of a stable Bloch point</h3>

Magnetic Bloch points (BPs) are highly confined magnetization configurations,
that often occur in transient spin dynamics processes. However, opposing
chiralities of adjacent layers for instance in a FeGe bilayer stack can
stabilize such magnetic BPs at the layer interface. These BPs configurations
are metastable and consist of two coupled vortices (one in each layer) with
same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite
sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism
potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open
question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB)
model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the
-- computationally more efficient -- micromagnetic (MM) models can be used and
still obtain robust results. We are modelling and comparing the energetics and
dynamics of a stable BP obtained using both HB and MM approaches. We find that
an MM description of a stable BP leads qualitatively to the same results as the
HB description, and that an appropriate mesh discretization plays a more
important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by
shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation
after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled
vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical
vortex, which may be also an interesting feature for fast and efficient
devices. A recent study has shown that a bilayer stack hosting BPs can be used
to retain information [1].

Microstructure--property relationships are key to effective design of
structural materials for advanced applications. Advances in computational
methods enabled modeling microstructure-sensitive properties using 3D models
(e.g., finite elements) based on microstructure representative volumes. 3D
microstructure data required as input to these models are typically obtained
from either 3D characterization experiments or digital reconstruction based on
statistics from 2D microstructure images. In this work, we present machine
learning (ML) approaches to modeling effective properties of heterogeneous
materials directly from 2D microstructure sections. To this end, we consider
statistical learning models based on spatial correlations and convolutional
neural networks as two distinct ML strategies. In both strategies, models are
trained on a dataset of synthetically generated 3D microstructures and their
properties obtained from micromechanical 3D simulations. Upon training, the
models predict properties from 2D microstructure sections. The advantage of the
presented models is that they only need 2D sections, whose experimental
acquisition is more accessible compared to 3D characterization. Furthermore,
the present models do not require digital reconstruction of 3D microstructures.

<h3>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy Study of Epitaxially Grown Fe3GeTe2 Layer  on the Topological Insulator Bi2Te3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Introducing magnetism to the surface state of topological insulators, such as
Bi2Te3, can lead to a variety of interesting phenomena such as magnetoelectric
effects, Weyl semimetal phases, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect. We use
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study a single quintuple layer (QL) of
the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) that is grown on Bi2Te3 via molecular
beam epitaxy. STM topographic images show that the FGT grows as free-standing
islands on Bi2Te3 and outwards from Bi2Te3 steps. Atomic resolution imaging
shows atomic lattices of 390 +- 10 pm for FGT and 430 +- 10 pm for Bi2Te3,
consistent with the respective bulk crystals. A moir\'e pattern is observed on
FGT regions with a periodicity of 4.3 +- 0.4 nm that can be attributed solely
to this lattice mismatch and thus indicates zero rotational misalignments.
While most of the surface is covered by a single QL of the FGT, there are small
double QL regions, as well as regions with distinct chemical terminations due
to an incomplete QL. The most common partial QL surface termination is the FeGe
layer, in which the top two atomic layers are missing. This termination has a
distinctive electronic structure and a (sqrt3 x sqrt3)R30 reconstruction
overlaid on the moir\'e pattern in STM images.

Magnetic multilayers are a promising platform for storage and logic devices
based on skyrmion spin textures, due to the large materials phase space for
tuning properties. Epitaxial superlattice structures of [Pt/Co/Cu]n thin films
were grown by molecular beam epitaxy at room temperature. Spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) of these samples was used to probe the
connection between surface structure and skyrmion morphology with nanoscale
spatial resolution. Irregular-shaped skyrmions were observed, with effective
diameters from 20-200 nm that are much larger than the nanoscale grain
structure of the surface topography. Nucleation, annihilation, and motion of
skyrmions could be driven using the stray field of the ferromagnetic tip in
repeated imaging, and spin-polarized current/voltage pulses. Our detailed
comparison of STM topography and SP-STM images shows that there are no surface
defects or inhomogeneities at length scales that could account for the range in
skyrmion sizes or variations in pinning observed in the measurements.

The coherent dynamics of a quantum mechanical two-level system passing
through an anti-crossing of two energy levels can give rise to
Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg (LZS) interference. LZS interference spectroscopy
has proven to be a fruitful tool to investigate charge noise and charge
decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Recently, bilayer graphene has
developed as a promising platform to host highly tunable QDs potentially useful
for hosting spin and valley qubits. So far, in this system no coherent
oscillations have been observed and little is known about charge noise in this
material. Here, we report coherent charge oscillations and $T_2^*$ charge
decoherence times in a bilayer graphene double QD. The charge decoherence times
are measured independently using LZS interference and photon assisted
tunneling. Both techniques yield $T_2^*$ average values in the range of 400 to
500~ps. The observation of charge coherence allows to study the origin and
spectral distribution of charge noise in future experiments.

<h3>Covariant derivatives of Berry-type quantities: Application to nonlinear  transport % in solids</h3>

The derivatives of the Berry curvature $\Omega$ and intrinsic orbital
magnetic moment $\m$ in momentum space are relevant to various problems,
including the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and magneto-transport within the
Boltzmann-equation formalism. To investigate these properties using
first-principles methods, we have developed a Wannier interpolation scheme that
evaluates the ``covariant derivatives'' of the non-Abelian $\Omega$ and $\m$
matrices for a group of bands within a specific energy range of interest.
Unlike the simple derivative, the covariant derivative does not involve
couplings within the groups and preserves the gauge covariance of the $\Omega$
and $\m$ matrices. In the simulation of nonlinear anomalous Hall conductivity,
the resulting ``Fermi-sea'' formula for the Berry curvature dipole are more
robust and converges faster with the density of the integration k-grid than the
``Fermi-surface'' formula implemented earlier. The developed methodology is
made available via the open-source code WannierBerri and we demonstrate the
efficiency of this method through first-principles calculations on trigonal
Tellurium.

We develop and test new machine learning strategies for accelerating
molecular crystal structure ranking and crystal property prediction using tools
from geometric deep learning on molecular graphs. Leveraging developments in
graph-based learning and the availability of large molecular crystal datasets,
we train models for density prediction and stability ranking which are
accurate, fast to evaluate, and applicable to molecules of widely varying size
and composition. Our density prediction model, MolXtalNet-D, achieves state of
the art performance, with lower than 2% mean absolute error on a large and
diverse test dataset. Our crystal ranking tool, MolXtalNet-S, correctly
discriminates experimental samples from synthetically generated fakes and is
further validated through analysis of the submissions to the Cambridge
Structural Database Blind Tests 5 and 6. Our new tools are computationally
cheap and flexible enough to be deployed within an existing crystal structure
prediction pipeline both to reduce the search space and score/filter crystal
candidates.

<h3>Anatomy of plasmons in generic Luttinger semimetals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10163" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10163</a>
<br>
<i>Jing Wang, Ipsita Mandal</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the parameter regimes favourable for the emergence of plasmons
in isotropic, anisotropic, and band-mass asymmetric Luttinger semimetals
(LSMs). An LSM harbours a quadratic band-crossing point (QBCP) in its
bandstructure, where the upper and lower branches of dispersion are doubly
degenrate. While a nonzero temperature ($T$) can excite particle-hole pairs
about the Fermi level due to thermal effects (even at zero doping), a finite
doping ($\mu$) sets the Fermi level away from the QBCP at any $T$, leading to a
finite Fermi surface (rather than a Fermi point). Both these conditions
naturally give rise to a finite density of states. A nonzero value of $T$ or
$\mu$ is thus a necessary condition for a plasmon to exist, as otherwise the
zero density of states at the QBCP can never lead to the appearance of this
collective mode. In addition to $T$ and $\mu$, we consider the effects of all
possible parameters like cubic anisotropy, band-mass asymmetry, and a
material-dependent parameter $X$, to numerically compute the quasiparticle
damping rate $\tau$ resulting from screened Coulomb interactions. A
well-defined sharp peak in the profile of the inelastic scattering rate
$\tau^{-1}$ signals the appearance of a plasmon. From our results, we conclude
that $X$ turns out to be a crucial tuning parameter, as higher values of $X$
assist in the emergence of plasmons. On the other hand, the features are
broadly insensitive to cubic anisotropy and band-mass asymmetry.

<h3>Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy in trigonal tellurium from first  principles</h3>

<br>
<br>
Structural chirality induces characteristic responses that change sign with
the handedness of the crystal structure. One example is electrical
magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), a change in resistivity that depends linearly
on the applied current and magnetic field. A strong eMChA was recently reported
for $p$-doped tellurium. With this motivation, we carry out an \textit{ab
initio} study of its bulk eMChA response as a function of temperature and
doping concentration. We use the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism
within the constant relaxation-time approximation to express the current
density at order $E^2B$ in terms of the energy dispersion, intrinsic magnetic
moment, and Berry curvature of conduction electrons. We find that the orbital
Zeeman coupling dominates the response, with smaller contributions coming from
the spin-Zeeman coupling and from the Berry curvature. The agreement with the
available experimental data is satisfactory.

<h3>Inequality of avalanche sizes in models of fracture</h3>

Prediction of an imminent catastrophic event in a driven disordered system is
of paramount importance from the laboratory scale controlled fracture
experiment to the largest scale of mechanical failure i.e., earthquakes. It has
been long conjectured that the statistical regularities in the energy emission
time series mirrors the health of such driven systems and hence have the
potential for predicting imminent catastrophe. Here we use the fiber bundle
model (FBM) and Random fuse model (RFM) of fracture and record the time series
of avalanche sizes. Such avalanches are necessarily very much unequal. These
inequalities in the avalanche time series play an important role in predicting
imminent failure. These inequalities are quantified through some indices,
namely the Hirsch-index h, Gini index g, and Kolkata index k that are estimated
from the Lorenz function L(p) where the p fraction of avalanche size acquires
the cumulative fraction of avalanche mass when arranged in the ascending order
of their sizes. Here we calculate these inequalities indices using the time
series of avalanche size. In the mean-field case of the FBM, we can calculate
h, g, and k analytically: these inequalities endpoints or terminal values can
be a very good indicator of imminent catastrophic failure. For non-mean field
cases, we give numerical results. These inequalities of avalanche size show
universal scaling properties near the failure point.

<h3>Comment on arXiv:2210.01114: Optical Saturation Produces Spurious  Evidence for Photoinduced Superconductivity in K$_3$C$_{60}$</h3>

<i>M. Buzzi, D. Nicoletti, E. Rowe, E. Wang, A. Cavalleri</i>
<br>
<br>
In the manuscript arXiv:2210.01114, Dodge and co-authors discuss the
influence of pump-probe profile deformations on the reconstructed
non-equilibrium optical conductivity of K$_3$C$_{60}$. They state that when
pump-induced saturation of the probe response is taken into account, the
reconstructed optical properties are not superconducting-like, as was claimed
in a number of experimental reports by our group. We show here that the
conclusion reached by Dodge et al. is unjustified. In fact, independent of the
specific model, including the problematic saturation profile proposed by the
authors, the reconstructed optical properties are those of a finite temperature
superconductor. The true fingerprint of superconductivity, which is the
$1/\omega$ divergence of the imaginary conductivity, $\sigma_{2}(\omega)$, is
retained and is virtually independent of the chosen model. The only
model-dependent feature is the degree of gapping in $\sigma_{1}(\omega)$. In
all cases the extracted optical properties reflect the presence of residual
quasiparticles, which at finite temperatures are inevitably present alongside
the superfluid.
