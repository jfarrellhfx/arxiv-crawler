<h3>Motility-Induced Pinning in Flocking System with Discrete Symmetry</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10106" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10106</a>

</p><i>Chul-Ung Woo, Jae Dong Noh</i>
<p>We report a motility-induced pinning transition in the active Ising model for
an active self-propelled particle system with discrete symmetry. This model was
known to exhibit a liquid-gas type flocking phase transition, but a recent
study reveals that the polar order is metastable due to droplet excitation.
Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that, for an
intermediate alignment interaction strength, the steady state is characterized
by traveling local domains, which renders the polar order short-ranged in both
space and time. We further demonstrate that interfaces between colliding
domains become pinned as the alignment interaction strength increases. A
resonating back-and-forth motion of individual self-propelled particles across
interfaces is identified as a mechanism for the pinning. We present an analytic
argument for the motility-induced pinning transition by incorporating the
resonance mechanism into the hydrodynamic theory. The resulting steady state
consists of a network of pinned interfaces interconnected by particle currents.
While the polar order is still short-ranged in space, the particle currents
mediated by the pinned interfaces can exhibit long-range temporal correlations.

<h3>Autonomous Engulfment of Active Colloids by Giant Lipid Vesicles</h3>

<p>The ability to design artificial micro/nanomachines able to perform
sophisticated tasks crucially depends on the understanding of their interaction
with biosystems and their compatibility with the biological environment. Here,
Janus colloids fuelled only by glucose and light were designed, which can
autonomously interact with cell-like compartments and trigger endocytosis. The
crucial role played by the far field hydrodynamic interaction arising from the
puller/pusher swimming mode and adhesion is evidenced. It is shown that a large
contact time between the active particle and the lipid membrane is required to
observe the engulfment of a particle inside a floppy giant lipid vesicle.
Active Janus colloids showing relatively small velocities and a puller type
swimming mode are able to target giant vesicles, deform their membranes and
subsequently get stably engulfed. An instability arising from the unbound
membrane segment is responsible for the transition between partial and complete
stable engulfment. These experiments shed light on the physical criteria
required for autonomous active particle engulfment in giant vesicles, which can
serve as general principles in disciplines ranging from drug delivery and
microbial infection to nanomedecine.

<h3>Attractive carbon black dispersions: structural and mechanical responses  to shear</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10262</a>

<p>The rheological behavior of colloidal dispersions is of paramount importance
in a wide range of applications, including construction materials, energy
storage systems and food industry products. These dispersions consistently
exhibit non-Newtonian behaviors, a consequence of intricate interplays
involving colloids morphology, volume fraction, and inter-particle forces.
Understanding how colloids structure under flow remains a challenge,
particularly in the presence of attractive forces leading to clusters
formation. In this study, we adopt a synergistic approach, combining rheology
with ultra small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS), to probe the flow-induced
structural transformations of attractive carbon black (CB) dispersions and
their effects on the viscosity. Our key findings can be summarized as follow.
First, testing different CB volume fractions, in the high shear rate
hydrodynamic regime, CB particles aggregate to form fractal clusters. Their
size conforms to a power law of the shear rate, $\xi_c \propto
\dot{\gamma}^{-m}$, with $m\simeq 0.5$. Second, drawing insights from the
fractal structure of clusters, we compute an effective volume fraction
$\phi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and find that microstructural models adeptly account for
the hydrodynamic stress contributions. We identify a critical shear rate
$\dot{\gamma^*}$ and a critical volume fraction $\phi_{\mathrm{eff}}^{*}$, at
which the clusters percolate to form a dynamical network.

<h3>Rapid and Robust construction of an ML-ready peak feature table from  X-ray diffraction data using Bayesian peak-top fitting</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09677" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09677</a>

<p>To advance the development of materials through data-driven scientific
methods, appropriate methods for building machine learning (ML)-ready feature
tables from measured and computed data must be established. In materials
development, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an effective technique for analysing
crystal structures and other microstructural features that have information
that can explain material properties. Therefore, the fully automated extraction
of peak features from XRD data without the bias of an analyst is a significant
challenge. This study aimed to establish an efficient and robust approach for
constructing peak feature tables that follow ML standards (ML-ready) from XRD
data. We challenge peak feature extraction in the situation where only the peak
function profile is known a priori, without knowledge of the measurement
material or crystal structure factor. We utilized Bayesian estimation to
extract peak features from XRD data and subsequently performed Bayesian
regression analysis with feature selection to predict the material property.
The proposed method focused only on the tops of peaks within localized regions
of interest (ROIs) and extracted peak features quickly and accurately. This
process facilitated the rapid extracting of major peak features from the XRD
data and the construction of an ML-ready feature table. We then applied
Bayesian linear regression to the maximum energy product $(BH)_{max}$, using
the extracted peak features as the explanatory variable. The outcomes yielded
reasonable and robust regression results. Thus, the findings of this study
indicated that \textit{004} peak height and area were important features for
predicting $(BH)_{max}$.

<h3>Extended defects as a source of phonon confinement in polycrystalline Si  and Ge films</h3>

<p>We present Raman spectroscopy of the polycrystalline Si and Ge films
deposited by molecular beam deposition on a dielectric substrate. The Raman
study has been made using lasers with different wavelengths. Structural
properties of the poly-films have been studied by XRD and TEM. The Raman
spectra are characterized by appearance of the additional wide peaks around 500
cm$^{-1}$ and 290 cm$^{-1}$ in the main vibrational bands of TO(c-Si) and
TO(c-Ge) phonons, respectively. It is shown that these peaks correspond to
scattering in grain boundary area. For the poly-Si films, both a downward shift
and an asymmetrical broadening of the vibrational band of TO(c-Si) near 520
cm$^{-1}$ are observed, whereas there is only a symmetric broadening in the
spectra of poly-Ge. The Raman line shape has been modeled within the framework
of the phonon confinement theory taking into account the sizes of coherent
scattering domains obtained using XRD. The model includes a symmetrical band
broadening observed in polycrystalline films. It is shown that confinement of
phonon propagation might be in the poly-Si films. The phonon dispersion and the
density of phonon states have been simulated using density functional theory.
It has been found that phonon confinement relates to grain boundaries rather
than other extended defects such as twins (multiple twins, twin boundaries),
the appearance of which does not lead to significant changes in phonon
dispersion and density of phonon states.

<h3>Thermal oscillations and resonance in electron-phonon interaction  process</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09684" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09684</a>
<br>
</p><i>Emad Awad, Weizhong Dai, Sergey Sobolev</i>
<p>Thermal resonance, in which the temperature amplitude attains a maximum value
(peak) in response to an external exciting frequency source, is a phenomenon
pertinent to the presence of underdamped thermal oscillations and explicit
finite-speed for the thermal wave propagation. The present work investigates
the occurrence condition for thermal resonance phenomenon during the
electron-phonon interaction process in metals based on the hyperbolic
two-temperature model. First, a sufficient condition for underdamped electron
and lattice temperature oscillations is discussed by deriving a critical
frequency (a material characteristic). It is shown that the critical frequency
of thermal waves near room temperature, during electron-phonon interactions,
may be on the order of terahertz ($10-20$ THz for Cu and Au, i.e., lying within
the terahertz gap). It is found that whenever the natural frequency of metal
temperature exceeds this frequency threshold, the temperature oscillations are
of underdamped type. However, this condition is not necessary, since there is a
small frequency domain, below this threshold, in which the underdamped thermal
wave solution is available but not effective. Otherwise, the critical damping
and the overdamping conditions of the temperature waves are determined
numerically for a sample of pure metals. The thermal resonance conditions in
both electron and lattice temperatures are investigated. The occurrence of
resonance in both electron and lattice temperature is conditional on violating
two distinct critical values of frequencies. When the natural frequency of the
system becomes larger than these two critical values, an applied frequency
equal to such a natural frequency can drive both electron and lattice
temperatures to resonate together with different amplitudes and behaviors.
However, the electron temperature resonates earlier than the lattice
temperature.

<h3>A space-time gauge theory for modeling ductile damage and its NOSB  peridynamic implementation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09685" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09685</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sanjeev Kumar</i>
<p>Local translational and scaling symmetries in space-time is exploited for
modelling ductile damage in metals and alloys over wide ranges of strain rate
and temperature. The invariant energy density corresponding to the ductile
deformation is constructed through the gauge invariant curvature tensor by
imposing the Weyl like condition. The energetics of the plastic deformation is
brought in through the gauge compensating field emerged due to local
translation. Invariance of the energy density under the local action of
translation and scaling is preserved through minimally replaced space-time
gauge covariant operators. Minimal replacement introduces two non-trivial gauge
compensating fields pertaining to local translation and scaling. These are used
to describe ductile damage, including plastic flow and micro-crack evolution in
the material. A space-time pseudo-Riemannian metric is used to lay out the
kinematics in a finite-deformation setting. Recognizing the available insights
in classical theories of viscoplasticity, we also establish a correspondence of
the gauge compensating field due to spatial translation with Kr\"{o}ner's
multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. Thermodynamically
consistent coupling between viscoplasticity and ductile damage is ensured
through an appropriate degradation function. Non-ordinary state-based (NOSB)
peridynamics (PD) discretization of the model is used for numerical
implementation. The model's viability is tested in reproducing a few
experimentally known facts, viz., strain rate locking in the stress-strain
response, whose origin is traced to a nonlinear microscopic inertia term
arising out of the space-time translation symmetry. Finally, we solved 2D and
axisymmetric deformation problems for qualitatively validating the model's
viability. NOSB peridynamics axisymmetric formulation in finite deformation
setup is also presented.

<h3>Phonon Linewidths in Twisted Bilayer Graphene near Magic Angle</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09692" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09692</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shinjan Mandal, Indrajit Maity, H. R. Krishnamurthy, Manish Jain</i>
<p>We present a computational study of the phonon linewidths in twisted bilayer
graphene arising from electron-phonon interactions and anharmonic effects. The
electronic structure is calculated using distance-dependent transfer integrals
based on the atomistic Slater-Koster tight-binding formalism. Furthermore,
electron-electron interactions are treated at the Hartree level. The force
constants for the phonon calculations are generated from classical force
fields. These ingredients are used to calculate the phonon linewidths arising
from electron-phonon interactions. Additionally, we account for the effects of
phonon-phonon interactions on the linewidths by computing the mode-projected
velocity autocorrelation function from classical molecular dynamics. Our
findings show that both electron-phonon and anharmonic effects have a
significant impact on the linewidth of the Raman active G mode near the magic
angle. We predict a moir\'e potential induced splitting of this mode, which
arises due to contributions from high symmetry stacking regions.

<h3>Linear-in-temperature resistivity and Planckian dissipation arise in a  stochastic quantization model of Cooper pairs</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09710" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09710</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xiao-Song Wang</i>
<p>We suppose that a Cooper pair (CP) will experience a damping force exerted by
the condensed matter. A Langevin equation of a CP in two dimensional condensed
matter is established. Following a method similar to Nelson's stochastic
mechanics, generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation of a CP in condensed matter is
derived. If the CPs move with a constant velocity, then the corresponding
direct current (DC) electrical conductivity can be calculated. Therefore, a
Drude like formula of resistivity of CPs is derived. We suppose that the
damping coefficient of CPs in two dimensional cuprate superconductors is a
linear function of temperature. Then the resistivity and scattering rate of CPs
turn out to be also linear-in-temperature. The origin of linear-in-temperature
resistivity and Planckian dissipation in cuprate superconductors may be the
linear temperature dependence of the damping coefficient of CPs.

<h3>Perturbative description of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the Hubbard  model via unitary transformation and classical spins</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kirill Alpin</i>
<p>A unitary transformation is applied to the Hubbard model, which maps the
Hubbard interaction to a single particle term. The resulting Hamiltonian
consists of unconstrained fermions, which is then mapped to a Hamiltonian of
spinless fermions coupled to pseudospins. The fermions are integrated out using
second order perturbation theory in $1/U$, resulting in an effective spin
Hamiltonian. An order parameter is identified, stabilizing d-wave
superconductivity. The groundstate energy of classical spin configurations is
minimized at a finite value of this order parameter after a critical chemical
potential, resulting in d-wave superconductivity at non-zero doping. This
suggests, that the onset of high-$T_c$ superconductivity is governed by the
groundstate of a classical spin system.

<h3>Phase determination with and without deep learning</h3>

<p>Detection of phase transitions is a critical task in statistical physics,
traditionally pursued through analytic methods and direct numerical
simulations. Recently, machine-learning techniques have emerged as promising
tools in this context, with a particular focus on supervised and unsupervised
learning methods, along with non-learning approaches. In this work, we study
the performance of unsupervised learning in detecting phase transitions in the
$J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. The model is chosen due to its
simplicity and complexity, thus providing an understanding of the application
of machine-learning techniques in both straightforward and challenging
scenarios. We propose a simple method based on a direct comparison of
configurations. The reconstruction error, defined as the mean-squared distance
between two configurations, is used to determine the critical temperatures
($T_c$). The results from the comparison of configurations are contrasted with
that of the configurations generated by variational autoencoders. Our findings
highlight that for certain systems, a simpler method can yield results
comparable to more complex neural networks. This work contributes to the
broader understanding of machine-learning applications in statistical physics
and introduces an efficient approach to the detection of phase transitions
using machine determination techniques.

<h3>Adapting OC20-trained EquiformerV2 Models for High-Entropy Materials</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09811</a>
<br>
</p><i>Christian M. Clausen, Jan Rossmeisl, Zachary W. Ulissi</i>
<p>Computational high-throughput studies, especially in research on high-entropy
materials and catalysts, are hampered by high-dimensional composition spaces
and myriad structural microstates. They present bottlenecks to the conventional
use of density functional theory calculations, and consequently, the use of
machine-learned potentials is becoming increasingly prevalent in atomic
structure simulations. In this communication, we show the results of adjusting
and fine-tuning the pretrained EquiformerV2 model from the Open Catalyst
Project to infer adsorption energies of *OH and *O on the out-of-domain
high-entropy alloy Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. By applying an energy filter based on the
local environment of the binding site the zero-shot inference is markedly
improved and through few-shot fine-tuning the model yields state-of-the-art
accuracy. It is also found that EquiformerV2, assuming the role of general
machine learning potential, is able to inform a smaller, more focused direct
inference model. This knowledge distillation setup boosts performance on
complex binding sites. Collectively, this shows that foundational knowledge
learned from ordered intermetallic structures, can be extrapolated to the
highly disordered structures of solid-solutions. With the vastly accelerated
computational throughput of these models, hitherto infeasible research in the
high-entropy material space is now readily accessible.

<h3>Layer buckling and absence of superconductivity in LaNiO2</h3>

<br>
</p><i>S. Rathnayaka, S. Yano, K. Kawashima, J. Akimitsu, C. M. Brown, J. Neuefeind, D. Louca</i>
<p>The recent observation of unconventional superconductivity in thin films of
LaNiO2 (critical temperature, Tc~10 K) and in bulk single crystals of La3Ni2O7
(327) under pressure (Tc~80 K), has brought to light a long sought-after class
of superconducting nickelates. Through structural measurements in the
327-system, it was shown that the absence of superconductivity is related to
bending of the O-Ni-O bonds. Similarly, the bond bending may be linked to the
absence of superconductivity in bulk LaNiO2. Neutron diffraction was used on
bulk non-superconducting La(1-x)Sr(x)NiO(2) samples to show that the layers are
naturally buckled, creating a Ni-O-Ni bond angle of 177 at 2 K and ambient
pressure. The buckling angle increases to 170 on warming to room temperature.
Furthermore, a broad paramagnetic continuum is observed that decreases in
intensity on cooling from room temperature signaling a possible transition to a
coherent state. However, no antiferromagnetic (AFM) peaks are detected,
although enhancement of ferromagnetic (FM) correlations cannot be excluded.

<p>The Kitaev interaction, found in candidate materials such as
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, occurs through the metal ($M$)-ligand ($X$)-metal ($M$)
paths of the edge-sharing octahedra because the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
on the metal atoms activates directional spin interactions. Here, we show that
even in $3d$ transition-metal compounds, where the SOC of the metal atom is
negligible, heavy ligands can induce bond-dependent Kitaev interactions. In
this work, we take as an example the $3d$ transition-metal chalcogenophosphate
NiPSe$_3$ and show that the key is found in the presence of a sizable SOC on
the Se $p$ orbital, one which mediates the super-exchange between the
nearest-neighbor Ni sites. Our study provides a pathway for engineering
enhanced Kitaev interactions through the interplay of SOC strength, lattice
distortions, and chemical substitutions.

<h3>Fermi Liquid near a q=0 Charge Quantum Critical Point</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09835" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09835</a>
<br>
</p><i>R. David Mayrhofer, Peter Wölfle, Andrey V. Chubukov</i>
<p>We analyze the quasiparticle interaction function (the fully dressed and
antisymmetrized interaction between fermions) for a two-dimensional Fermi
liquid at zero temperature close to a q=0 charge quantum critical point (QCP)
in the $s-$wave channel. By the Ward identities, this vertex function must be
related to quasiparticle residue $Z$, which can be obtained independently from
the fermionic self-energy. We show that to satisfy these Ward identities, one
needs to go beyond the standard diagrammatic formulation of Fermi liquid theory
and include series of additional contributions to the vertex function. These
contributions are forbidden in a conventional Fermi liquid, but do emerge near
a QCP, where the effective 4-fermion interaction is mediated by a soft
dynamical boson. We demonstrate explicitly that including these terms restores
the Ward identity. We also discuss the role of Aslamazov-Larkin-type diagrams
for the vertex function. Our analysis is built on works on the vertex function
near an antiferromagnetic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045108 (2014)] and a d-wave
charge-nematic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 81, 045110 (2010)]. We show that for $s-$wave
charge QCP (the one leading to phase separation), the analysis is more
straightforward. We also discuss the structure of the Landau function in a
critical Fermi liquid near a QCP.

<p>N-heterotriangulenes (N-HTAs) represent a class of functional molecules with
high potential for optoelectronic materials, for example as electron donating
compounds in donor/acceptor (D/A) systems. The capability of two different
N-HTAs, N-HTA 550 and N-HTA 557, the latter containing an additional 7-membered
ring, to act as electron donors at interfaces with strong
tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ and F4TCNQ) acceptors is studied using
high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy in combination with
state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations. For TCNQ/N-HTA bilayer systems
adsorbed on Au(111) Low-energy (< 2.5 eV) electronic transitions which are
attributed to charge transfer (CT) states for all four D/A combinations are
identified. Based on substantial quantum chemical calculations a generation of
ground state CT complexes is excluded. Instead, CT in the excited state, in
which an electron-stimulated CT from the N-HTAs to TCNQs is the underlying
process, is proposed. The energies of the CT states are determined by the
values of the ionization potential and electron affinity of the involved donor
and acceptor.

<h3>Dark versus blocking states in electronic transport: a Lee-Yang zero  analysis of full counting statistics</h3>

</p><i>Johann Zöllner, Philipp Stegmann, Jürgen König, Eric Kleinherbers</i>
<p>Electronic transport through nanostructures can be suppressed by coherent
population trapping, in which quantum coherence leads to a dark state that
decouples from the drain electrode. Finite transport, then, relies on
decoherence of the dark state. An alternative scenario for reduced transport is
weak coupling of a state, referred to as a blocking state, to the drain. This
raises the question of whether and how these two scenarios can be distinguished
in the transport features. For the example of electron transport through a
carbon nanotube, we identify regimes, in which this distinction is possible by
analyzing the full counting statistics in terms of Lee-Yang zeros and factorial
cumulants.

<p>Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, a recently discovered van der Waals ferromagnet, demonstrates
intrinsic ferromagnetism above room temperature, necessitating a comprehensive
investigation of the microscopic origins of its high Curie temperature
($\textit{T}$$_C$). In this study, we reveal the electronic structure of
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ in its ferromagnetic ground state using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our
results establish a consistent correspondence between the measured band
structure and theoretical calculations, underscoring the significant
contributions of the Heisenberg exchange interaction ($\textit{J}$$_{ex}$) and
magnetic anisotropy energy to the development of the high-$\textit{T}$$_C$
ferromagnetic ordering in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. Intriguingly, we observe substantial
modifications to these crucial driving factors through doping, which we
attribute to alterations in multiple spin-splitting bands near the Fermi level.
These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying electronic
structure and its correlation with the emergence of high-$\textit{T}$$_C$
ferromagnetic ordering in Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$.

<p>Bridged triarylamines, so-called N-heterotriangulenes (N-HTAs) are promising
organic semiconductors for applications in optoelectronic devices. Thereby the
electronic structure at organic/metal interfaces and within thin films as well
as the electronically excited states dynamics after optical excitation is
essential for the performance of organic-molecule-based devices. Here, we
investigated the energy level alignment and the excited state dynamics of a
N-HTA derivative adsorbed on Au(111) by means of energy- and time-resolved
two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. We quantitatively determined the
energetic positions of several occupied and unoccupied molecular (transport
levels) and excitonic states (optical gap) in detail. A transport gap of 3.20
eV and an optical gap of 2.58 eV is determined, resulting in an exciton binding
energy of 0.62 eV. With the first time-resolved investigation on a N-HTA
compound we gained insights into the exciton dynamics and resolved processes on
the femtosecond to picosecond timescale.

particular, we clarify the nature of the transition region between the spiral
and the stripe phase. Complementing previous [Phys. Rev. B 108, 035139 (2023)]
real-space Hartree-Fock calculations on large finite lattices, we solve the
mean-field equations for coplanar unidirectional magnetic order directly in the
thermodynamic limit, and we determine the nature of the magnetic states right
below the mean-field critical temperature $T^*$ by a Landau free energy
analysis. While the magnetic order for filling factors $n \geq 1$ is always of
N\'eel type, for $n \leq 1$ the following sequence of magnetic states is found
as a function of increasing hole-doping: N\'eel, planar circular spiral,
multi-spiral, and collinear spin-charge stripe states. Multi-spiral states are
superpositions of several spirals with distinct wave vectors, and lead to
concomitant charge order. We finally point out that nematic and charge orders
inherited from the magnetic order can survive even in the presence of
fluctuations, and we present a corresponding qualitative phase diagram.

<h3>The Role of Interfacial Morphology in Cu2O/TiO2 and Band Bending:  Insights from Density Functional Theory</h3>

<p>Photocatalysis, a promising solution for environmental challenges, relies on
the generation and utilization of photogenerated charge carriers within
photocatalysts. However, recombination of these carriers often limits
efficiency. Heterostructures, especially Cu2O/TiO2, have emerged as effective
solutions to enhance charge separation. This study systematically explores the
effect of interfacial morphologies on the band bending within Cu2O/TiO2 anatase
heterostructures, employing density functional theory (DFT). Through this
study, eight distinct interfaces are identified and analyzed, revealing a
consistent staggered-type band alignment. Despite variations in band edge
positions, a systematic charge transfer from Cu2O to TiO2 is observed across
all interfaces. The proposed band bending configurations would suggest enhanced
charge separation and photocatalytic activity under ultraviolet illumination
due to a Z-scheme configuration. This theoretical investigation provides
valuable insights into the interplay between interfacial morphology, band
bending, and charge transfer, for advancing the understanding of fundamental
electronic mechanisms in heterostructures.

<h3>Role of many phonon modes on the high-temperature linear-in-$T$  electronic resistivity</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Sankar Das Sarma, Yi-Ting Tu</i>
<p>We theoretically consider the possibility that phonons may be playing a role
in the observed linear-in-$T$ resistivity in cuprates by focusing on the
obvious question: How can phonon scattering be consistent with a linear-in-$T$
resistivity with a constant slope given that cuprates have many phonon modes
with different energies and electron-phonon couplings (e.g. 21 phonon modes for
LSCO)? We show using an arbitrarily large number of independent phonon modes
that, within a model Boltzmann transport theory, the emergent high-$T$
linear-in-$T$ resistivity manifests an approximately constant slope independent
of the number of phonon modes except in some fine-tuned narrow temperature
regimes. We also comment on the quantitative magnitude of the linear-in-$T$
resistivity in cuprates pointing out the constraints on the effective
electron-phonon coupling necessary to produce the observed resistivity.

<p>The interaction between free electrons and nanoscale optical fields has
emerged as a unique platform to investigate ultrafast processes in matter and
explore fundamental quantum phenomena. In particular, optically modulated
electrons are employed in ultrafast electron microscopy as noninvasive probes
that push the limits of spatiotemporal and spectral resolution down to the
picometer--attosecond--microelectronvolt range. Electron kinetic energies well
above the involved photon energies are commonly employed, rendering the
electron--light coupling efficiency low and, thus, only providing limited
access to the wealth of quantum nonlinear phenomena underlying the dynamical
response of nanostructures. Here, we theoretically investigate electron--light
interactions when photons and electrons have comparable energies, revealing
strong quantum and recoil effects that include a nonvanishing coupling of
surface-scattered electrons to plane waves of light, inelastic electron
backscattering from localized optical fields, and strong electron--light
coupling under grazing electron diffraction by an illuminated crystal surface.
Our results open new vistas in electron--light--matter interactions with
promising applications in ultrafast electron microscopy.

<h3>Electron screening and strength of long-range Coulomb interactions in  phosphorene: From bulk to nanoribbon</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09908" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09908</a>
<br>
</p><i>Farshad Bagherpour, Saeed Mahdavifar, Elham Hosseini Lapasar, Hanif Hadipour</i>
<p>Experimental observations of anisotropic tightly bound excitons in black
phosphorene, and correlated phenomena such as room temperature magnetically
active edges in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), sparked discussions on the
controversial screening of the Coulomb interaction in phosphorene-based
materials. In this way, we investigate the first-principles electronic
screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction in phosphorene from bulk to
nanoribbon by employing ab initio calculations in conjunction with the
constrained random-phase approximation. The bands near Fermi energy (E_F) are
predominantly pz orbital characters, and due to the puckering, they are not
well separated from the other bands with s, px, and specially py characters.
This proximity in energy levels increases the contribution of px/py
$\rightarrow$ pz transitions to the polarization function and significantly
alters the Coulomb parameters. In semiconducting systems, the on-site Coulomb
interaction values (Hubbard U) range from 4.1 to 6.5 eV and depend on the
correlated subspace, electronic structure, nanoribbon's width, and edge
passivation. Our long-range interaction has revealed a non-conventional
screening in semiconducting nanoribbons. We have discovered that screening
actually enhances the electron-hole interaction for separations larger than a
critical distance r_c, which is contrary to what was previously seen in
conventional semiconductors. In unpassivated zigzag nanoribbons, due to a
metallic screening channel stemming from quasi-flat edge bands at E_F, we find
U/W_b > 1 (the bandwidth W_b) and large gradient of inter-site Coulomb
interactions, making them correlated materials. We have investigated the
instability of the paramagnetic state of bare ZPNRs toward ferromagnetism using
a Stoner model based on the calculated Hubbard U parameters.

<h3>Thermal relaxation of strain and twist in ferroelectric hexagonal boron  nitride moiré interfaces</h3>

<p>New properties can arise at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces hosting a moir\'e
pattern generated by interlayer twist and strain. However, achieving precise
control of interlayer twist/strain remains an ongoing challenge in vdW
heterostructure assembly, and even subtle variation in these structural
parameters can create significant changes in the moir\'e period and emergent
properties. Characterizing the rate of interlayer twist/strain relaxation
during thermal annealing is critical to establish a thermal budget for vdW
heterostructure construction and may provide a route to improve the homogeneity
of the interface or to control its final state. Here, we characterize the
spatial and temporal dependence of interfacial twist and strain relaxation in
marginally-twisted hBN/hBN interfaces heated under conditions relevant to vdW
heterostructure assembly and typical sample annealing. We find that the
ferroelectric hBN/hBN moir\'e relaxes minimally during annealing in air at
typical assembly temperatures of 170{\deg}C. However, at 400{\deg}C, twist
angle relaxes significantly, accompanied by a decrease in spatial uniformity.
Uniaxial heterostrain initially increases and then decreases over time,
becoming increasingly non-uniform in direction. Structural irregularities such
as step edges, contamination bubbles, or contact with the underlying substrate
result in local inhomogeneity in the rate of relaxation.

<p>Here we study nonmonotonic features which appear both in magnetoresistivity
and anomalous Hall resistivity during the simple magnetization process, by
systematically measuring type-II magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ films
over a wide carrier density range. We find that a positive magnetoresistivity
hump can be explained as manifestation of a field-linear term in the
generalized magnetoconductivity formula including the Berry curvature. As also
confirmed by model calculation, the term can be negative and pronounced near
the Weyl point energy in the case that the Weyl cones are heavily tilted. Our
findings demonstrate extensive effects of the Berry curvature on various
magnetotransport in magnetic Weyl semimetals beyond the anomalous Hall effect.

<br>
</p><i>Étienne Lantagne-Hurtubise, Iliya Esin, Gil Refael, Frederik Nathan</i>
<p>We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency
conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two
monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate
tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly
couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental
realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family,
we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale
applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent
cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative
losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net
amplification.

<p>Two-dimensional (2D) Fe-chalcogenides have emerged with rich structures,
magnetisms and superconductivities, which sparked the growing research
interests in the torturous transition mechanism and tunable properties for
their potential applications in nanoelectronics. Uniaxial strain can produce a
lattice distortion to study symmetry breaking induced exotic properties in 2D
magnets. Herein, the anomalous Raman spectrum of 2D tetragonal (t-) and
hexagonal (h-) FeTe were systematically investigated via uniaxial strain
engineering strategy. We found that both t- and h-FeTe keep the structural
stability under different uniaxial tensile or compressive strain up to +/-
0.4%. Intriguingly, the lattice vibrations along both in-plane and out-of-plane
directions exceptionally hardened (softened) under tensile (compressive)
strain, distinguished from the behaviors of many conventional 2D systems.
Furthermore, the difference in thickness-dependent strain effect can be well
explained by their structural discrepancy between two polymorphs of FeTe. Our
results could provide a unique platform to elaborate the vibrational properties
of many novel 2D materials.

<h3>Polarized Charge Dynamics of a Novel Charge Density Wave in Kagome FeGe</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shaohui Yi, Zhiyu Liao, Qi Wang, Haiyang Ma, Jianpeng Liu, Xiaokun Teng, Pengcheng Dai, Yaomin Dai, Jianzhou Zhao, Yanpeng Qi, Bing Xu, Xianggang Qiu</i>
<p>We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a
charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using
polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal a
pronounced optical anisotropy, various excitations associated with flat bands
and van Hove singularities (VHSs), and a moderate level of electronic
correlations. Notably, there are two types of remarkable spectral weight (SW)
redistributions for above and below $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$. The former involves a
transfer between incoherent and coherent excitations driven by the magnetic
splitting-induced elevation of flat bands. The latter manifests itself as a
sudden change of SW from low to high energies for both $a$ and $c$ directions,
suggesting a first-order transition and the three-dimensional nature of CDW.
These anomalies in SW significantly differ from those observed in other kagome
metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs results in a pronounced
CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by the jump of VHSs
relative to the Fermi energy via a first-order structural transition involving
large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay
among structure, magnetism, electronic correlations, and charge order in FeGe,
offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in
kagome systems.

<h3>Anomalous external-magnetic-field dependence of dephasing in a spin bath</h3>

<p>We theoretically investigate the dephasing of a central spin-1 model. An
interesting mechanism of spin decoherence is found with this model, namely {\em
hyperfine mediated spectral diffusion}. This mechanism contains both the
features of dipolar interactions induced spectral diffusion and hyperfine
mediated interactions. We also find an anomalous magnetic field dependence of
decoherence, which is caused by the competition between crystal field splitting
and Zeeman splitting of the central spin. As the external magnetic field
increases, in the V type level structure regime, the decoherence rate becomes
much stronger; while in the cascade type level structure regime, just like
localized electron spin in quantum dots, the decoherence rate becomes much
weaker.

<h3>Sample complexity of matrix product states at finite temperature</h3>

</p><i>Atsushi Iwaki, Chisa Hotta</i>
<p>For quantum many-body systems in one dimension, computational complexity
theory reveals that the evaluation of ground-state energy remains elusive on
quantum computers, contrasting the existence of a classical algorithm for
temperatures higher than the inverse logarithm of the system size. This
highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in
terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states
using the matrix product state formalism. Within the framework of random
samplings, we derive an analytical formula for the required number of samples,
which provides both quantitative and qualitative measures of computational
complexity. At high and low temperatures, its scaling behavior with system size
is linear and quadratic, respectively, demonstrating a distinct crossover
between these numerically difficult regimes of quantitative difference.

<h3>Microscopic Modeling, Multi-magnon condensation and Strain effect in  chain compound NaVOPO$_4$</h3>

</p><i>Manoj Gupta, Manodip Routh, Manoranjan Kumar, Tanusri Saha Dasgupta</i>
<p>Employing first-principles modelling and many-body methods, the magnetic
properties of spin-1/2 chain compound NaVOPO$_4$ are explored. The extensive
first-principles calculations establish an intricate three-dimensionally
coupled model that consists of weakly alternating $J$-$J^{'}$ antiferromagnetic
chains running along cris-cross directions between two consecutive $ab$ planes,
connected via two subleading couplings, a ferromagnetic exchange along the $c$
direction ($J_c$) and a weaker antiferromagnetic exchange ($J_a$) along the
body diagonal direction. The exact diagonalization and density matrix
renormalized group study have been carried out on a two-dimensional spin model
with $J$-$J^{'}$-$J_c$ and effective $J_d$ couplings, constructed based on the
full model, for numerical ease. The $J_c$-$J_d$ phase diagram is found to host
a {\it disorder} phase with finite spin gap for comparable values of $J_c$ and
$J_d$, arising out of the competing nature of these two interactions, other
than two ordered phases. The predominant manifestation of $J_c$ and $J_d$ in
the disorder phase happens in stabilisation of a multi-magnon condensed phase,
upon gap closing by application of an external magnetic field. We further
explore the effect of tensile uniaxial strain, which is found to drive the
system from gapful to gapless ground state.

<h3>Magneto-optical properties of a quantum dot array interacting with a  far-infrared photon mode of a cylindrical cavity</h3>

</p><i>Vidar Gudmundsson, Vram Mughnetsyan, Hsi-Sheng Goan, Jeng-Da Chai, Nzar Rauf Abdullah, Chi-Shung Tang, Valeriu Moldoveanu, Andrei Manolescu</i>
<p>We model the equilibrium properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a
square lateral superlattice of quantum dots in a GaAs heterostructure subject
to an external homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field and a far-infrared
circular cylindrical photon cavity with one quantized mode, the TE011 mode. In
a truncated linear basis constructed by a tensor product of the single-electron
states of the noninteracting system and the eigenstates of the photon number
operator, a local spin density approximation of density functional theory is
used to compute the electron-photon states of the two-dimensional electron gas
in the cavity. The common spatial symmetry of the vector fields for the
external magnetic field and the cavity photon field in the long wavelength
approximation enhances higher order magnetic single- and multi-photon processes
for both the para- and the diamagnetic electron-photon interactions. The
electron-photon coupling introduces explicit photon replicas into the
bandstructure and all subbands gain a photon content, constant for each
subband, that can deviate from an integer value as the coupling is increased or
the photon energy is varied. The subbands show a complex Rabi anticrossing
behavior when the photon energy and the coupling bring subbands into
resonances. The complicated energy subband structure leads to photon density
variations in reciprocal space when resonances occur in the spectrum. The
electron-photon coupling polarizes the charge density and tends to reduce the
Coulomb exchange effects as the coupling strength increases.

<p>The magnetic ground state of single crystalline RuO$_2$ was investigated by
the muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiment. The spin precession
signal due to the spontaneous internal magnetic field $B_{\rm loc}$, which is
expected in the magnetically ordered phase, was not observed in the temperature
range 5--400~K. Muon sites were evaluated by first-principles calculations
using dilute hydrogen simulating muon as pseudo-hydrogen, and $B_{\rm loc}$ was
simulated for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) structures with a Ru magnetic moment
$|{\bf m}_{\rm Ru}|\approx0.05\mu_\mathrm{B}$ suggested from diffraction
experiments. As a result, the possibility was ruled out that muons are
localized at sites where $B_{\rm loc}$ accidentally cancels. Conversely,
assuming that the slow relaxation observed in $\mu$SR spectra was part of the
precession signal, the upper limit for the magnitude of $|{\bf m}_{\rm Ru}|$
was estimated to be $4.8(2)\times10^{-4}\mu_{\rm B}$, which is significantly
less than $0.05\mu_\mathrm{B}$. These results indicate that the AFM order, as
reported, is unlikely to exist in the bulk crystal.

<br>
</p><i>Nikhilesh Maity, Ravi Kashikar, S. Lisenkov, I. Ponomareva</i>
<p>Spin splitting, or removal of spin degeneracy in the electronic energy
band/level is often a measure of spin-orbit coupling strength and a way to
manipulate spin degrees of freedom. We use first-principles simulations to
predict giant spin splitting in methylhydrazinium lead halide (MHyPbX$_3$, MHy
= CH$_3$NH$_2$NH$_2$, X = Br and Cl) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. The
values can reach up to 408.0~meV at zero Kelvin and 281.6~meV at room
temperature. The origin of the effect is traced to the large distortion of
PbX$_3$ framework, driven primarily by Pb ions in the ferroelectric
$\Gamma^{3-}$ mode. The Pb displacements consist of combination of polar and
antipolar arrangements and result in up to 39.2~meV/atom enhancement of the
spin-orbit coupling energy in the polar phase of the materials. The spin-orbit
coupling gives origin to highly persistent spin textures in MHyPbX$_3$, which
are desirable for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Our
findings reveal an additional functionality for hybrid organic-inorganic
perovskite and open a way for the design of more materials with giant spin
splitting.

<p>Traditional analysis of highly distorted micro-X-ray diffraction ({\mu}-XRD)
patterns from hydrothermal fluid environments is a time-consuming process,
often requiring substantial data preprocessing and labeled experimental data.
This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning with a multitask
learning (MTL) architecture to overcome these limitations. We trained MTL
models to identify phase information in {\mu}-XRD patterns, minimizing the need
for labeled experimental data and masking preprocessing steps. Notably, MTL
models showed superior accuracy compared to binary classification CNNs.
Additionally, introducing a tailored cross-entropy loss function improved MTL
model performance. Most significantly, MTL models tuned to analyze raw and
unmasked XRD patterns achieved close performance to models analyzing
preprocessed data, with minimal accuracy differences. This work indicates that
advanced deep learning architectures like MTL can automate arduous data
handling tasks, streamline the analysis of distorted XRD patterns, and reduce
the reliance on labor-intensive experimental datasets.

<h3>Suppression of shear ionic motions in bismuth by coupling with  large-amplitude internal displacement</h3>

</p><i>Kunie Ishioka, Oleg V. Misochko</i>
<p>Bismuth, with its rhombohedral crystalline structure and two Raman active
phonon modes corresponding to the internal displacement ($A_{1g}$) and shear
($E_{g}$) ionic motions, offers an ideal target for the investigation of the
phonon-phonon and electron-phonon couplings under photoexcitation. We perform
transient reflectivity measurements of bismuth single crystal at 11 K over wide
range of absorbed laser fluence up to $F_\text{abs}=9$ mJ/cm$^2$, at which a
sign of an irreversible surface damage is observed. At the minimum fluence
examined (0.1 mJ/cm$^2$) the coherent $A_{1g}$ and $E_g$ oscillations are a
cosine and a sine functions of time, as are consistent with their generations
in the displacive and impulsive limits, respectively. With increasing fluence
the initial phases of the both modes deviate from their low-fluence values,
indicating a finite time required for the transition from the ground-state
potential energy surface (PES) to the excited-state one. Surprisingly, the
$E_g$ amplitude increases with increasing fluence up to 3 mJ/cm$^2$ and then
turns to an apparent decrease, in contrast to the monotonic increase of the
$A_{1g}$ amplitude up to 6 mJ/cm$^2$. The contrasted behaviors can be
understood by considering a two-dimensional PES, where the strongly driven
$A_{1g}$ oscillation leads to a temporal fluctuation of the PES along the $E_g$
coordinate and thereby to a loss in the $E_g$ oscillation coherence at high
fluences.

<h3>Stochastic nanoswimmer: a multistate model for enzyme self-propulsion  and enhanced diffusion</h3>

</p><i>Amit Singh Vishen, Jacques Prost, Madan Rao</i>
<p>Several enzymes show enhanced diffusion in the presence of substrate a
feature that is explained by postulating that the enzyme in the bound state has
a higher diffusion constant than in the unbound state. In a recent experiment
[Jee et al. PNAS, 115, E10812 (2018)], it was observed that some of these
enzymes perform a run-and-tumble motion, where the self-propulsion velocities
can be of the order of mm/s. Theoretical models of nanoscale swimmers have not
been able to explain the high self-propulsion speeds measured in experiments.
Here we model the enzyme as a dimer with fluctuating mobility. We show that
even a dimer can perform a run-and-tumble motion when the dimer switches
between states of different mobility in the enzymatic cycle. Within a
three-state enzymatic cycle, we investigate the conditions under which
self-propulsion speeds consistent with experiments can be obtained.

<p>Finding methods for the most efficient and fastest detection and control of
magnetic domains in antiferromagnets is presently among the main challenges of
magnetic research at large. We analyse the problem of optical read-out and
control of the antiferromagnetic Neel vector using symmetry analysis and the
principles of equilibrium thermodynamics. Following the pioneering approach of
Dzyaloshinksii, we divide all antiferromagnets in three classes. It is shown
that, using the magneto-optical Faraday effect or other effects which scale
linearly with the antiferromagnetic Neel vector, it is possible to distinguish
antiferromagnetic domains with mutually opposite N\'eel vectors in two of the
three classes. Symmetry properties of one of these two classes are similar to
those of altermagnets. The analysis also reveals multiple mechanisms to
directly excite spins with light for practically every type of antiferromagnet.

</p><i>Amirreza Panahi, Di Pu, Giovanniantonio Natale, Anne M. Benneker</i>
<p>In this work, a framework for deriving theoretical equations for mean squared
displacement (MSD) and fractional Fokker-Planck (FFP) is developed for any
arbitrary rheological model. The obtained general results are then specified
for two fractional rheological models. To test our framework and bridge the gap
between microrheology and fractional rheological models, the microrheology of
polystyrene (PS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions at several polymer
concentrations is measured. By comparing the experimental and theoretical MSDs,
we find the fractional rheological parameters and demonstrate that the polymer
concentration regimes can be distinguished using the fractional exponent and
relaxation time data because of the existence of a distinct behavior in each
regime. We suggest simple approximations for the critical overlap concentration
and the shear viscosity of weakly subdiffusive solutions with small relaxation
times. This work provides an alternative and more sensitive approach for
distinguishing different polymer concentration regimes and measuring the
critical overlap concentration and shear viscosity of polymeric solutions,
which is useful when conventional rheological characterization methods are
unreliable due to the volatility and low viscosity of the samples.

<p>Diffusing diffusivity models, polymers in the grand canonical ensemble and
polydisperse, and continuous-time random walks all exhibit stages of
non-Gaussian diffusion. Is non-Gaussian targeting more efficient than Gaussian?
We address this question, central to, e.g., diffusion-limited reactions and
some biological processes, through a general approach that makes use of
Jensen's inequality and that encompasses all these systems. In terms of
customary mean first-passage time, we show that Gaussian searches are more
effective than non-Gaussian ones. A companion paper argues that non-Gaussianity
becomes instead highly more efficient in applications where only a small
fraction of tracers is required to reach the target.

<p>We studied longitudinal and Hall photothermal voltages under a planar
magnetic field scan in epitaxial thin films of the Topological Insulator (TI)
Sb2Te3, grown using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Unlike prior research that
utilised polarised light-induced photocurrent to investigate the TI, our study
introduces advancements based on unpolarized light-induced local heating. This
method yields a thermoelectric response exhibiting a direct signature of strong
spin-orbit coupling. Our analysis reveals three distinct contributions when
fitting the photothermal voltage data to the angular dependence of the planar
magnetic field. The interaction between the applied magnetic field and the
thermal gradient on the bulk band orbitals enables the differentiation between
the ordinary Nernst effect from the out-of-plane thermal gradient and an
extraordinary magneto-thermal contribution from the planar thermal gradient.
The fitting of our data to theoretical models indicates that these effects
primarily arise from the bulk states of the TI rather than the surface states.
These findings highlight PLD-grown epitaxial topological insulator thin films
as promising candidates for optoelectronic devices, including sensors and
actuators. Such devices offer controllable responses through
position-dependent, non-invasive local heating via focused incident light and
variations in the applied magnetic field direction.

<p>Redundancy in biology may be explained by the need to optimize extreme
searching processes, where one or few among many particles are requested to
reach the target like in human fertilization. We show that non-Gaussian rare
fluctuations in Brownian diffusion dominates such searches, introducing drastic
corrections to the known Gaussian behavior. Our demonstration entails different
physical systems and pinpoints the relevance of diversity within redundancy to
boost fast targeting. We sketch an experimental context to test our results:

<h3>Disordered non-Fermi liquid fixed point for two-dimensional metals at  Ising-nematic quantum critical points</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Kyoung-Min Kim, Ki-Seok Kim</i>
<p>Understanding the influence of quenched random potential is crucial for
comprehending the exotic electronic transport of non-Fermi liquid metals near
metallic quantum critical points. In this study, we identify a stable fixed
point governing the quantum critical behavior of two-dimensional non-Fermi
liquid metals in the presence of a random potential disorder. By performing
renormalization group analysis on a dimensional-regularized field theory for
Ising-nematic quantum critical points, we systematically investigate the
interplay between random potential disorder for electrons and Yukawa-type
interactions between electrons and bosonic order-parameter fluctuations in a
perturbative epsilon expansion. At the one-loop order, the effective field
theory lacks stable fixed points, instead exhibiting a runaway flow toward
infinite disorder strength. However, at the two-loop order, the effective field
theory converges to a stable fixed point characterized by finite disorder
strength, termed the "disordered non-Fermi liquid (DNFL) fixed point." Our
investigation reveals that two-loop vertex corrections induced by Yukawa
couplings are pivotal in the emergence of the DNFL fixed point, primarily
through screening disorder scattering. Additionally, the DNFL fixed point is
distinguished by a substantial anomalous scaling dimension of fermion fields,
resulting in pseudogap-like behavior in the electron's density of states. These
findings shed light on the quantum critical behavior of disordered non-Fermi
liquid metals, emphasizing the indispensable role of higher-order loop
corrections in such comprehension.

<h3>Self-Aligning Polar Active Matter</h3>

</p><i>Paul Baconnier, Olivier Dauchot, Vincent Démery, Gustavo Düring, Silke Henkes, Cristián Huepe, Amir Shee</i>
<p>Self-alignment describes the property of a polar active unit to align or
anti-align its orientation towards its velocity. In contrast to mutual
alignment, where the headings of multiple active units tend to directly align
to each other -- as in the celebrated Vicsek model --, self-alignment impacts
the dynamics at the individual level by coupling the rotation and displacements
of each active unit. This enriches the dynamics even without interactions or
external forces, and allows, for example, a single self-propelled particle to
orbit in a harmonic potential. At the collective level, self-alignment modifies
the nature of the transition to collective motion already in the mean field
description, and it can also lead to other forms of self-organization such as
collective actuation in dense or solid elastic assemblies of active units. This
has significant implications for the study of dense biological systems,
metamaterials, and swarm robotics. Here, we review a number of models that were
introduced independently to describe the previously overlooked property of
self-alignment and identify some of its experimental realizations. Our aim is
three-fold: (i)~underline the importance of self-alignment in active systems,
especially in the context of dense populations of active units and active
solids; (ii)~provide a unified mathematical and conceptual framework for the
description of self-aligning systems; (iii)~discuss the common features and
specific differences of the existing models of self-alignment. We conclude by
discussing promising research avenues in which the concept of self-alignment
could play a significant role.

<p>Silicon oxycarbides show outstanding versatility due to their highly tunable
composition and microstructure. Consequently, a key challenge is a thorough
knowledge of structure-property relations in the system. In this work, we fit
an atomic cluster expansion potential to a set of actively learned DFT training
data spanning a wide configurational space. We demonstrate the ability of the
potential to produce realistic amorphous structures and rationalize the
formation of different morphologies of the turbostratic free carbon phase.
Finally, we relate the materials stiffness to its composition and
microstructure, finding a delicate dependence on Si-C bonds that contradicts
commonly assumed relations to the free carbon phase.

<h3>Spontaneous spin chirality reversal and competing phases in the  topological magnet EuAl$_4$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>A. M. Vibhakar, D. D. Khalyavin, F. Orlandi, J. M. Moya, S. Lei, E. Morosan, A. Bombardi</i>
<p>We demonstrate the spontaneous reversal of spin chirality in a single crystal
sample of the intermetallic magnet EuAl$_4$. We solve the nanoscopic nature of
each of the four magnetically phases of EuAl$_4$ using resonant magnetic x-ray
scattering, and demonstrate all four phases order with single-k incommensurate
magnetic modulation vectors. Below 15.4 K the system forms a spin density
modulated spin structure where the spins are orientated in the ab plane
perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic propagation vector. Below 13.2
K a second spin density wave orders with moments aligned parallel to the
c-axis, such that the two spin density wave orders coexist. Below 12.2 K a
magnetic helix of a single chirality is stabilised across the entire sample.
Below 10 K the chirality of the magnetic helix reverses, and the sample remains
a single chiral domain. Concomitant with the establishment of the helical
magnetic ordering is the lowering of the crystal symmetry to monoclinic, as
evidenced the formation of uniaxial charge and spin strip domains. A group
theoretical analysis demonstrates that below 12.2 K the symmetry lowers to
polar monoclinic, which is necessary to explain the observed asymmetry in the
chiral states of the magnetic helix and the spin chiral reversal. We find that
in every magnetically ordered phase of EuAl4 the in-plane moment is
perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic propagation vector, which we
demonstrate is favoured by magnetic dipolar interactions.

<h3>Two-step aging dynamics in enzymatic milk gels</h3>

</p><i>Julien Bauland, Gouranga Manna, Thibaut Divoux, Thomas Gibaud</i>
<p>Colloidal gels undergo a phenomenon known as physical aging, i.e., a
continuous change of their physical properties with time after the gel point.
To date, most of the research effort on aging in gels has been focused on
suspensions of hard colloidal particles. In this letter, we tackle the case of
soft colloidal "micelles" comprised of proteins, where gelation is induced by
the addition of an enzyme. Using time-resolved mechanical spectroscopy, we
monitor the viscoelastic properties of a suspension of colloidal micelles
through the sol-gel transition and its subsequent aging. We show that the
microscopic scenario underpinning the macroscopic aging dynamics comprises two
sequential steps. First, the gel microstructure undergoes rapid coarsening, as
observed by optical microscopy, followed by arrest. Second, aging occurs solely
through a contact-driven mechanism, as evidenced by the square-root dependence
of the yield stress with the elastic modulus measured at different ages of the
gel. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of aging in enzymatic
milk gels, which is crucial not only for a broad range of dairy products, but
also for soft colloids in general.

<h3>Active nematic-isotropic interfaces on flat surfaces: effects of  anchoring, ordering field and activity</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10178" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10178</a>
<br>
</p><i>Rodrigo C. V. Coelho, José A. Moreira, Duarte M. C. Pedro, Margarida M. Telo da Gama</i>
<p>A surface in contact with the isotropic phase of a passive liquid crystal can
induce nematic order over distances that range from microscopic to macroscopic
when the nematic-isotropic interface undergoes an orientational-wetting
transition. If the nematic is active, what happens to the interface? Does it
propagate and, if it does, is its structure different from the passive one? In
this paper, we address these questions. We investigate how the active
nematic-isotropic interface is affected by the anchoring strength of the
surface, the bulk ordering field and the activity. We find that while passive
interfaces are one-dimensional the active ones exhibit two dynamical regimes: a
passive-like regime and a propagating regime where the interfaces propagate
until the entire domain is active nematic. Active interfaces break the
translational symmetry within the interfacial plane above a threshold activity,
where the active nematic fluctuations, which are ultimately responsible for the
emergence of an active turbulent nematic phase, drive non-steady dynamical
interfacial regimes.

<h3>Effects of spin-orbit coupling in a valley chiral kagomé network</h3>

</p><i>P. Wittig, F. Dominguez, P. Recher</i>
<p>Valley chiral kagom\'e networks can arise in various situations, like for
example, in double-aligned graphene-hexagonal boron nitride and periodically
strained graphene. Here, we construct a phenomenological scattering model based
on the symmetries of the network to investigate the energy spectrum and
magnetotransport in this system. Additionally, we consider the effects of a
finite Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the transport properties of the kagom\'e
network. We identify conditions where the interplay of the Rashba spin-orbit
coupling and the geometry of the lattice results in a reduction of the
periodicity of the magnetoconductance and characteristic sharp resonances.
Moreover, we find a finite spin-polarization of the conductance, which could be
exploited in spintronic devices.

<h3>Half-metallic transport and spin-polarized tunneling through the van der  Waals ferromagnet Fe${_4}$GeTe$_{2}$</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Anita Halder, Declan Nell, Antik Sihi, Akash Bajaj, Stefano Sanvito, Andrea Droghetti</i>
<p>The recent emergence of van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new
opportunities for designing spintronic devices. We theoretically investigate
the coherent spin-dependent transport properties of the vdW ferromagnet
Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, by using density functional theory combined with the
non-equilibrium Green's functions method. We find that the conductance in the
direction perpendicular to the layers is half-metallic, namely it is entirely
spin-polarized, as a result of the material's electronic structure. This
characteristic persists from bulk to single layer, even under significant bias
voltages, and it is little affected by spin-orbit coupling and electron
correlation. Motivated by this observation, we then investigate the tunnel
magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in an magnetic tunnel junction, which comprises
two Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ layers separated by the vdW gap acting as insulating
barrier. We predict a TMR ratio of almost 500\%, which can be further boosted
by increasing the number of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ layers in the junction.

<h3>Steering internal and outgoing electron dynamics in bilayer graphene  cavities by cavity design</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Lukas Seemann, Angelika Knothe, Martina Hentschel</i>
<p>Ballistic, gate-defined devices in two-dimensional materials offer a platform
for electron optics phenomena influenced by the material's properties and gate
control. We study the ray trajectory dynamics of all-electronic, gate-defined
cavities in bilayer graphene to establish how distinct regimes of the internal
and outgoing charge carrier dynamics can be tuned and optimized by the cavity
shape, symmetry, and parameter choice, e.g., the band gap and the cavity
orientation. In particular, we compare the dynamics of two cavity shapes,
o'nigiri, and Lima\c{c}on cavities, which fall into different symmetry classes.
We demonstrate that for stabilising regular, internal cavity modes, such as
periodic and whispering gallery orbits, it is beneficial to match the cavity
shape to the bilayer graphene Fermi line contour. Conversely, a cavity of a
different symmetry than the material dispersion allows one to determine
preferred emission directionalities in the emitted far-field.

<h3>Structure, control, and dynamics of altermagnetic textures</h3>

<p>We present a phenomenological theory of altermagnets, that captures their
unique magnetization dynamics and allows modelling magnetic textures in this
new magnetic phase. Focusing on the prototypical d-wave altermagnets, e.g.
RuO$_2$, we can explain intuitively the characteristic lifted degeneracy of
their magnon spectra, by the emergence of an effective sublattice-dependent
anisotropic spin stiffness arising naturally from the phenomenological theory.
We show that as a consequence the altermagnetic domain walls, in contrast to
antiferromagnets, have a finite gradient of the magnetization, with its
strength and gradient direction connected to the altermagnetic anisotropy, even
for 180$^\circ$ domain walls. This gradient generates a ponderomotive force in
the domain wall in the presence of a strongly inhomogeneous external magnetic
field, which may be achieved through magnetic force microscopy techniques. The
motion of these altermagentic domain walls is also characterized by an
anisotropic Walker breakdown, with much higher speed limits of propagation than
ferromagnets but lower than antiferromagnets.

<p>While the understanding of altermagnetism is still at a very early stage, it
is expected to play a role in various fields of condensed matter research, for
example spintronics, caloritronics and superconductivity. In the field of
optical magnetism, it is still unclear to which extent altermagnets as a class
can exhibit a distinct behavior. Here we choose RuO$_2$, a prototype metallic
altermagnet with a giant spin splitting, and CoF$_2$, an experimentally known
insulating altermagnet, to study the light-induced magnetism in rutile
altermagnets from first-principles. We demonstrate that in the non-relativisic
limit the allowed sublattice-resolved orbital response exhibits symmetries,
imposed by altermagnetism, which lead to a drastic canting of light-induced
moments. On the other hand, we find that inclusion of spin-orbit interaction
enhances the overall effect drastically, introduces a significant anisotropy
with respect to the light polarization and strongly suppresses the canting of
induced moments. Remarkably, we observe that the moments induced by
linearly-polarized laser pulses in light altermagnets can even exceed in
magnitude those predicted for heavy ferromagnets exposed to circularly
polarized light. By resorting to microscopic tools we interpret our results in
terms of the altermagnetic spin splittings and of their reciprocal space
distribution. Based on our findings, we speculate that optical excitations may
provide a unique tool to switch and probe the magnetic state of rutile
altermagnets.

crack-template-based transparent conductive films as well some random networks
produced using nano-imprinting technology. Applying an effective medium theory,

<p>We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double
quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic
construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is
proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the
electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering
states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the
long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum
dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as
time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose
wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving
resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a
finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states
enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of
electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions.
It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of
resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as
a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.

as reflected by the effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the Seebeck

<h3>Pattern selection and the route to turbulence in incompressible polar  active fluids</h3>

</p><i>Henning Reinken, Sebastian Heidenreich, Markus Bär, Sabine H. L. Klapp</i>
<p>Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to
self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example
is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a
characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective
microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from
regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters
such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First,
we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints,
develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear
advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this
nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from
the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes.
This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the
analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity
parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into
mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical
approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are
possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence
persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the
stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and
represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from
classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns
shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our
results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active
turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial
turbulence.

<p>Digital image correlation is a widely used technique in the field of
experimental mechanics. In fracture mechanics, determining the precise location
of the crack tip is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a universal crack tip
detection algorithm based on displacement and strain fields obtained by digital
image correlation. Iterative crack tip correction formulas are discovered by
applying deep symbolic regression guided by physical unit constraints to a
dataset of simulated cracks under mode I, II and mixed-mode conditions with
variable T-stress. For the training dataset, we fit the Williams series
expansion with super-singular terms to the simulated displacement fields at
randomly chosen origins around the actual crack tip. We analyse the discovered
formulas and apply the most promising one to digital image correlation data
obtained from uniaxial and biaxial fatigue crack growth experiments of
AA2024-T3 sheet material. Throughout the experiments, the crack tip positions
are reliably detected leading to improved stability of the crack propagation
curves.

<p>The jamming transition is an important feature of granular materials, with
prior work showing an excess of low frequency modes in the granular analog to
the density of states, the granular density of modes. In this work, we present
an experimental method for acoustically measuring the granular density of modes
using a single impact event to excite vibrational modes in an experimental,
three dimensional, granular material. We test three different granular
materials, all of which are composed of spherical beads. The first two systems
are monodisperse collections of either 6 mm or 8 mm diameter beads. The third
system is a bidisperse mixture of the previous two bead sizes. During data
collection, the particles are confined to a box; on top of this box, and
resting on the granular material, is a light, rigid sheet onto which pressure
can be applied to the system. To excite the material, a steel impactor ball is
dropped on top of the system. The response of the granular material to the
impact pulse is recorded by piezoelectric sensors buried throughout the
material, and the density of modes is computed from the spectrum of the
velocity autocorrelation of these sensors. Our measurements of the density of
modes show more low frequency modes at low pressure, consistent with previous
experimental and numerical results, as well as several low frequency peaks in
the density of modes that shift with applied pressure. Finally, we also see
that the density of modes falls off at a wavelength on the order of twice the
particle diameter, which is reminiscent of the Debye frequency.

<p>Extensive research has focused on phenomena arising from the chirality of
crystalline or magnetic structures. Recently, we have proposed the "Nonlinear
Chiral Thermo-Electric (NCTE) Hall effect," in which current flows in the
direction of the cross product of the electric field and the temperature
gradient in a material with a chiral structure. Despite its importance for
device applications such as heat flow sensors and logic circuits, there are no
quantitative demonstrations in actual materials. We investigate the NCTE Hall
effect and the second-order response to the electric field in Te, which hosts
the chiral crystal structure, based on $ab \ initio$ calculations and symmetry
argument. We clarify that the NCTE Hall current can flow parallel to the chiral
axis, whereas such behavior is absent for the second-order response to the DC
electric field. Quantitative estimation predicts the large NCTE Hall current
which is sufficiently detectable in experiments, and the orbital magnetic
moment will play an important role in the vicinity of the top of the valence
band.

<p>Hybrid density functional approximations (DFAs) offer compelling accuracy for
ab initio electronic-structure simulations of molecules, nanosystems, and bulk
materials, addressing some deficiencies of computationally cheaper, frequently
used semilocal DFAs. However, the computational bottleneck of hybrid DFAs is
the evaluation of the non-local exact exchange contribution, which is the
limiting factor for the application of the method for large-scale simulations.
In this work, we present a drastically optimized resolution-of-identity-based
real-space implementation of the exact exchange evaluation for both
non-periodic and periodic boundary conditions in the all-electron code
FHI-aims, targeting high-performance CPU compute clusters. The introduction of
several new refined Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallelization layers and
shared memory arrays according to the MPI-3 standard were the key components of
the optimization. We demonstrate significant improvements of memory and
performance efficiency, scalability, and workload distribution, extending the
reach of hybrid DFAs to simulation sizes beyond ten thousand atoms. As a
necessary byproduct of this work, other code parts in FHI-aims have been
optimized as well, e.g., the computation of the Hartree potential and the
evaluation of the force and stress components. We benchmark the performance and
scaling of the hybrid DFA based simulations for a broad range of chemical
systems, including hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, organic crystals and
ice crystals with up to 30,576 atoms (101,920 electrons described by 244,608
basis functions).

<h3>Quantum Magnetic Skyrmion Operator</h3>

<p>We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as
bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features
of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of
local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground
states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the
single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum
corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding
of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is
valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions
can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles,
which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases
which, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum
fluctuations of individual skyrmions.

<h3>One-dimensional Lieb superlattices: from the discrete to the continuum  limit</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Dylan Jones, Marcin Mucha-Kruczynski, Adelina Ilie, Lucian Covaci</i>
<p>The Lieb lattice is one of the simplest lattices that exhibits both linear
Dirac-like and flat topological electronic bands. We propose to further tailor
its electronic properties through periodic 1D electrostatic superlattices
(SLs), which, in the long wavelength limit, were predicted to give rise to
novel transport signatures, such as the omnidirectional super-Klein tunnelling
(SKT). By numerically modelling the electronic structure at tight-binding
level, we uncover the evolution of the Lieb SL band structure from the discrete
all the way to the continuum regime and build a comprehensive picture of the
Lieb lattice under 1D potentials. This approach allows us to also take into
consideration the discrete lattice symmetry-breaking that occurs at the
well/barrier interfaces created by the 1D SL, whose consequences cannot be
explored using the previous low energy and long wavelength approaches. We find
novel features in the band structure, among which are intersections of
quadratic and flat bands, tilted Dirac cones, or series of additional
anisotropic Dirac cones at energies where the SKT is predicted. Such features
are relevant to experimental realizations of electronic transport in Lieb 1D SL
realized in artificial lattices or in real material systems like 2D covalent
organic/metal-organic frameworks and inorganic 2D solids.

<h3>Beyond structural stabilization of highly-textured AlN thin film: the  role of chemical effects</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10385" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10385</a>
<br>
</p><i>O.V. Pshyk, J. Patidar, S. Siol</i>
<p>The crystalline quality and degree of c-axis orientation of hexagonal AlN
thin films correlate directly with their functional properties. Therefore,
achieving AlN thin films of high crystalline quality and texture is of
extraordinary importance for many applications, but in particular in electronic
devices. Here, we present a systematic study revealing that the growth of
c-axis orientated AlN thin films can be governed by a chemical stabilization
effect in addition to the conventionally known structural, i.e. strain-induced,
stabilization mechanism. The promotion of in-plane growth of AlN grains with
c-axis out-of-plane orientation is demonstrated on Y, W or Al seed layers with
different thicknesses and crystallinity preliminary exposed to N2 at room
temperature. We establish that the stabilization mechanism is chemical in
nature: the formation of an N-rich surface layer on the metal seed layers upon
exposure to N2 pre-determines the polarity of AlN islands at initial stages of
thin film growth while the low energy barrier for the subsequent coalescence of
islands of the same polarity contributes to grain growth. These results suggest
that the growth of c-axis oriented AlN thin films can be optimized and
controlled chemically thus opening more pathways for energy-efficient and
controllable AlN thin-film growth processes.

<h3>Gating single-molecule fluorescence with electrons</h3>

</p><i>Katharina Kaiser, Michelangelo Romeo, Fabrice Scheurer, Guillaume Schull, Anna Rosławska</i>
<p>Tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL) measurements are performed with
sub-nanometer spatial resolution on individual molecules decoupled from a
metallic substrate by a thin NaCl layer. TEPL spectra reveal progressive
fluorescence quenching with decreasing tip-molecule distance when electrons
tunneling from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope are injected at
resonance with the molecular states. Rate equations based on a many-body model
reveal that the luminescence quenching is due to a progressive population
inversion between the ground neutral (S$_0$) and the ground charge ($D_0^-$)
states of the molecule occurring when the current is raised. We demonstrate
that both the bias voltage and the atomic-scale lateral position of the tip can
be used to gate the molecular emission. Our approach can in principle be
applied to any molecular system, providing unprecedented control over the
fluorescence of a single molecule.

<h3>Versatile Capillary Cells for Handling Concentrated Samples in  Analytical Ultracentrifugation</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10418</a>
<br>
</p><i>Quy Ong, Xufeng Xu, Francesco Stellacci</i>
<p>In concentrated macromolecular dispersions, far-from-ideal intermolecular
interactions determine the dispersion behaviors including phase transition,
crystallization, and liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we present a novel
versatile capillary-cell design for analytical
ultracentrifugation-sedimentation equilibrium (AUC-SE), ideal for studying
samples at high concentrations. Current setups for such studies are difficult
and unreliable to handle, leading to a low experimental success rate. The
design presented here is easy to use, robust, and reusable for samples in both
aqueous and organic solvents while requiring no special tools or chemical
modification of AUC cells. The key and unique feature is the fabrication of
liquid reservoirs directly on the bottom window of AUC cells, which can be
easily realized by laser ablation or mechanical drilling. The channel length
and optical path length are therefore tunable. The success rate for assembling
this new cell is close to 100%. We demonstrate the practicality of this cell by
studying: 1) the equation of state and second virial coefficients of
concentrated gold nanoparticle dispersions in water and bovine serum albumin
(BSA) as well as lysozyme solution in aqueous buffers, 2) the gelation phase
transition of DNA and BSA solutions, and 3) liquid-liquid phase separation of
concentrated BSA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) droplets.

<h3>Ferroelectric phases and phase transitions in CsGeBr$_3$ induced by  mechanical load</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10421" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10421</a>
<br>
</p><i>Joshua Townsend, Ravi Kashikar, S. Lisenkov, I. Ponomareva</i>
<p>First-principles-based atomistic simulations are used to reveal ferroelectric
phases and phase transitions induced in a semiconductor ferroelectric,
CsGeBr$_3$, by external loads: hydrostatic pressure, uniaxial and biaxial
stresses, and misfit strain. Hydrostatic pressure was found to suppress the
Curie point at the rate -0.45$T_C(0)$ K/GPa, where $T_C(0)$ is the zero
pressure Curie temperature. Stresses and misfit strains were found to induce
additional ferroelectric phase transitions and phases not available under
normal conditions. We find that tensile load significantly enhances both the
Curie temperature and spontaneous polarization, while compressive load has the
opposite effect but with the difference that the Curie temperature is only
slightly suppressed. The isothermal dependencies of polarization on pressure
and stresses are highly nonlinear, which could result in large nonlinear
piezoelectric responses. The phase diagrams reveal the diversity of the phases
accessible through mechanical load, which include tetragonal, orthorhombic and
monoclinic symmetries in addition to the rhombohedral and cubic ones realizable
under normal conditions. We believe that this work reveals the potential of
Ge-based halide perovskites for applications in energy converting devices,
which is especially significant in the current pursuit of environmental
friendly lead-free technologies.

<h3>Quantifying nonuniversal corner free-energy contributions in  weakly-anisotropic two-dimensional critical systems</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Florian Kischel, Stefan Wessel</i>
<p>We derive an exact formula for the corner free-energy contribution of
weakly-anisotropic two-dimensional critical systems in the Ising universality
class on rectangular domains, expressed in terms of quantities that specify the
anisotropic fluctuations. The resulting expression agrees with numerical exact
calculations that we perform for the anisotropic triangular Ising model and
quantifies the nonuniversality of the corner term for anisotropic critical
two-dimensional systems. Our generic formula is expected to apply also to other
weakly-anisotropic critical two-dimensional systems that allow for a conformal
field theory description in the isotropic limit. We consider the 3-states and
4-states Potts models as further specific examples.

<h3>Variance sum rule: proofs and solvable models</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Ivan Di Terlizzi, Marco Baiesi, Felix Ritort</i>
<p>We derive, in more general conditions, a recently introduced variance sum
rule (VSR) [I. Di Terlizzi et al., 2024 Science 383 971] involving variances of
displacement and force impulse for overdamped Langevin systems in a
nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). This formula allows visualising the effect
of nonequilibrium as a deviation of the sum of variances from normal diffusion
$2Dt$, with $D$ the diffusion constant and $t$ the time. From the VSR, we also
derive formulas for the entropy production rate $\sigma$ that, differently from
previous results, involve second-order time derivatives of position correlation
functions. This novel feature gives a criterion for discriminating strong
nonequilibrium regimes without measuring forces. We then apply and discuss our
results to three analytically solved models: a stochastic switching trap, a
Brownian vortex, and a Brownian gyrator. Finally, we compare the advantages and
limitations of known and novel formulas for $\sigma$ in an overdamped NESS.

<br>
</p><i>Simran Chourasia, Aleksandr Svetogorov, Akashdeep Kamra, Wolfgang Belzig</i>
<p>Recently introduced magnetic materials called altermagnets (AM) feature zero
net magnetization but a momentum dependent magnetic exchange field, which can
have intriguing implications when combined with superconductivity. In our work,
we use the quasiclassical framework to study the effects of such a material on
a conventional superconductor (S) in an AM/S bilayer. We discuss the
superconducting phase diagram and heat capacity of AM/S while making a
comparison with a ferromagnet-superconductor bilayer. Furthermore, we examine
the density of states and analyze the system's response to an external magnetic
field. We illustrate the anisotropy of spin-susceptibility and magnetization of
AM/S by considering an external field in the in-plane and out-of-plane
direction, thereby facilitating the scope of experimental detection and
characterization of an AM in an AM/S hybrid system.

<h3>Microscopic understanding of NMR signals by dynamic mean-field theory  for spins</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Timo Gräßer, Thomas Hahn, Götz S. Uhrig</i>
<p>A recently developed dynamic mean-field theory for disordered spins
(spinDMFT) is shown to capture the spin dynamics of nuclear spins very well.
The key quantities are the spin autocorrelations. In order to compute the free
induction decay (FID), pair correlations are needed in addition. They can be
computed on spin clusters of moderate size which are coupled to the dynamic
mean fields determined in a first step by spinDMFT. We dub this versatile
approach non-local spinDMFT (nl-spinDMFT). It is a particular asset of
nl-spinDMFT that one knows from where the contributions to the FID stem. We
illustrate the strengths of nl-spinDMFT in comparison to experimental data for
CaF$_2$. Furthermore, spinDMFT provides the dynamic mean-fields explaining the
FID of the nuclear spins in $^{13}$C in adamantane up to some static noise. The
spin Hahn echo in adamantane is free from effects of static noise and agrees
excellently with the spinDMFT results without further fitting.

<h3>Defect design in ferroelectrics -- new insights on agglomeration</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10467" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10467</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sheng-Han Teng, Anna Grünebohm</i>
<p>Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend
crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields
induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important
role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order,
agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and
functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we
screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics
simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical
ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the
{\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration
is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces
the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase
stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects
appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field
hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and their impact on the
phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For
this agglomeration, we furthermore find that pinched field hysteresis, which is
beneficial, e.g. for energy storage, can be achieved for a wide range of defect
dipole strengths and thus is not too sensitive to the choice of dopants.

<p>Computational materials science produces large quantities of data, both in
terms of high-throughput calculations and individual studies. Extracting
knowledge from this large and heterogeneous pool of data is challenging due to
the wide variety of computational methods and approximations, resulting in
significant veracity in the sheer amount of available data. Here, we present
MADAS, a Python framework for computing similarity relations between material
properties. It can be used to automate the download of data from various
sources, compute descriptors and similarities between materials, analyze the
relationship between materials through their properties, and can incorporate a
variety of existing machine learning methods. We explain the design of the
package and demonstrate its power with representative examples.

<h3>Critical Fluctuations at Finite-Time Dynamical Phase Transition</h3>

<p>We explore the critical properties of the recently discovered finite-time
dynamical phase transition in the non-equilibrium relaxation of Ising magnets.
The transition is characterized by a sudden switch in the relaxation dynamics
and it occurs at a sharp critical time. While previous works have focused
either on mean-field interactions or on investigating the properties of the
critical time, we analyze the critical fluctuations at the phase transition in
the nearest-neighbor Ising model on a square lattice using Monte Carlo
simulations. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the
critical exponents for the transition. In two spatial dimensions, the exponents
are consistent with those of the two-dimensional Ising universality class.

</p><i>Tanumoy Dhar, David Saintillan</i>
<p>The dispersion of a passive colloid immersed in a bath of non-interacting and
non-Brownian run-and-tumble microswimmers in two dimensions is analyzed using
stochastic simulations and an asymptotic theory, both based on a minimal model
of swimmer-colloid collisions characterized solely by frictionless steric
interactions. We estimate the effective long-time diffusivity $\mathcal{D}$ of
the suspended colloid resulting from its interaction with the active bath, and
elucidate its dependence on the level of activity (persistence length of
swimmer trajectories), the mobility ratio of the colloid to a swimmer, and the
number density of swimmers in the bath. We also propose a semi-analytical model
for the colloid diffusivity in terms of the variance and correlation time of
the net fluctuating active force on the colloid resulting from swimmer
collisions. Quantitative agreement is found between numerical simulations and
analytical results in the experimentally-relevant regime of low swimmer
density, low mobility ratios, and high activity.

</p><i>Peng Rao, Alexander Mook, Johannes Knolle</i>
<p>We study two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic metals taking into account
the presence of substrate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We consider the
altermagnet bandstructure using a 2D band Hamiltonian near the $\Gamma$ point
under external magnetic field. It is shown that time-reversal-symmetry breaking
due to altermagnetism, together with Rashba coupling and external magnetic
field, can result in non-trivial band topology. The topological phases can be
tuned by magnetic field strength and directions, and are classified by their
Chern numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the charge response by computing the
full optical conductivity tensor with and without magnetic field. In
particular, we focus on magneto-optical responses, which are the
finite-frequency analog of the Berry curvature-induced anomalous Hall
conductivity. Finally, using experimentally realistic parameters for RuO$_2$,
we estimate the Faraday angle in the absence of magnetic fields.
