<h3>Tuning the circularly polarized photoluminescence of chiral 2D  perovskites by high pressure</h3>

Chiral 2D perovskites are of great interest as circularly polarized
photoluminescence materials, but these materials generally exhibit weak CPL
under ambient conditions. Several studies have shown that the degree of CPL can
be enhanced by using strong external magnetic fields or low temperature. Here
we report a method to tune the circularly polarized photoluminescence of chiral
2D perovskites by utilizing extreme high pressure. The (S- and R-MBA)2PbI4
perovskites exhibited good optical tunability with pressure in term of PL
wavelength, intensity and bandgap. Polarization-resolved photoluminescence
measurements shown that the degree of CPL was increased from nearly zero at
ambient pressure to as high as 10% at 8.5 GPa. ADXRD and Raman results
indicated that the structural distortion and Increased interlayer coupling are
responsible for the enhanced chirality when pressure is applied. Our findings
provide a new approach to adjusting CPL materials and show potential
applications in next generation of CPL devices.

We report on elastic and inelastic neutron scattering from single-grain
isotopically-enriched samples to elucidate the local magnetic correlations
between Tb$^{3+}$ moments in quasicrystalline i-Tb-Cd. The inelastic neutron
scattering measurements of the CEF excitations demonstrated that the Tb$^{3+}$
moments are directed primarily along the local five-fold axes of the Tsai-type
cluster as was found for the TbCd6 approximant phase. Based on the inelastic
measurements, we consider of a simple Ising-type model for the moment
configurations on a single Tb$^{3+}$ icosahedron and enumerate the lowest
energy moment configurations. We then calculate the diffuse scattering from
these configurations and compare with the experimental magnetic diffuse
scattering measurements to identify the most likely single cluster moment
configurations and find reasonable agreement between the broad features
observed in our scattering simulations. We further consider the role of
higher-order (longer range) intercluster correlations for the magnetic
scattering.

<h3>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in the Two-Component Bose-Hubbard Model</h3>

We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model for
two-component bosons using a strong-coupling approach within the
closed-time-path formalism and develop an effective theory for the action of
this problem. We obtain equations of motion for the superfluid order parameters
of both boson species for both the superfluid and Mott-insulating phases and
study these in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit during a quantum quench
for various initial conditions. We find that an additional degree of freedom
for bosons leads to a richer phase diagram and out-of-equilibrium dynamics than
the single-component situation.

<h3>Coulomb drag in metallic twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11739" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11739</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Strongly correlated phases in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) typically arise
as transitions from a state in which the system behaves as a normal metal. In
such metallic regime, electron-electron interactions usually only play a
subleading role in transport measurements, compared to the dominant scattering
mechanism. Here, we propose and theoretically study an exception to this based
on a Coulomb drag setup between two metallic TBG, separated so that they only
couple through many-body interactions. We find that by solely varying the twist
angle equally in both TBG, the drag resistivity exhibits a unique maximum as
the system crossovers from a degenerate to a nondegenerate regime. When the
twist angles in each TBG differ, we find an anomalous drag resistivity
characterized by the appearance of multiple peaks. We show that this behavior
can be related to the dependence of the rectification function on the twist
angle.

Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) have become a key area of research in magnetism
due to their remarkable properties, such as long-range entanglement, fractional
excitations, pinch-point singularities, and topologically protected phenomena.
In recent years, the search for QSLs has expanded into the three-dimensional
world, where promising features have been found in materials that form
pyrochlore and hyper-kagome lattices, despite the suppression of quantum
fluctuations due to high dimensionality. One such material is the $S = 1$
K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ compound, which belongs to the langbeinite family
consisting of two interconnected trillium lattices. Although magnetically
ordered, K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ has been found to exhibit a highly dynamical
and correlated state which can be driven into a pure quantum spin liquid under
magnetic fields of only $B \simeq 4$~T. In this article, we combine inelastic
neutron scattering measurements with pseudo-fermion functional renormalization
group (PFFRG) and classical Monte Carlo (cMC) calculations to study the
magnetic properties of K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$, revealing a high level of
agreement between the experiment and theory. We further reveal the origin of
the dynamical state in K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ by studying a larger set of
exchange parameters, uncovering an `island of liquidity' around a focal point
given by a magnetic network composed of tetrahedra on a trillium lattice.

The recent experimental claim of room-temperature ambient-pressure
superconductivity in a Cu-doped lead-apatite (LK-99) has ignited substantial
research interest in both experimental and theoretical domains. Previous
collinear density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the inclusion of an
on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ consistently predict the presence of flat bands
crossing the Fermi level. This is in contrast to DFT plus dynamical mean field
theory calculations, which reveal the Mott insulating behavior for the
stoichiometric Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O compound. However, the existing
calculations are all based on the $P6_3/m$ structure, which is argued to be not
the ground-state structure. Here, we revisit the electronic structure of
Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O with the energetically more favorable $P\bar{3}$
structure, fully taking into account the crystal structure and electronic
symmetry breaking. We examine all possible configurations for Cu substituting
the Pb sites. Our results show that the doped Cu atoms exhibit a preference for
substituting the Pb2 sites than the Pb1 sites. In both cases, the calculated
substitutional formation energies are large, indicating the difficulty in
incorporating Cu at Pb sites. We find that most of structures with Cu at the
Pb2 site tend to exhibit insulating states, while the structures with both two
Cu atoms at the Pb1 sites (except one configuration) are predicted to be
metallic by magnetically collinear DFT+$U$ calculations. However, when
accounting for the electronic symmetry breaking, some Cu-doped configurations
(including the one employed in previous DFT+$U$ calculations) become
insulating. Our work highlights the importance of symmetry breaking in
obtaining correct electronic state for Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O, thereby
reconciling previous collinear DFT+$U$ and DFT+DMFT calculations.

Finding materials exhibiting superconductivity at room temperature has long
been one of the ultimate goals in physics and material science. Recently,
room-temperature superconducting properties have been claimed in a copper
substituted lead phosphate apatite (Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O, or called
LK-99) [1-3]. Using a similar approach, we have prepared LK-99 like samples and
confirmed the half-levitation behaviors in some small specimens under the
influence of a magnet at room temperature. To examine the magnetic properties
of our samples, we have performed systematic magnetization measurements on the
as-grown LK-99-like samples, including the half-levitated and non-levitated
samples. The magnetization measurements show the coexistence of
soft-ferromagnetic and diamagnetic signals in both half-levitated and
non-levitated samples. The electrical transport measurements on the as-grown
LK-99-like samples including both half-levitated and non-levitated samples show
an insulating behavior characterized by the increasing resistivity with the
decreasing temperature.

Skyrmionic devices exhibit energy-efficient and high-integration data storage
and computing capabilities due to their small size, topological protection, and
low drive current requirements. So, to realize these devices, an extensive
study, from fundamental physics to practical applications, becomes essential.
In this article, we present an exhaustive review of the advancements in
understanding the fundamental physics behind magnetic skyrmions and the novel
data storage and computing technologies based on them. We begin with an
in-depth discussion of fundamental concepts such as topological protection,
stability, statics and dynamics essential for understanding skyrmions,
henceforth the foundation of skyrmion technologies. For the realization of
CMOS-compatible skyrmion functional devices, the writing and reading of the
skyrmions are crucial. We discuss the developments in different writing schemes
such as STT, SOT, and VCMA. The reading of skyrmions is predominantly achieved
via two mechanisms: the Magnetoresistive Tunnel Junction (MTJ) TMR effect and
topological resistivity (THE). So, a thorough investigation into the Skyrmion
Hall Effect, topological properties, and emergent fields is also provided,
concluding the discussion on skyrmion reading developments. Based on the
writing and reading schemes, we discuss the applications of the skyrmions in
conventional logic, unconventional logic, memory applications, and neuromorphic
computing in particular. Subsequently, we present an overview of the potential
of skyrmion-hosting Majorana Zero Modes (MZMs) in the emerging Topological
Quantum Computation and helicity-dependent skyrmion qubits.

Synthesis is a major challenge in the discovery of new inorganic materials.
There is currently limited theoretical rationale for planning optimal
solid-state synthesis procedures that selectively yield desired targets with
minimal impurities. Using an interface reaction model, we propose two
selectivity metrics -- primary and secondary competition -- to measure the
favorability of target and impurity phase formation in solid-state reactions.
We first apply these metrics to assess the selectivity of 3,520 solid-state
synthesis recipes extracted from the scientific literature, comparing the
thermodynamic optimality of various approaches to popular targets (e.g.,
LiMn$_2$O$_4$, LiFePO$_4$) under our framework. Secondly, we implement these
metrics in a data-driven synthesis planning workflow and test its use in
suggesting synthetic routes to barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$). From an 18-element
chemical reaction network created with first-principles materials thermodynamic
data from the Materials Project, we identify 82,985 synthesis reactions for
BaTiO$_3$ and select nine to test experimentally, characterizing their reaction
pathways using ex post facto synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction over a wide
range of temperatures. Analysis of experimental results indicates that our
proposed selectivity metrics correlate with observed target and impurity
formation. We identify two favorably predicted reactions with unconventional
BaS/BaCl$_2$ and Na$_2$TiO$_3$ precursors that yield BaTiO$_3$ more rapidly and
with fewer impurities than conventional solid-state approaches. Altogether, our
framework serves as a foundation for the predictive synthesis of inorganic
materials, facilitating the optimization of existing synthesis approaches and
the design of syntheses to novel materials, including those that cannot be
easily made from conventional "off-the-shelf" precursors.

The quantum many-body problem is an important topic in condensed matter
physics. To efficiently solve the problem, several methods have been developped
to improve the representation ability of wave-functions. For the
Fermi-Hubbard-type model, the ground energy contains one-body and two-body
correlations. In contrast to the wave-function, the Green function directly
represents the spatio-temporal correlations between multiple sites. In this
work, we propose a backflow correction of the one-body Green function to
improve the ability to capture correlations. Our method is benchmarked on the
spinless $t-V$ model with open boundary conditions and on the Fermi-Hubbard
model with periodic and cylindrical boudary conditions, both on rectangular
lattices. The energies achieved by our method are competitive with or even
lower than those achieved by state-of-the-art methods.

<h3>A link between shape dependent lifetimes and thermal escape in quantum  dots and rings</h3>

Understanding the optical emission characteristics of semiconductor
nanostructures is important when determing their device applicability. The
emission depends on the material and its geometry, but also depends on other
processes such as thermal escape from the nanostructure. Although it is widely
accepted that scattering involving longitudinal optical phonons is the key
process in thermal escape, it remains unclear why some quantum structures
thermally emit excitons and other single charge carriers. To investigate this
phenomena we theoretically determine the energy levels and temperature-lifetime
relationships of quantum dots and rings. We find that replicating the observed
temperature dependence of the exciton lifetime requires both an eigenspectrum
and a thermal escape mechanism which are geometry dependent. This suggests that
geometry may be a significant factor in determining the dominant thermal escape
process in quantum structures.

<h3>MBD+C: how to incorporate metallic character into atom-based dispersion  energy schemes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11855" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11855</a>

<br>
<br>
The dispersion component of the van der Waals (vdW) interaction in
low-dimensional metals is known to exhibit anomalous "Type-C non-additivity"
[Int. J. Quantum Chem. 114, 1157 (2014)]. This causes dispersion energy
behavior, at asymptotically large separations, that is missed by popular
atom-based schemes for dispersion energy calculations. For example, the
dispersion interaction energy between parallel metallic nanotubes at separation
$D$ falls off aymptotically as approximately $D^{-2}$, whereas current
atom-based schemes predict $D^{-5}$ asymptotically. To date it has not been
clear whether current atom-based theories also give the dispersion interaction
inaccurately at smaller separations for low-dimensional metals.
Here we introduce a new theory that we term "MBD+C" . It permits inclusion of
Type C effects efficiently within atom-based dispersion energy schemes such as
Many Body Dispersion (MBD) and Universal MBD (uMBD). This allows us to
investigate asymptotic, intermediate and near-contact regimes with equal
accuracy. (The large contact energy of intimate metallic bonding is not
primarily governed by dispersion energy and is described well by semi-local
density functional theory.) Here we apply a simplified version,"nn-MBD+C", of
our new theory to calculate the dispersion interaction for three
low-dimensional metallic systems: parallel metallic chains of gold atoms,
parallel Li-doped graphene sheets; and parallel (4,4) armchair carbon
nanotubes. In addition to giving the correct asymptotic behavior, the new
theory seamlessly gives the dispersion energy down to near-contact geometry,
where it is similar to MBD but can give up to 15% more dispersion energy than
current MBD schemes, in the systems studied so far. This percentage increases
with separation until nn-MBD+C dominates MBD at asymptotic separations.

The development of accurate methods for determining how alloy surfaces
spontaneously restructure under reactive and corrosive environments is a key,
long-standing, grand challenge in materials science. Current oxidation models,
such as Cabrera-Mott, are based on macroscopic empirical knowledge that lacks
fundamental insight at the atomic level. Using machine learning-accelerated
density functional theory with in situ environmental transmission electron
microscopy (ETEM), we examine the interplay between surface reconstructions and
preferential segregation tendencies of CuNi(100) surfaces under oxidation
conditions. Our modeling approach based on molecular dynamics and grand
canonical Monte Carlo simulations shows that oxygen-induced Ni segregation in
CuNi alloy favors Cu(100)-O c(2x2) reconstruction and destabilizes the
Cu(100)-O missing row reconstruction. The underpinnings of these stabilization
tendencies are rationalized based on the similar atomic coordination and bond
lengths in NiO rock salt and Cu(100)-O c(2x2) structures. In situ ETEM
experiments show Ni segregation followed by NiO nucleation and growth in
regions without MRR, with secondary nucleation and growth of Cu2O in MRR
regions. This further corroborates the simulated surface oxidation and
segregation modelling outcomes. Our findings are general and are expected to
extend to other alloy systems.

Finding viable Kagome lattices is vital for materializing novel phenomena in
quantum materials. In this work, we performed element substitutions on CsV3Sb5
with space group P6/mmm, TbMn6Sn6 with space group P6/mmm, and CsV6Sb6 with
space group R-3 m, respectively, as the parent compounds. A total of 4158
materials were obtained through element substitutions, and these materials were
then calculated via density function theory in high-throughput mode. Afterward,
48 materials were identified with high thermodynamic stability
(E_hull<5meV/atom). Furthermore, we compared the thermodynamic stability of
three different phases with the same elemental composition and predicted some
competing phases that may arise during material synthesis. Finally, by
calculating the electronic structures of these materials, we attempted to
identify patterns in the electronic structure variations as the elements
change. This work provides guidance for discovering promising AM3X5/AM6X6
Kagome materials from a vast phase space.

<h3>Native Pb vacancy defects induced p-type characteristic in epitaxial  monolayer PbSe</h3>

<br>
PbSe, a predicted two-dimensional (2D) topological crystalline insulator
(TCI) in the monolayer limit, possess excellent thermoelectric and infrared
optical properties. Native defects in PbSe take a crucial role for the
applications. However, little attention has been paid to the defect induced
doping characteristics. Here, we provide an experimental and theoretical
investigation of defects induced p-type characteristic on epitaxial monolayer
PbSe on Au(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements demonstrate
an epitaxial PbSe monolayer with a fourfold symmetric lattice. Combined
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations reveal a quasi-particle bandgap of 0.8eV of PbSe. STM results
unveil that there are two types of defects on the surface, one is related the
vacancies of Pb atoms and the other is the replacement of the absent Se atoms
by Pb. Corresponding theoretical optimization confirms the structures of the
defects. More importantly, both STS measurements and DFT calculations give
evidence that the Pb vacancies move the Fermi energy inside the valence band
and produce extra holes, leading to p-type characteristics of PbSe. Our work
provides effective information for the future research of device performance
based on PbSe films.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the quasiparticle dynamics in MnBi2Te4 single crystal using
the ultrafast optical spectroscopy. Our results show that there exist anomalous
dynamical optical responses below the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering
temperature TN. In specific, we reveal that both the initial carrier decay and
recombination processes can be modulated via introducing the AFM order in
sub-picosecond and picosecond timescales, respectively. We also discover a long
relaxation process emerging below TN with a timescale approaching to the
nanosecond regime, and can be attributed to the T-dependent spin-lattice
interaction. There also emerges an unusual phonon energy renormalization below
TN , which is found to arise from its coupling the spin degree via the exchange
interaction and magnetic anisotropy. Our findings provide key information for
understanding the dynamical properties of non-equilibrium carrier, spin and
lattice in MnBi2Te4.

<h3>Dynamics of pinned quantized vortices in superfluid $^4$He in a  microelectromechanical oscillator</h3>

<br>
<i>Tomo Nakagawa, Makoto Tsubota, Keegan Gunther, Yoonseok Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically studied the vortex dynamics at zero temperature in superfluid
$^4$He confined between two parallel rough solid boundaries, one of which
oscillates in a shear mode. This study was motivated by the experimental work
by Barquist $et$ $al.$ which employed a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
oscillator operating in superfluid $^4$He at a near-zero temperature. Their
experiments suggest that the motion of the MEMS oscillator is damped by
quantized vortices. In our study, we postulated that this damping effect was
closely associated with vortex pinning phenomena and developed pinning models
incorporating the dissipation of vortices. Our primary objective is to
understand the vortex dynamics in the presence of pinning and to provide
insight into the experimental observations regarding the damping mechanism. We
confirmed that Kelvin waves were excited in the pinned vortices when the
oscillation frequency of the solid boundary matched with the mode frequency of
the Kelvin wave. Additionally, we examined the formation and evolution of
vortex tangles between the boundaries. The vortex tangle was suppressed in the
presence of pinning, while the absence of pinning allowed to form well
developed vortex tangle resulting in turbulence. Finally, by evaluating the
tension of pinned vortices we extracted the damping force acting on the solid
boundaries.

<h3>Detecting Strain Effects due to Nanobubbles in Graphene Mach-Zehnder  Interferometers</h3>

<i>Nojoon Myoung, Taegeun Song, Hee Chul Park</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the effect of elastic strain on a Mach-Zehnder (MZ)
interferometer created by graphene p-n junction in quantum Hall regime. We
demonstrate that a Gaussian-shaped nanobubble causes detuning of the quantum
Hall conductance oscillations across the p-n junction, due to the
strain-induced local pseudo-magnetic fields. By performing a
machine-learning-based Fourier analysis, we differentiate the
nanobubble-induced Fourier component from the conductance oscillations
originating from the external magnetic fields. We show that the detuning of the
conductance oscillations is due to the altered pathway of quantum Hall
interface channels caused by the strain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields. In the
presence of the nanobubble, a new Fourier component for a magnetic flux
$\Phi_{0}/2$ appears, and the corresponding MZ interferometry indicates that
the enclosed area is reduced by half due to the strain-mediated pathway between
two quantum Hall interface channels. Our findings suggest the potential of
using graphene as a strain sensor for developments in graphene-based device
fabrications and measurements technologies.

Understanding how metal atoms are stabilized on metal oxide supports is
important for predicting the stability of single-atom catalysts. In this study,
we use scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate four catalytically active metals - Platinum,
Rhodium, Nickel and Iridium - on the anatase TiO2(101) surface. The metals were
vapor deposited at room temperature in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, and
also with a background water pressure of 2x10-8 mbar. Pt and Ni exist as a
mixture of adatoms and nanoparticles in UHV at low coverage, with the adatoms
immobilized at defect sites. Water has no discernible effect on the Pt
dispersion, but significantly increases the amount of Ni single atoms. Ir is
highly dispersed, but sinters to nanoparticles in the water vapor background
leading to the formation of large clusters at step edges. Rh forms clusters on
the terrace of anatase TiO2(101) irrespective of the environment. We conclude
that introducing defect sites into metal oxide supports could be a strategy to
aid the dispersion of single atoms on metal-oxide surfaces, and that the
presence of water should be taken into account in the modelling of single-atom
catalysts.

Materials that break time-reversal or inversion symmetry possess
nondegenerate electronic bands, which can touch at so-called Weyl points. The
spinor eigenstates in the vicinity of a Weyl point exhibit a well-defined
chirality $\pm 1$. Numerous works have studied the consequences of this
chirality, for example in unconventional magnetoelectric transport. However,
even a Weyl point with isotropic dispersion is not only characterized by its
chirality but also by the momentum dependence of the spinor eigenstates. For a
single Weyl point, this momentum-space spin structure can be brought into
standard "hedgehog" form by a unitary transformation, but for two or more Weyl
points, this is not possible. In this work, we show that the relative spin
structure of a pair of Weyl points has strong qualitative signatures in the
electromagnetic response. Specifically, we investigate the Friedel oscillations
in the induced charge density due to a test charge for a centrosymmetric system
consisting of two Weyl points with isotropic dispersion. The most pronounced
signature is that the amplitude of the Friedel oscillations falls off as
$1/r^4$ in directions in which both Weyl points exhibit the same spin
structure, while for directions with inverted spin structures, the amplitude of
the Friedel oscillations decreases as $1/r^3$.

Periodic structure of the magnetization reversal (MR) domains is studied
within the superconductor-ferromagnetic-superconductor $\phi_0$-junction model.
The model is described by the Cauchy problem for the system of nonlinear
ordinary equations which is numerically solved by means of the 2-step
Gauss-Legendre method. Two versions of parallel implementation on the basis of
MPI and OpenMP techniques have been developed. Efficiency of both versions is
confirmed by test calculations. An effect of frequency of ferromagnetic

Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a widely used unbiased numerical
method for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, the update
process in DQMC is often a bottleneck for its efficiency. To address this
issue, we propose a generalized delay update scheme that can handle both onsite
and extended interactions. Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both
zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay
update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its
efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC
simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.

<h3>Room-Temperature Highly-Tunable Coercivity and Highly-Efficient  Nonvolatile Multi-States Magnetization Switching by Small Current in Single  2D Ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Room-temperature electrically-tuned coercivity and nonvolatile multi-states
magnetization switching is crucial for next-generation low-power 2D
spintronics. However, most methods have limited ability to adjust the
coercivity of ferromagnetic systems, and room-temperature electrically-driven
magnetization switching shows high critical current density and high power
dissipation. Here, highly-tunable coercivity and highly-efficient nonvolatile
multi-states magnetization switching are achieved at room temperature in
single-material based devices by 2D van der Waals itinerant ferromagnet
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. The coercivity can be readily tuned up to ~98.06% at 300 K by a
tiny in-plane electric field that is 2-5 orders of magnitude smaller than that
of other ferromagnetic systems. Moreover, the critical current density and
power dissipation for room-temperature magnetization switching in 2D
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ are down to ~1.7E5 A cm$^{-2}$ and ~4E12 W m$^{-3}$,
respectively. Such switching power dissipation is 2-6 orders of magnitude lower
than that of other 2D ferromagnetic systems. Meanwhile, multi-states
magnetization switching are presented by continuously controlling the current,
which can dramatically enhance the information storage capacity and develop new
computing methodology. This work opens the avenue for room-temperature
electrical control of ferromagnetism and potential applications for
vdW-integrated 2D spintronics.

<br>
<br>
The application of pressure as well as the successive substitution of Ru with
Fe in the hidden order (HO) compound URu$_2$Si$_2$ leads to the formation of
the large moment antiferromagnetic phase (LMAFM). Here we have investigated the
substitution series URu$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$Si$_2$ from $x$\,=\,0.0 to 2.0 by U\,4$f$
core-level photoelectron spectroscopy and have observed non-monotonic changes
in the spectra. The initial increase and subsequent decrease of the spectral
weight of the 4$f$ core level satellite with increasing $x$ stands for a
non-monotonic 5$f$ filling across the substitution series. The competition of
chemical pressure and increase of the density of states at the Fermi energy,
both due to substitution of Ru with Fe, can explain such a behavior. An
extended Doniach phase diagram including the $x$ dependence of the density of
states is proposed. Also in URu$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$Si$_2$ the ground state is a
singlet or quasi-doublet state consisting of two singlets. Hence, the formation
of magnetic order in the URu$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$Si$_2$ substitution series must be
explained within a singlet magnetism model.

<br>
<br>
The (111) facet of magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$) has been studied extensively by
experimental and theoretical methods, but controversy remains regarding the
structure of its low-energy surface terminations. Using density functional
theory (DFT) computations, we demonstrate three reconstructions that are more
favorable than the accepted Fe$_{\rm oct2}$ termination in reducing conditions.
All three structures change the coordination of iron in the kagome Fe$_{\rm
oct1}$ layer to tetrahedral. With atomically-resolved microscopy techniques, we
show that the termination that coexists with the Fe$_{\rm tet1}$ termination
consists of tetrahedral iron capped by three-fold coordinated oxygen atoms.
This structure explains the inert nature of the reduced patches.

<h3>Parity-protected superconducting qubit based on topological insulators</h3>

<i>Guo-Liang Guo, Han-Bing Leng, Xin Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a novel architecture that utilizes two 0-$\pi$ qubits based on
topological Josephson junctions to implement a parity-protected superconducting
qubit. The topological Josephson junctions provides protection against
fabrication variations, which ensures the identical Josephson junctions
required to implement the0-$\pi$ qubit. By viewing the even and odd parity
ground states of a 0-$\pi$ qubit as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ states, we construct the
logic qubit states using the total parity odd subspace of two 0-$\pi$ qubits.
This parity-protected qubit exhibits robustness against charge noise, similar
to a singlet-triplet qubit's immunity to global magnetic field fluctuations.
Meanwhile, the flux noise cannot directly couple two states with the same total
parity and therefore is greatly suppressed. Benefiting from the simultaneous
protection from both charge and flux noise, we demonstrate a dramatic
enhancement of both $T_1$ and $T_2$ coherence times. Our work presents a new
approach to engineer symmetry-protected superconducting qubits.

<br>
<br>
Atomically precise graphene nanoflakes, called nanographenes, have emerged as
a promising platform to realize carbon magnetism. Their ground state spin
configuration can be anticipated by Ovchinnikov-Lieb rules based on the
mismatch of {\pi}-electrons from two sublattices. While rational geometrical
design achieves specific spin configurations, further direct control over the
{\pi}-electrons offers a desirable extension for efficient spin manipulations
and potential quantum device operations. To this end, we apply a site-specific
dehydrogenation using a scanning tunneling microscope tip to nanographenes
deposited on a Au(111) substrate, which shows the capability of precisely
tailoring the underlying {\pi}-electron system and therefore efficiently
manipulating their magnetism. Through first-principles calculations and
tight-binding mean-field-Hubbard modelling, we demonstrate that the
dehydrogenation-induced Au-C bond formation along with the resulting
hybridization between frontier {\pi}-orbitals and Au substrate states
effectively eliminate the unpaired {\pi}-electron. Our results establish an
efficient technique for controlling the magnetism of nanographenes.

<br>
<br>
Ultracold Fermi gases of spin-3/2 atoms provide a clean platform to realise
SO(5) models of 4-Fermi interactions in the laboratory. By confining the atoms
in a two-dimensional Raman lattice, we show how this system can be used as a
flexible quantum simulator of Dirac quantum field theories (QFTs) that combine
Gross-Neveu and Thirring interactions with a higher-order topological twist. We
show that the lattice model corresponds to a regularization of this QFT with an
anisotropic twisted Wilson mass. This allows us to access higher-order
topological states protected by a hidden SO(5) symmetry, a remnant of the
original rotational symmetry of the 4-Fermi interactions that is not explicitly
broken by the lattice discretization. Using large-$N$ methods, we show that the
4-Fermi interactions lead to a rich phase diagram with various competing
fermion condensates. Our work opens a route for the implementation of
correlated higher-order topological states with tunable interactions that has
interesting connections to non-trivial relativistic QFTs of Dirac fermions in
$D = 2 + 1$ dimensions.

<br>
<br>
Unconventional materials with mismatch between electronic centers and atomic
positions can be diagnosed by symmetry eigenvalues at several high-symmetry $k$
points. Their electronic states are decomposed into a sum of elementary band
representations (EBRs), but not a sum of atomic valence-electron band
representations (ABRs). In this work, we propose a new kind of symmetry
indicator-free (SI-free) unconventional insulators, whose unconventionality has
no symmetry eigenvalue indication. Instead, it is identified directly by the
computed charge centers by using the one-dimensional (1D) Wilson loop method.
We demonstrate that 1T-PtSe$_2$ is an SI-free unconventional insulator, whose
unconventional nature originates from orbital hybridization between Pt-$d$ and
Se-$p_{x,y}$ states. The SI-free unconventionality widely exists in the members
of PtSe$_2$ family ($MX_2$: $M=$ Ni,Pd,Pt; $X=$ S, Se,Te).The obstructed
electronic states are obtained on the edges, which exhibit large Rashba
splitting. By introducing superconducting proximity and external magnetic
field, we propose that the Majorana zero modes (MZM) can be generated on the
corners of 1T-PtSe$_2$ monolayer.

<h3>Rationally Correcting Impurity Levels Positions Based on Electrostatic  Potential Strategy for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</h3>

<br>
<br>
Doping to induce suitable impurity levels is an effective strategy to achieve
highly efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS). However, to
predict the position of impurity levels, it is not enough to only depend on the
projected density of states of the substituted atom in the traditional method.
Herein, taking in phosphorus-doped g-C3N5 as a sample, we find that the
impurity atom can change electrostatic potential gradient and polarity, then
significantly affect the spatial electron density around the substituted atom,
which further adjusts the impurity level position. Based on the redox potential
requirement of POWS, we not only obtain suitable impurity levels, but also
expand the visible light absorption range. Simultaneously, the strengthened
polarity induced by doping further improve the redox ability of photogenerated
carriers. Moreover, the enhanced surface dipoles obviously promote the
adsorption and subsequent splitting of water molecules. Our study provides a
more comprehensive view to realize accurate regulation of impurity levels in
doping engineering and gives reasonable strategies for designing an excellent
catalyst of POWS.

<br>
<br>
Terahertz (THz) field pulses can now be applied in Scanning Tunnelling
Microscopy (THz-STM) junction experiments to study time resolved dynamics. The
relatively slow pulse compared to the typical electronic time-scale calls for
approximations based on a time-scale separation. Here, we contrast three
methods based on non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF): (i) the
steady-state, adiabatic results, (ii) the lowest order dynamic expansion in the
time-variation (DE), and (iii) the auxiliary mode (AM) propagation method
without approximations in the time-variation. We consider a concrete THz-STM
junction setup involving a hydrogen adsorbate on graphene where the localized
spin polarization can be manipulated on/off by a local field from the tip
electrode and/or a back-gate affecting the in-plane transport. We use
steady-state NEGF combined with Density Functional Theory (DFT-NEGF) to obtain
a Hubbard model for the study of the junction dynamics. Solving the Hubbard
model in a mean-field approximation, we find that the near-adiabatic first
order dynamical expansion provides a good description for STM voltage pulses up
to the 1 V range.

<br>
<br>
We experimentally study for the first time the self-heating normal domain in
magnetic field using nanowires made of granular NbTiN films with sub-10~nm
thicknesses. Specifically, we found that at temperatures below 10 K, the heat
capacity of phonons in such films is reduced with respect to predictions of the
Debye model. Moreover, as the temperature decreases, the phonon heat capacity
reduces quicker than the Debye prediction. These effects strengthen when the
film thickness decreases. We attribute the observed reduction in the heat
capacity to the size effect, which arises from the confinement of phonon modes
within the grains; a phenomenon that has been predicted but not yet observed.
These findings hold great importance in understanding the role of heat
transport in superconducting electronic devices and have the potential for
practical applications in mid-infrared photon sensing with superconducting
nanowire detectors.

<h3>Hyperforce balance via thermal Noether invariance of any observable</h3>

We demonstrate that thermally averaged classical phase space functions,
including local and global forces and energies, are associated with exact
hyperforce sum rules that follow from translational Noether invariance. Both
global and locally resolved identities hold and they relate the mean gradient
of a phase space function to its negative correlation with the total force.
Exact hierarchies of higher-body sum rules follow iteratively. As applications
we investigate via computer simulations the emerging one-body force fluctuation
profiles in confined liquids. These local correlators quantify spatially
inhomogeneous self organization and they allow to carry out stringent tests for
sufficient sampling in complex systems.

We consider a classical system of $N$ particles confined in a harmonic trap
in one dimension. The pairwise interaction potential between two particles
separated by a distance $r$ is taken to be power-law form, $ V(r) \sim 1/r^k$
known as Riesz gas. We particularly look at the case where the particles can
interact up to $d$ particles to its left and right if any. By tuning the values
of the parameter $d$, the system can be made from nearest neighbour $(d=1)$ to
all-to-all $(d=N-1)$ interaction model, however the scaling function changes
dramatically as $f$ is changed. Previous studies inform that the collective
theories and the equilibrium densities are different in the two limits. In this
article we study the crossover in density profile by tuning the parameter
$f(=d/N)$ from $1$ to $0$. We find the system size scaling of the density
profile for $f \neq 0$ to be same as it is in the all-to-all coupling case. We
have numerically demonstrated the density-crossover for general $k$ and provide
our analytical understanding in some special values of $k$ e.g., $k=-1$ and $k
\to 0$.

<br>
<i>Lucas Winter, Oded Zilberberg</i>
<br>
<br>
It is commonly believed that light cannot couple to the collective
excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). This assumption
relies on Kohn's theorem that states that electron-electron interactions
decouple from homogeneous electromagnetic fields due to galilean invariance.
Here, we demonstrate that the existence of an edge breaks Kohn's theorem, and
enables coupling of cavity light to the plasmonic edge modes of the FQHE. We
derive the coupling using the FQHE bulk-boundary correspondence and predict the
formation of experimentally detectable plasmon polaritons. We find that a
single cavity mode leaves the system's topological protection intact.
Interestingly, however, a multimode cavity mediates plasmon backscattering, and
effectively transforms the edges of the 2D FQHE into a 1D wire. Such
cavity-meditated nonlocal backscattering bodes the breakdown of the topological
protection in the regime of ultra-strong photon-plasmon coupling. Our
analytical framework and photoelectric findings pave the way for investigating
the topological order of the FQHE via optical spectroscopic probes and provide
new opportunities to control FQHE edge excitations using light.

<i>Ryui Kaneko, Masaya Kunimi, Ippei Danshita</i>
<br>
<br>
We uncover the exact athermal eigenstates in the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model with
a three-body constraint, motivated by the exact construction of quantum
many-body scar (QMBS) states in the $S=1$ XY model. These states are generated
by applying an $\rm SU(2)$ ladder operator consisting of a linear combination
of two-particle annihilation operators to the fully occupied state. By using
the improved Holstein-Primakoff expansion, we clarify that the QMBS states in
the $S=1$ XY model are equivalent to those in the constrained BH model with
additional correlated hopping terms. We also find that, in the strong coupling
limit of the constrained BH model, the QMBS state exists as the lowest-energy
eigenstate of the effective model in the highest-energy sector. This fact
enables us to prepare the QMBS states in a certain adiabatic process and opens
up the possibility of observing them in ultracold-atom experiments.

<h3>Modeling Heat Capacity of Supercritical Fluids: A Phonon Theory Approach</h3>

<i>Yu Liu, Chao Liu</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent research shows that liquids and dense supercritical fluids support
high frequency shear waves. Here, we proposed a general heat capacity model of
supercritical fluids using the latest theoretical findings (the liquid phonon
theory). In this theory, heat capacity cv of supercritical fluids is only
related to the infinite-frequency shear modulus, Debye relaxation time and
minimal length of the longitudinal mode in supercritical fluids rather than the
system-specific structure and interactions. The present model quantitatively
explains the heat capacities in the liquid-like region and the gas-like region
above the critical point. At the same time, the heat capacities of 6
supercritical fluids (including monatomic fluids Ar, Ne and molecular fluids
N2, CO, CO2, CH4) over a wide range of temperatures and pressures were
calculated using the present model, yielding a high accuracy with no
free-fitting parameters. This model has two advantages: (1) The contribution of
intramolecular vibrations was considered, which makes the model applicable to
molecular fluids and high temperature region; (2) This method starts from the
quasi-harmonic Debye model. Thus, it does not require any adjustable parameters
and thermal expansion coefficients. Furthermore, the present cv model of the
rigid liquid-like supercritical region in this paper can be extended to liquid
phase of molecular fluids.

<br>
<br>
Deformation plasticity mechanisms in alloys and compounds may unveil the
material capacity towards optimal mechanical properties. We conduct a series of
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate plasticity mechanisms due to
nanoindentation in pure tungsten, molybdenum and vanadium body-centered cubic
single crystals, as well as the also body-centered cubic, equiatomic, random
solid solutions (RSS) of tungsten--molybdenum and tungsten--vanadium alloys.
Our analysis focuses on a thorough, side-by-side comparison of dynamic
deformation processes, defect nucleation, and evolution, along with
corresponding stress--strain curves. We also check the surface morphology of
indented samples through atomic shear strain mapping. As expected, the presence
of Mo and V atoms in W matrices introduces lattice strain and distortion,
increasing material resistance to deformation and slowing down dislocation
mobility of dislocation loops with a Burgers vector of 1/2 $\langle 111
\rangle$. Our side-by-side comparison displays a remarkable suppression of the
plastic zone size in equiatomic W--V RSS, but not in equiatomic W--Mo RSS
alloys, displaying a clear prediction for optimal hardening response equiatomic
W--V RSS alloys. If the small-depth nanoindentation plastic response is
indicative of overall mechanical performance, it is possible to conceive a
novel MD-based pathway towards material design for mechanical applications in
complex, multi-component alloys.

<br>
<br>
Solution-processable near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors are urgently needed
for a wide range of next-generation electronics, including sensors, optical
communications and bioimaging. However, there is currently a compromise between
low toxicity and slow (<300 kHz cut-off frequency) organic materials versus
faster detectors (>300 kHz cut-off frequency) based on compounds containing
toxic lead or cadmium. Herein, we circumvent this trade-off by developing
solution-processed AgBiS2 photodetectors with high cut-off frequencies under
both white light (>1 MHz) and NIR (approaching 500 kHz) illumination. These
high cut-off frequencies are due to the short transit distances of
charge-carriers in the AgBiS2 photodetectors, which arise from the strong light
absorption of these materials, such that film thicknesses well below 120 nm are
adequate to absorb >65% of near-infrared to visible light. By finely
controlling the thickness of the photoactive layer, we can modulate the
charge-collection efficiency, achieve low dark current densities, and minimize
the effects of ion migration to realize fast photodetectors that are stable in
air. These outstanding characteristics enable real-time heartbeat sensors based
on NIR AgBiS2 photodetectors.

Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of
matter. In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved
that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic
insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic
observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants
has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons
in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular
optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as
extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local
interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic
frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons
around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the
exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly
correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical
simulation.

<h3>Quantum bath augmented stochastic nonequilibrium atomistic simulations  for molecular heat conduction</h3>

Classical molecular dynamics (MD) has been shown to be effective in
simulating heat conduction in certain molecular junctions since it inherently
takes into account some essential methodological components which are lacking
with quantum Landauer-type transport model, such as many-body full force-field
interactions, anharmonicity effects and nonlinear responses for large
temperature biases. However, the classical mechanics reaches its limit in the
environments where the quantum effects are significant (e.g. with
low-temperatures substrates, presence of extremely high frequency molecular
modes). Here, we present an atomistic simulation methodology for molecular heat
conduction that incorporates the quantum Bose-Einstein statistics into an
effective temperature in the form of modified Langevin equation. We show that
the results from such a quasi-classical effective temperature (QCET) MD method
deviates drastically when the baths temperature approaches zero from classical
MD simulations and the results converge to the classical ones when the bath
approaches the high-temperature limit, which makes the method suitable for full
temperature range. In addition, we show that our quasi-classical thermal
transport method can be used to model the conducting substrate layout and
molecular composition (e.g. anharmonicities, high-frequency modes). Anharmonic
models are explicitly simulated via the Morse potential and compared to pure
harmonic interactions, to show the effects of anharmonicities under quantum
colored bath setups. Finally, the chain length dependence of heat conduction is
examined for one-dimensional polymer chains placed in between quantum augmented
baths.
