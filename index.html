<h3>Axisymmetric monopole and dipole flow singularities in proximity of a  stationary no-slip plate immersed in a Brinkman fluid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07669</a>

Green's function plays an important role in many areas of physical sciences
and is a prime tool for solving diverse hydrodynamic equations in the linear
regime. In the present contribution, the axisymmetric low-Reynolds-number
Brinkman flow induced by monopole and dipole singularities in proximity of a
stationary plate of circular shape is theoretically investigated. The flow
singularities are directed along the central axis of the plate. No-slip
boundary conditions are assumed to hold at the surface of the plate. The
Green's functions are determined to a large extent analytically, reducing the
solution of the linear hydrodynamic equations to well-behaved one-dimensional
integrals amenable to numerical computation. In our approach, the Brinkman flow
problem is formulated as a mixed boundary value problem that is subsequently
mapped in the form of dual integral equations on the domain boundaries.
Thereupon, the solution of the equations of fluid motion is eventually reduced
to the solution of two independent Fredholm integral equations of the first
kind. The overall flow structure and emerging eddy patterns are found to
strongly depend on the magnitude of the dimensionless impermeability and
relevant geometrical parameters of the system. Moreover, the effect of the
confining plate on the dynamics of externally driven or force-free particles is
assessed through the calculation of the relevant hydrodynamic reaction
functions. The effect of the plate on the locomotory behavior of a
self-propelling active dipole swimmer is shown to be maximum when the distance
separating the swimmer from the plate is comparable to the radius of the plate.
Our results may prove useful for characterizing transport processes in
microfluidic devices and may pave the way toward understanding and controlling
of small-scale flows in porous media.

<h3>Modeling of the bending of an electroactive pseudo trilayer based on  PEDOT, a semiconductor polymer</h3>

Electroactive polymers (EAP) are smart materials that can be used as
actuators, sensors or energy harvesters in many fields. We had previously
studied an ionic metal-polymer composites (IPMC), which consists in an ionic
polymer film such as Nafion saturated with water and coated on both sides with
a thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is
subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an
actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential
difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a
sensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system. The
thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes had enabled us to establish its
constitutive equations.We are currently interested in a system of close
properties based on PEDOT, a semiconductor EAP. The central part of the device
consists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions
reservoir. The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating
network with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two
outer layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated
with an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric
field orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or
dedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from
the central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the
positive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components
system : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on
the other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic
relations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the
macroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The
thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive
relations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized
Fourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of
a cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant
temperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to
draw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions
near the electrodes. We also evaluated the tip displacement and the force that
must be exerted on the free end of the beam to prevent its displacement
(blocking force). The results obtained are in good agreement with the
experimental data published in the literature.

<h3>Memory Storage and Retrieval in Sparsely Connected Balanced Networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07656" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07656</a>

<i>Enrico Ventura</i>

Ever since the last two decades of the past century pioneering studies in the
field of statistical physics had focused their efforts on developing models of
neural networks that could display memory storage and retrieval. Though many
associative memory models were easy to handle and still quite effective to
explain the basic memory retrieval processes in the brain, they were not
satisfactory under the biological point of view. It became clear to scientists
that a biologically realistic neural network should have respected typical
features that were observed in experiments of neurophysiology. This aspect has
led to the introduction of Balanced Networks, systems where excitatory and
inhibitory neurons balance their effect on each other as an emergent property
of the network dynamics. One of such models is the exhibition of a mean level
of neuronal activity (i.e. the average spiking rate of neurons) that is
univocally defined by a linear equation in the external input. This aspect
might help to reproduce what is measured in particular areas devoted to memory
storage, i.e. a persistent activity during the memory retrieval performance.
Even though progresses in the matter of balanced networks where achieved in the
last two decades, there is still no complete theory that conciliates memory
retrieval and balance in a network of neurons. The aim of this work is to
develop a biologically plausible model that presents both balance and memory
retrieval, building on a framework of mean field equations that can predict the
theoretical behaviour of the network under the choice of a set of control
parameters. We will thus measure the critical capacity of the system as a
function of these parameters, comparing the theoretical results with the
numerical simulations.

<h3>Time-averaged approach to the dewetting problem at evaporation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07659" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07659</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaolong Zhang, Vadim Nikolayev</i>
<br>
<br>
Dewetting of liquid films on solid surfaces in the presence of evaporation is
a common phenomenon and has been studied by many researchers. The previous
numerical approach has revealed that evaporation accelerates the dewetting
speed of the triple contact line and established correlations between the
dewetting speed and the surface wettability and superheating. However, such a
numerical calculation is time- and resource-consuming. ,We examine dewetting
physics and propose a time-averaged approach based on the multiscale theory.
The new approach averages the dewetting process over time and consists of only
several algebraic equations, making the problem easier to solve. It can produce
time-averaged values of essential quantities, such as the dewetting speed and
contact angle as a function of superheating, which agrees with the previous
numerical results. This simple approach is valuable for many applications, such
as modeling pulsating heat pipes and describing the microlayer dynamics under
growing vapor bubbles in nucleate boiling.

<h3>Using Limited Neural Networks to Assess Relative Mechanistic Influence  on Shock Heating in Granular Solids</h3>

<br>
<i>Brenden W Hamilton, Timothy C. Germann</i>
<br>
<br>
The rapid compaction of granular media results in localized heating that can
induce chemical reactions, phase transformations, and melting. However, there
are numerous mechanisms in play that can be dependent on a variety of
microstructural features. Machine learning techniques such as neural networks
offer a ubiquitous method to develop models for physical processes. Limiting
what kinds of microstructural information is used as input and assessing
normalized changes in network error, the relative importance of different
mechanisms can be inferred. Here we utilize binned, initial density information
as network inputs to predict local shock heating in a granular high explosive
trained from large scale, molecular dynamics simulations. The spatial extend of
the density field used in the network is altered to assess the importance and
relevant length scales of the physical mechanisms in play, where different
microstructural features result in different predictive capability.

<br>
<i>Yakov Braver, Egidijus Anisimovas, Krzysztof Sacha</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate the possibility of using time-space crystalline structures to
simulate eight-dimensional systems based on only two physical dimensions. A
suitable choice of system parameters allows us to obtain a gapped energy
spectrum, making topological effects become relevant. The nontrivial topology
of the system is evinced by considering the adiabatic state pumping along
temporal and spatial crystalline directions. Analysis of the system is
facilitated by rewriting the system Hamiltonian in a tight-binding form,
thereby putting space, time, and the additional synthetic dimensions on an
equal footing.

<h3>Modeling hard-soft block copolymers as a liquid crystalline polymer</h3>

<br>
<i>M. Manav, M. Ponga, M. Ortiz</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a new computational approach to model hard-soft block copolymers
like polyurea as a liquid crystalline polymer to understand their
microstructural evolution due to mechanical loading. The resulting
microstructure closely resembles the microstructure observed in polyurea. The
stress-strain relations in uniaxial compression and tension loading obtained
from the model are also in close quantitative agreement with the experimental
data for polyurea. We use the model to elucidate the evolution of the hard and
the soft domains during loading, which is consistent with the experimental
measurements characterizing microstructural evolution in polyurea.

<h3>Quasiuniversality from all-in-all-out Weyl quantum criticality in  pyrochlore iridates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07694" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07694</a>
<br>
<i>David Jonas Moser, Lukas Janssen</i>
<br>
<br>
We identify an exotic quasiuniversal behavior near the all-in-all-out Weyl
quantum critical point in three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, such as the
pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, with $R$ a rare-earth element. The
quasiuniversal behavior is characterized by power laws with exponents that vary
slowly over several orders of magnitude in energy or length. However, in
contrast to the quasiuniversality discussed in the context of deconfined
criticality, the present case is characterized by a genuinely-universal
ultra-low-temperature behavior. In this limit, the pertinent critical exponents
can be computed exactly within a renormalization group analysis. Experimental
implications for the pyrochlore iridates are outlined.

<h3>Charting the space of ground states with tensor networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07700" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07700</a>
<br>
<i>Marvin Qi, David T. Stephen, Xueda Wen, Daniel Spiegel, Markus J. Pflaum, Agnès Beaudry, Michael Hermele</i>
<br>
<br>
We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study
topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many-body
systems. We focus on families of states in one spatial dimension, where each
state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond dimension. Such
states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To
such parametrized families over $X$ we associate a gerbe, which generalizes the
line bundle of ground states in zero-dimensional families (\emph{i.e.} in
few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a
class in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, which is believed to classify one-dimensional
parametrized systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an
obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an MPS tensor that
is continuous everywhere on $X$. We illustrate our construction with two
examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over $X=S^3$ and $X = \mathbb{R}
P^2 \times S^1$. Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the
construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems, with an
example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a
nontrivial 2-gerbe over $X = S^4$.

<h3>Transport of particles through RO membrane in steady state condition</h3>

<br>

Reverse Osmosis(RO) membranes are widespread nowadays for separating the
solvent from a solution. RO membranes are made of polymer matrix. Experiments
show changes in relative interaction of solvent and solute with RO membrane
matrix lead to changes in solvent permeation, solute rejection and fouling.
Here we study microscopically separation of binary mixture through RO polymeric
membrane using Molecular dynamics simulation to rationalize the experimental
observations in terms a simple model. We find better solvent permeation and
solute rejection with increasing interaction between solute and membrane with
increase in fouling of solute inside membrane. We also find that stronger
solvent membrane interaction reduces fouling. However, this leads to poorer
performance of RO in terms of solvent permeation and solute rejection.

<h3>Optimal signal propagation in ResNets through residual scaling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07715" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07715</a>
<br>
<i>Kirsten Fischer, David Dahmen, Moritz Helias</i>
<br>
<br>
Residual networks (ResNets) have significantly better trainability and thus
performance than feed-forward networks at large depth. Introducing skip
connections facilitates signal propagation to deeper layers. In addition,
previous works found that adding a scaling parameter for the residual branch
further improves generalization performance. While they empirically identified
a particularly beneficial range of values for this scaling parameter, the
associated performance improvement and its universality across network
hyperparameters yet need to be understood. For feed-forward networks (FFNets),
finite-size theories have led to important insights with regard to signal
propagation and hyperparameter tuning. We here derive a systematic finite-size
theory for ResNets to study signal propagation and its dependence on the
scaling for the residual branch. We derive analytical expressions for the
response function, a measure for the network's sensitivity to inputs, and show
that for deep networks the empirically found values for the scaling parameter
lie within the range of maximal sensitivity. Furthermore, we obtain an
analytical expression for the optimal scaling parameter that depends only
weakly on other network hyperparameters, such as the weight variance, thereby
explaining its universality across hyperparameters. Overall, this work provides
a framework for theory-guided optimal scaling in ResNets and, more generally,
provides the theoretical framework to study ResNets at finite widths.

<h3>Dirac quantum criticality and the web of dualities</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07718" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07718</a>
<br>
<i>William Witczak-Krempa</i>
<br>
<br>
We grow the web of dualities for conformal field theories (CFTs) in 2+1
spacetime dimensions to include quantum critical transitions of Dirac fermions.
Our construction uses the seed duality, equating a free Dirac fermion with a
complex boson coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field, to express various
Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) critical points of N fermions in terms of the same
number of complex bosons and partner gauge fields. In some instances, monopole
operators appear explicitly in the dual action, such as for the superconducting
transition of a single Dirac fermion, which is a CFT with emergent
supersymmetry. We match phase diagrams, symmetries and their anomalies. By
further gauging certain symmetries, we derive offspring dualities. For example,
starting with the duality for the regular GNY transition of 2 Dirac fermions,
we arrive at the duality between a Neel-to-VBS deconfined quantum critical
point and a gauged-Gross-Neveu transition. Finally, we use a large-N expansion
for monopole operators, and compare with known scaling dimensions in the
simplest single-flavour GNY transition.

<h3>Chiral nematic and fluctuation-induced first-order phase transitions in  AB-stacked kagome bilayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07726" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07726</a>
<br>
<i>A. Zelenskiy, M. L. Plumer, B. W. Southern, M. E. Zhitomirsky, T. L. Moncheskiy</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Hamiltonian on AB-stacked kagome
bilayers at finite temperature. In a large portion of the parameter space, we
observe three transitions upon cooling the system: a crossover from Heisenberg
to the XY chiral paramagnet, Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to a chiral nematic
phase, and a fluctuation-induced first-order transition to an Ising-like phase.
We characterize the properties of phases numerically using Monte Carlo
finite-size analysis. To further explain the nature of the observed phase
transitions, we develop an analytical coarse-graining procedure that maps the
Hamiltonian onto a generalized XY model on a triangular lattice. To leading
order, this effective model includes both bilinear and biquadratic interactions
and is able to correctly predict the two phase transitions. Lastly, we study
the Ising fluctuations at low temperatures and establish that the origin of the
first-order transition stems from the quasi-degenerate ring manifold in the
momentum space.

Using optical magneto-spectroscopy, we investigate the magnetic excitations
of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ in a broad magnetic field range ($0\ \rm{T}\leq B\leq
17.5\ \rm{T}$) at low temperature. Our measurements reveal rich spectra of
in-plane magnetic excitations with a surprisingly large number of modes, even
in the high-field spin-polarized state. Theoretical calculations find that the
Na-occupation disorder in \NCTO plays a crucial role in generating these modes.
Our work demonstrates the necessity to consider disorder in the spin
environment in the search for Kitaev quantum spin liquid states in practicable
materials.

<h3>Entropic stress of grafted polymer chains in shear flow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07737" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07737</a>
<br>
<i>Jan Mees, Thomas C. O'Connor, Lars Pastewka</i>
<br>
<br>
We analyze the shear response of grafted polymer chains in shear flow via
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations confirm that the
shear response is dominated by the brush's outermost correlation volume, which
depends on shear rate at high Weissenberg number. The system's shear stress can
be approximated by the brush's entropic stress. The simulations further reveal
that at low Weissenberg number, the entropic shear stress of grafted chains is
independent of the Weissenberg number. Increasing the Weissenberg number leads
to Wi-dependent behavior: chains first reorient along the shear direction and
elongate at higher Wi. The entropic shear stress increases linearly with
Weissenberg number in this regime. We relate these calculations to experimental
observations on the velocity dependence of brush and hydrogel friction.

<h3>Microscopic Examination of SRF-quality Nb Films through Local Nonlinear  Microwave Response</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07746" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07746</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The performance of superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities is
sometimes limited by local defects. To investigate the RF properties of these
local defects, a near-field magnetic microwave microscope is employed. Local
third harmonic response (P3f) and its temperature-dependence and RF
power-dependence are measured for one Nb/Cu film grown by Direct Current
Magnetron Sputtering (DCMS) and six Nb/Cu films grown by High Power Impulse
Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) with systematic variation of deposition
conditions. Five out of the six HiPIMS Nb/Cu films show a strong third harmonic
response that is likely coming from a low-Tc surface defect with a transition
temperature between 6.3 K and 6.8 K, suggesting that this defect is a generic
feature of air-exposed HiPIMS Nb/Cu films. One possible origin of such a defect
is grain boundaries hosting a low-Tc impurity such as oxidized Nb.
Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations are performed to better
understand the measured third harmonic response. The simulation results show
that the third harmonic response of RF vortex nucleation caused by surface
defects can qualitatively explain the experimental data. Moreover, the density
of surface defects that nucleate RF vortices, and how deep an RF vortex travels
through these surface defects, can be extracted qualitatively from third
harmonic response measurements. From the point of view of these two properties,
the best Nb/Cu film for SRF applications can be identified.

<h3>Small-angle scattering tensor tomography algorithm for robust  reconstruction of complex textures</h3>

The development of small-angle scattering tensor tomography has enabled the
study of anisotropic nanostructures in a volume-resolved manner. It is of great
value to have reconstruction methods that can handle many different
nanostructural symmetries. For such a method to be employed by researchers from
a wide range of backgrounds, it is crucial that its reliance on prior knowledge
about the system is minimized, and that it is robust under various conditions.
Here, we present a method employing band-limited spherical functions to enable
the reconstruction of reciprocal space maps of a wide variety of
nanostructures. This method has been thoroughly tested and compared to existing
methods in its ability to retrieve known reciprocal space maps, as well as its
robustness to changes in initial conditions, using both simulations and
experimental data. The anchoring of this method in a framework of integral
geometry and linear algebra highlights its possibilities and limitations.

Function is dynamic and originates at atomic interfaces. Combining the
degrees of freedom of molecules with the peculiar properties of 2D quantum
materials can create novel functionality. Here, we report the manipulation and
ultrafast imaging of a unidirectional gearing motion in molecules on a 2D
quantum material. To visualize and disentangle the intertwined structural and
electronic dynamics of such a hybrid interface, we record a 'full molecular
movie' by imaging the atomic positions, the evolution of the molecular orbital
wavefunctions and the modification of electronic states of the substrate. In a
multimodal investigation in a single setup, we disentangle dynamics in valence
and core electrons of both the molecule and the surface with femtosecond and
sub-{\aa}ngstr\"om precision. The ultrafast rotational motion is fueled by the
transfer of hot holes into the molecules that results in 'supercharging' of the
film. As hot carriers move through the interface, we track a transient
modification of the frontier molecular orbitals and observe a chiral symmetry
breaking associated with local structural rearrangements. Our calculations show
that the 'supercharging' changes the interfacial potential energy landscape and
triggers the gearing motion. The experiment offers all-in-one imaging of the
electronic, molecular orbital, chemical and structural dynamics during the flow
of charge and energy across the hybrid interface. Our approach provides
detailed dynamical information on the mechanism underlying surface-adsorbed
molecular gears and enables tailoring novel functionalities in hybrid active
matter.

<h3>Rationalizing Euclidean Assemblies of Hard Polyhedra from Tessellations  in Curved Space</h3>

<br>
<br>
Entropic self-assembly is governed by the shape of the constituent particles,
yet a priori prediction of crystal structures from particle shape alone is
non-trivial for anything but the simplest of space-filling shapes. At the same
time, most polyhedra are not space-filling due to geometric constraints, but
these constraints can be relaxed or even eliminated by sufficiently curving
space. We show using Monte Carlo simulations that the majority of hard Platonic
shapes self-assemble entropically into space-filling crystals when constrained
to the surface volume of a 3-sphere. As we gradually decrease curvature to
"flatten" space and compare the local morphologies of crystals assembling in
curved and flat space, we show that the Euclidean assemblies can be categorized
either as remnants of tessellations in curved space (tetrahedra and
dodecahedra) or non-tessellation-based assemblies caused by large-scale
geometric frustration (octahedra and icosahedra).

With the introduction of x-ray free electron laser sources around the world,
new scientific approaches for visualizing matter at fundamental length and
time-scales have become possible. As it relates to magnetism and
"magnetic-type" systems, advanced methods are being developed for studying
ultrafast magnetic responses on the time-scales at which they occur. We
describe three capabilities which have the potential to seed new directions in
this area and present original results from each: pump-probe x-ray scattering
with low energy excitation, x-ray photon fluctuation spectroscopy, and
ultrafast diffuse x-ray scattering. By combining these experimental techniques
with advanced modeling together with machine learning, we describe how the
combination of these domains allows for a new understanding in the field of
magnetism. Finally, we give an outlook for future areas of investigation and
the newly developed instruments which will take us there.

Austenitic 347H stainless steel offers superior mechanical properties and
corrosion resistance required for extreme operating conditions such as high
temperature. The change in microstructure due to composition and process
variations is expected to impact material properties. Identifying
microstructural features such as grain boundaries thus becomes an important
task in the process-microstructure-properties loop. Applying convolutional
neural network (CNN) based deep-learning models is a powerful technique to
detect features from material micrographs in an automated manner. Manual
labeling of the images for the segmentation task poses a major bottleneck for
generating training data and labels in a reliable and reproducible way within a
reasonable timeframe. In this study, we attempt to overcome such limitations by
utilizing multi-modal microscopy to generate labels directly instead of manual
labeling. We combine scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 347H
stainless steel as training data and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
micrographs as pixel-wise labels for grain boundary detection as a semantic
segmentation task. We demonstrate that despite producing instrumentation drift
during data collection between two modes of microscopy, this method performs
comparably to similar segmentation tasks that used manual labeling.
Additionally, we find that na\"ive pixel-wise segmentation results in small
gaps and missing boundaries in the predicted grain boundary map. By
incorporating topological information during model training, the connectivity
of the grain boundary network and segmentation performance is improved.
Finally, our approach is validated by accurate computation on downstream tasks
of predicting the underlying grain morphology distributions which are the
ultimate quantities of interest for microstructural characterization.

Understanding the sticking coefficient $\sigma$, i.e., the probability of an
adatom sticking to a surface, is essential for controlling the stoichiometry
during epitaxial film growth. However, $\sigma$ on monolayer graphene-covered
surfaces and its impact on remote epitaxy are not understood. Here, using
molecular-beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of the magnetic shape memory alloy
Ni$_2$MnGa, we show that the sticking coefficients for metals on
graphene-covered MgO (001) are less than one and are temperature and element
dependent, as revealed by ion backscattering spectrometry (IBS) and energy
dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). This lies in stark contrast with most
transition metals sticking on semiconductor and oxide substrates, for which
$\sigma$ is near unity at typical growth temperatures ($T<800\degree$C). By
initiating growth below $400 \degree$ C, where the sticking coefficients are
closer to unity and wetting on the graphene surface is improved, we demonstrate
epitaxy of Ni$_2$MnGa films with controlled stoichiometry that can be
exfoliated to produce freestanding membranes. Straining these membranes tunes
the magnetic coercive field. Our results provide a route to synthesize
membranes with complex stoichiometries whose properties can be manipulated via
strain.

Atomic monolayers on semiconductor surfaces represent a new class of
functional quantum materials at the ultimate two-dimensional limit, ranging
from superconductors [1, 2] to Mott insulators [3, 4] and ferroelectrics [5] to
quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI) [6, 7]. A case in point is the recently
discovered QSHI indenene [7, 8], a triangular monolayer of indium epitaxially
grown on SiC(0001), exhibiting a $\sim$120meV gap and substrate-matched
monodomain growth on the technologically relevant $\mu$m scale [9]. Its
suitability for room-temperature spintronics is countered, however, by the
instability of pristine indenene in air, which destroys the system along with
its topological character, nullifying hopes of ex-situ processing and device
fabrication. Here we show how indenene intercalation into epitaxial graphene
offers effective protection from the oxidizing environment, while it leaves the
topological character fully intact. This opens an unprecedented realm of
ex-situ experimental opportunities, bringing this monolayer QSHI within
realistic reach of actual device fabrication and edge channel transport.

<h3>Disordering two-dimensional magnet-particle configurations using  bidispersity</h3>

<br>
<br>
In various types of many-particle systems, bidispersity is frequently used to
avoid spontaneous ordering in particle configuration. In this study, the
relation between bidispersity and disorder degree of particle configuration is
investigated. By using magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, magnet particles are
dispersed in a two-dimensional cell without physical contact between them. In
this magnetic system, bidispersity is introduced by mixing large and small
magnets. Then, the particle system is compressed to produce a uniform particle
configuration. The compressed particle configuration is analyzed by using
Voronoi tessellation for evaluating the disorder degree which strongly depends
on bidispersity. Specifically, standard deviation and skewness of the Voronoi
cell area distribution are measured. As a result, we find that the peak of
standard deviation is observed when the numbers of large and small particles
are almost identical. Although the skewness shows non-monotonic behavior, zero
skewness state (symmetric distribution) can be achieved when the numbers of
large and small particles are identical. In this ideally random (disordered)
state, the ratio between pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal Voronoi cells
become roughly identical, while hexagons are dominant in monodisperse (ordered)
condition. The relation between Voronoi cell analysis and the global bond
orientational order parameter is also discussed.

<h3>Floquet Dynamical Decoupling at Zero Bias</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dynamical decoupling (DD) is an efficient method to decouple systems from
environmental noises and to prolong the coherence time of systems. In contrast
to discrete and continuous DD protocols in the presence of bias field, we
propose a Floquet DD at zero bias to perfectly suppress both the zeroth and
first orders of noises according to the Floquet theory. Specifically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of this Floquet DD protocol in two typical
systems including a spinor atomic Bose-Einstein condensate decohered by
classical stray magnetic fields and a semiconductor quantum dot electron spin
coupled to nuclear spins. Furthermore, our protocol can be used to sense
high-frequency noises. The Floquet DD protocol we propose shines new light on
low-cost and high-portable DD technics without bias field and with low
controlling power, which may have wide applications in quantum computing,
quantum sensing, nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging.

We investigate the valley coherence in high and low-quality monolayer MoSe2
by polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. The observed valley
coherence is on the order of 10 % regardless of the sample quality, proving
that the suppression of extrinsic effects does not improve the valley
coherence. The valley decoherence time estimated based on the valley coherence
time and exciton lifetime is sub-picosecond at the longest, which suggests that
intrinsic scattering sources, such as phonons, strongly limit the valley
coherence.

<h3>Temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy and domain wall tuning in  BaTiO3(111)/CoFeB multiferroics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07879</a>
<br>
<i>Robbie G. Hunt, Kévin J. A. Franke, Paul S. Keatley, Philippa M. Shepley, Matthew Rogers, Thomas A. Moore</i>
<br>
<br>
Artificial multiferroics consist of two types of ferroic materials, typically
a ferroelectric and ferromagnet, often coupled interfacially by
magnetostriction induced by the lattice elongations in the ferroelectric. In
BaTiO3 the magnitude of strain induced by these elongations is heavily
temperature dependent, varying greatly between each of the polar crystal phases
and exerting a huge influence over the properties of a coupled magnetic film.
Here we demonstrate that temperature, and thus strain, is an effective means of
controlling the magnetic anisotropy in BaTiO3(111)/CoFeB heterostructures. We
investigate the three polar phases of BaTiO3: tetragonal (T) at room
temperature, orthorhombic (O) below 280 K and rhombohedral (R) below 190 K,
across a total range of 77 K to 420 K. We find two distinct responses; a
step-like change in the anisotropy across the low-temperature phase
transitions, and a sharp high-temperature reduction around the ferroelectric
Curie temperature, measured from hard axis hysteresis loops. Using our
measurements of this anisotropy strength we are then able to show by
micromagnetic simulation the behaviour of all possible magnetic domain wall
states and determine their scaling as a function of temperature. The most
significant changes occur in the head-to-head domain wall states, with a
maximum change of 210 nm predicted across the entire range effectively doubling
the size of the domain wall as compared to room temperature. Notably, similar
changes are seen for both high and low temperatures which suggest different
routes for potential control of magnetic anisotropy and elastically pinned
magnetic domain walls.

Superconducting devices with broken time-reversal and spatial-inversion
symmetries can exhibit novel superconducting phenomena. The observation of
superconducting diode effects, which is applicable for dissipationless
rectification, provides information on the breaking of such symmetries. We
experimentally study a Josephson junction (JJ) coupled to another adjacent JJ
as a new system exhibiting the superconducting diode effect. We demonstrate
that the observed superconducting diode effect can be controlled non-locally
based on the phase difference with the adjacent JJ. These results indicate that
the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a JJ are broken by the
coherent coupling to an adjacent JJ, and this enables the engineering of novel
superconducting phenomena mediated by coherent coupling among JJs and
development of their applications for superconducting diode devices.

<h3>Direct atomic layer deposition of ultra-thin $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and $HfO_{2}$  films on gold-supported monolayer $MoS_{2}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In this paper, the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ultra-thin films (<4 nm)
of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and $HfO_{2}$ on Au-supported monolayer (1L) $MoS_{2}$ is
investigated, providing an insight on the nucleation mechanisms in the early
stages of the ALD process. A preliminary multiscale characterization of large
area 1L-$MoS_{2}$ exfoliated on sputter-grown Au/Ni films revealed an almost
conformal $MoS_{2}$ membrane with the Au topography and the occurrence of
strain variations at the nanoscale. Ab-initio DFT calculations of
$MoS_{2}$/Au(111) interface showed a significant influence of the Au substrate
on the $MoS_{2}$ energy band structure, whereas small differences were
accounted for the adsorption of the $H_{2}O$, TMA and TDMAHf precursors. This
suggests a crucial role of nanoscale morphological effects, such as local
curvature and strain of the $MoS_{2}$ membrane, in the enhanced physisorption
of the precursors. Therefore, the nucleation and growth of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and
$HfO_{2}$ films onto 1L-$MoS_{2}$/Au was investigated, by monitoring the
surface coverage as a function of the number (N) of ALD cycles, with N from 10
to 120. At low N values, a slower growth rate of the initially formed nuclei
was observed for $HfO_{2}$, probably due to the bulky nature of the TDMAHf
precursor as compared to TMA. On the other hand, the formation of continuous
films was obtained in both cases for N>80 ALD cycles, corresponding to 3.6 nm
$Al_{2}O_{3}$ and 3.1 nm $HfO_{2}$. Current mapping by C-AFM showed, for the
same applied bias, a uniform insulating behavior of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and the
occurrence of few localized breakdown spots in the case of $HfO_{2}$,
associated to less compact films regions. Finally, an increase of the
1L-$MoS_{2}$ tensile strain was observed by Raman mapping after encapsulation
with both high-k films, accompanied by a reduction in the PL intensity.

Although developing artificial enzymes has made great progress, there is
still a gap between artificial enzymes and natural enzymes in catalytic
performance. Designing and constructing efficient artificial biocatalysts is
extremely desirable because of their high stability, low cost and easy storage.
Here, we report a synthesized amino-functionalized graphene quantum dots-based
manganese single atom catalyst (SAC) Mn-N4, which exhibits POD-, CAT, SOD-like
activities, especially the superior SOD-like activity. Recent studies have
reported Mn-based SAzymes, however, the multi-enzyme mimicking catalytic
mechanisms for Mn-N4 are not comprehensive and in-depth enough. Therefore, we
combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML)
to validate the performance of the multi-enzyme mimicking activities. The DFT
simulations show that Mn-N4 owns a highly effective SOD in the "one-side
adsorption" with a very low energy barrier of 0.077 eV, which can be attributed
to variation of the preferred spin states of Mn-O2.- system and its "spin
flip-collection lock" in the SOD-like catalytic procedure. Furthermore, spin
related charge distributions on Mn-N4 configurations by machine learning (ML)
analysis suggest that the pattern of spin and natural charge/valence electron
distribution will exhibit similarity in the structures of multiple intermediate
steps of multi-enzyme mimicking activities. This work not only puts forward the
catalytic mechanisms of Mn-N4 SAzymes, but also provides essential guidance for
future design of highly performance artificial enzymes.

Complicated S-Au interaction patterns in thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters
(TP-AuNCs) are important in the formation of versatility among clusters. In
this study, the ELFnet, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model is
trained and tested to bridge the electron localization function (ELF) images
and the bond lengths. As believed to be a successful bond describer, a dataset
of 3959 ELF images is obtained out of Density Functional Theory (DFT)
simulations, followed by a series of model architecture and hyperparameter
exploration. The ELFnet with its best performance shows its correct feature
extraction ability to gain insights in the prediction of bond lengths. Besides,
the ELFnet also possess 3 different "ELF reading modes" which inspires other
possibilities in understanding ELF images. The ELFnet serves as an "ELF-ruler"
to give precise bond type labels (or the predicted bond lengths). Such
ELF-ruler measured bond types represent a particular bond when distorted by
external factors with a quantitative indicator. With the help of such an
ELF-ruler, the classification of chemical bonds in general may be extended to
more precise types.

Optically active point defects in semiconductors have received great
attention in the field of solid-state quantum technologies. Hexagonal boron
nitride, with an ultra-wide band gap E_g = 6 eV, containing a negatively
charged boron vacancy (V_B^-) with unique spin, optical, and coherent
properties presents a new two-dimensional platform for the implementation of
quantum technologies. This work establishes the value of V_B^ - spin
polarization under optical pumping with {\lambda}ext = 532 nm laser using
high-frequency ({\nu}mw = 94 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy. In optimal conditions polarization was found to be P = 38.4 %.
Our study reveals that Rabi oscillations induced on polarized spin states
persist for up to 30-40 microseconds, which is nearly two orders of magnitude
longer than what was previously reported. Analysis of the coherent
electron-nuclear interaction through the observed electron spin echo envelope
modulation (ESEEM) made it possible to detect signals from remote nitrogen and
boron nuclei, and to establish a corresponding quadrupole coupling constant Cq
= 180 kHz related to nuclear quadrupole moment of 14N. These results have
fundamental importance for understanding spin properties of boron vacancy.

We study the Langevin dynamics for spherical $p$-spin models, focusing on the
short time regime described by the Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations. Confirming a
1999 conjecture of Biroli, we show the asymptotic energy achieved is exactly
$E_{\infty}(p)=2\sqrt{\frac{p-1}{p}}$ in the low temperature limit. The upper
bound uses hardness results for Lipschitz optimization algorithms and applies
for all temperatures. For the lower bound, we prove the dynamics reaches and
stays above the lowest energy of any approximate local maximum. In fact the
latter behavior holds for any Hamiltonian obeying natural smoothness estimates,
even with disorder-dependent initialization and on exponential time-scales.

We simulate the magnetization dynamics of a permalloy spheroid of nanoscopic
size in zero external field, such that both dipolar and exchange interactions
are important. Low excitation power is used to obtain the frequencies and mode
patterns of many normal modes. At higher power, non-linear three and four mode
couplings between magnons carrying orbital angular momentum are observed to
give rise to Suhl instabilities. Suhl's analysis of the selection rules
governing the allowed processes is extended to initial states other than
uniform precession. These rules are studied and confirmed by the simulations.
Both down- and up-conversion are seen as well as three and four-mode processes.
General trends are inferred for preferred instabilities among those that are
allowed, although the thresholds for some instabilities appear to be very high.

Intricate nature of magnetism in uranium-based Kondo lattices is a
consequence of correlations between U-5$f$ and conduction electrons. Using
linearized quasiparticle self-consistent GW plus dynamical mean-field theory,
we demonstrate a crossover from incoherent to coherent $f$-$d$ Kondo cloud in
the paramagnetic phase of UTe$_2$ with reduced volumes, USbTe and USbSe. As the
transition occurs, we observe an augmented $f$-$d$ coherence and Pauli-like
magnetic susceptibility, with a substantial frozen magnetic moment of U-5$f$
persisting. We show that momentum dependent $f$-$d$ hybridization is
responsible for the magnetic moments arising from the renormalized $f$
electrons' van Hove singularity. Our findings provide a unique perspective to
explain the dual nature of magnetism and the long-range magnetic ordering
induced by pressure in UTe$_2$.

Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of thermal gradient (G) at and
velocity (R) of the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces is critical for
the control of site-specific microstructures in additive manufacturing. In-situ
dynamic x-ray radiography (DXR) has been used in recent years to probe the
evolution of R with high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the current
methods used to measure the temperature (and therefore, G) are inadequate for
sub-melt-pool surface measurement (e.g. thermography) or have lower resolution
or limited field-of-view (e.g. x-ray diffraction). In this study, we
demonstrate a novel approach to estimate the sub-surface temperature
distribution and its time evolution with significantly higher resolutions using
DXR data. This methodology uses the Beer-Lambert's law as a physical basis and
is demonstrated using an in-situ laser spot-melting experiment on Ti-6Al-4V
alloy.

By using band structure calculations of quantum mechanical theory, some
important peaks of DoS (Density of States) were obtained and classified based
on crystal structure laws of cuprate superconductivity. In particular, the
orbital interactions of the in-plane and out-of-plane ions of the copper-oxygen
plane were investigated. The position, half-width, and height of DOS peak
features were collected for all 35 typical curate systems which have critical
temperature maximum data from the works of literature. By training test of 7
common machine learning algorithms, the relationship between the Tc maximum
values and these orbital interaction parameters were mined. It was found that
the key features of the orbital interaction affecting the Tc maximum were not
only the flat band but also a new interaction between core orbitals in a deeper
energy band position.

High-pressure structural search was performed on the hydrogen-rich compound

that exhibits stability and superconductivity above 100 GPa. Our phonon
dispersion, electronic band structure, and superconductivity analyses in the

with a superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 255 K at 200 GPa and a
maximum $T_c$ of 355 k at 100 GPa. Our research has demonstrated the

This study investigates the structural transitions of $\eta \leftrightarrow

Si, Ge) and Au$_4$SSe induced by strain. We focus on Au$_2$S monolayers, which
can form multiple meta-stable monolayers theoretically, including
$\eta$-Au$_2$S, a buckled penta-monolayer composed of a square Au lattice and S
adatoms. The $\theta$-Au$_2$S is regarded as a distorted structure of
$\eta$-Au$_2$S. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a
generalized gradient approximation, the conduction band and the valence band of
$\theta$-Au$_2$S intersect at the $\Gamma$ point, leading to linear dispersion,
whereas $\eta$-Au$_2$S has a band gap of 1.02 eV. The conduction band minimum
depends on the specific Au-Au bond distance, while the valence band maximum
depends on both Au-S and Au-Au interactions. The band gap undergoes significant
changes during the $\eta \leftrightarrow \theta$ phase transition of Au$_2$S
induced by applying tensile or compressive strain to the lattice. Moreover,
substituting S atoms with other elements alters the electronic band structures,
resulting in a variety of physical properties without disrupting the
fundamental Au lattice network. Therefore, the family of Au$_2$X monolayers
holds potential as materials for atomic scale network devices.

<h3>Cavity magnonics with easy-axis ferromagnet: critically enhanced magnon  squeezing and light-matter interaction</h3>

<br>
Generating and probing the magnon squeezing is an important challenge in the
field of quantum magnonics. In this work, we propose a cavity magnonics setup
with an easy-axis ferromagnet to address this challenge. To this end, we first
establish a mechanism for the generation of magnon squeezing in the easy-axis
ferromagnet and show that the magnon squeezing can be critically enhanced by
tuning an external magnetic field near the Ising phase transition point. When
the magnet is coupled to the cavity field, the effective cavity-magnon
interaction becomes proportional to the magnon squeezing, allowing one to
enhance the cavity-magnon coupling strength using a static field. We
demonstrate that the magnon squeezing can be probed by measuring the frequency
shift of the cavity field. Moreover, a magnonic superradiant phase transition
can be observed in our setup by tuning the static magnetic field, overcoming
the challenge that the magnetic interaction between the cavity and the magnet
is typically too weak to drive the superradiant transition. Our work paves the
way to develop unique capabilities of cavity magnonics that goes beyond the
conventional cavity QED physics by harnessing the intrinsic property of a
magnet.

Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots are robust emitters implemented in
numerous prototype and commercial optoelectronic devices. However, active
fluorescence color tuning, achieved so far by electric-field induced Stark
effect, has been limited to a small spectral range, and accompanied by
intensity reduction due to the electron-hole charge separation effect.
Utilizing quantum dot molecules that manifest two coupled emission centers, we
present a novel electric-field induced instantaneous color switching effect.
Reversible emission color switching without intensity loss is achieved on a
single particle level, as corroborated by correlated electron microscopy
imaging. Simulations establish that this is due to the electron wavefunction
toggling between the two centers dictated by the electric-field and affected by
the coupling strength. The quantum dot molecules manifesting two coupled
emission centers may be tailored to emit distinct colors, opening the path for
sensitive field sensing and color switchable devices such as a novel pixel
design for displays or an electric field color tunable single photon source.

<h3>Systematic study of amorphous 2D graphene, silicene and silicon carbide:  Investigation of structural, electronic, optical and vibrational properties</h3>

<i>Emel Gürbüz, Biplab Sanyal</i>
<br>
<br>
Although 2D solids and their vdW heterostructures have garnered much
attention recently, their amorphous forms have been less explored. We present a
detailed analysis of the structural, electronic, and thermal properties of 2D
amorphous graphene (A-Gra), silicene (A-Si), and silicon carbide (A-SiC) using
Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and first-principles
calculations. Our results showed that A-Gra is planar at 0 K and wrinkled at
300 K, like its crystalline counterpart. At both temperatures, it can form
stable vdW solids while maintaining metallic behavior. We also demonstrate that
A-Si creates covalent bonds in layered structures while keeping its
metallicity. Its optical spectrum is blue-shifted in parallel polarization
relative to crystalline silicene, and its plasmon peak is in the UV range with
six-times higher intensity. Furthermore, we show that 2D silicon carbide can be
stabilized as a single layer or in layered structures with bonding between Si
atoms only. A-SiC's plasmon peak is in the UV range. All three structures'
optical spectra are observed as red-shifted compared to their crystalline
counterparts, and their absorption spectra range from IR to UV. Their common
heat carriers are extendons, especially diffusions, and their thermal
conductivity is calculated to be lower than that of their crystalline
counterparts. Our findings suggest that the uneven charge distributions around
local ring structures in all three systems can be exploited in future
electronic, thermo-electric, and opto-electronic devices with local
functionality.

<h3>Electronic instability in pressured black phosphorus under strong  magnetic field</h3>

<br>
<i>Zhong-Yi Wang, Da-Yong Liu, Liang-Jian Zou</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper we have systematically studied the electronic instability of
pressured black phosphorous (BP) under strong magnetic field. We first present
an effective model Hamiltonian for pressured BP near the Lifshitz point. We
show that when the magnetic field exceeds a certain critical value, the
nodal-line semimetal (NLSM) state of BP with a small band overlap re-enters
semiconductive phase by re-opening a small gap. This results in a narrow-band
semiconductor with a partially flat valence band edge. We show that above this
critical magnetic field, two possible instabilities, i.e., charge density wave
(CDW) phase or excitonic insulator (EI) phase, are predicted as the ground
state for high and low doping concentrations, respectively. By comparing our
results with the experiment, we suggest the field-induced instability observed
in recent experiment as EI. Furthermore, we propose that the semimetallic BP
under pressure with small band overlaps may provide a good platform to study
the magneto-exciton insulators. Our findings bring the first insight into the
electronic instability of topological NLSM in the quantum limit.

<h3>Non-divergent Chiral Charge Pumping in Weyl Semimetal</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08149</a>
<br>
<i>Min Ju Park, Suik Cheon, Hyun-Woo Lee</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent studies suggest that the nonlinear transport properties in Weyl
semimetal may be a measurable consequence of its chiral anomaly. Nonlinear
responses in transport are estimated to be substantial, because in real
materials such as TaAs or Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$, the Fermi level resides near the
Weyl nodes where the chiral charge pumping is said to diverge. However, this
work presents semiclassical Boltzmann analysis that indicates that the chiral
charge pumping is non-divergent even at the zero-temperature limit. We
demonstrate that the divergence in common semiclassical calculation scheme is
not a problem of the scheme itself, but occurs because a commonly-used
approximation of the change in particle number breaks down near the Weyl nodes.
Our result suggests the possibility that the nonlinear properties in WSMs can
be overestimated, and provides the validity condition for the conventional
approximation. We also show the distinct Fermi level dependencies of the chiral
magnetic effect and the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, as a
consequence of non-diverging chiral charge pumping.

The aspects of the group velocity and the electromagnetic energy transport
for a dielectric medium endowed with magnetic conductivity are discussed. The
dispersion relations and the correspondent optical effects are examined for
isotropic and anisotropic magnetic conductivity tensors. The group and energy
velocities are presented and carried out for all the particular cases
addressed. Our results state that a dielectric supporting magnetic current
breaks the usual equivalence between group velocity and energy velocity that
holds in a non-absorbing medium, while establish the equivalence between them

We present an extension of the distinguishable-particle lattice model (DPLM)
to three dimensions (3D) and explore comprehensively the glassy dynamics of
such systems. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we found that
the 3D DPLM exhibits many typical glassy behaviors, such as plateaus in the
mean square displacement of particles and the self-intermediate scattering
function, dynamic heterogeneity, variability of glass fragilities, and so on.
The observed glassy behaviors of 3D DPLM appear similar to its 2D counterpart,
in accordance with recent findings in molecular models of glasses. The
simulation results obtained in this study will also benefit further theoretical
developments for a more comprehensive understanding of dynamics in structural
glasses.

The recently introduced topological heavy fermion model (THFM) provides a
means for interpreting the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom of the
magic angle twisted bilayer graphene as hybridization amidst highly dispersing
topological conduction and weakly dispersing localized heavy fermions. In order
to understand the Landau quantization of the ensuing electronic spectrum, a
generalization of THFM to include the magnetic field B is desired, but
currently missing. Here we provide a systematic derivation of the THFM in B and
solve the resulting model to obtain the interacting Hofstadter spectra for
single particle charged excitations. While naive minimal substitution within
THFM fails to correctly account for the total number of magnetic subbands
within the narrow band i.e. its total Chern number, our method --based on
projecting the light and heavy fermions onto the irreducible representations of
the magnetic translation group-- reproduces the correct total Chern number.
Analytical results presented here offer an intuitive understanding of the
nature of the (strongly interacting) Hofstadter bands.

<h3>Fixing the flux: A dual approach to computing transport coefficients</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08224" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08224</a>
<br>
<i>Noé Blassel, Gabriel Stoltz</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a method to compute transport coefficients in molecular dynamics.
Transport coefficients quantify the linear dependencies of fluxes in
non-equilibrium systems subject to small external forcings. Whereas standard
non-equilibrium approaches fix the forcing and measure the average flux induced
in the system driven out of equilibrium, a dual philosophy consists in fixing
the value of the flux, and measuring the average magnitude of the forcing
needed to induce it. A deterministic version of this approach, named Norton
dynamics, was studied in the 1980s by Evans and Morris. In this work, we
introduce a stochastic version of this method, first developing a general
formal theory for a broad class of diffusion processes, and then specializing
it to underdamped Langevin dynamics, which are commonly used for molecular
dynamics simulations. We provide numerical evidence that the stochastic Norton
method provides an equivalent measure of the linear response, and in fact
demonstrate that this equivalence extends well beyond the linear response
regime. This work raises many intriguing questions, both from the theoretical
and the numerical perspectives.

<br>
A key advantage of utilizing van der Waals materials as defect-hosting
platforms for quantum applications is the controllable proximity of the defect
to the surface or the substrate for improved light extraction, enhanced
coupling with photonic elements, or more sensitive metrology. However, this
aspect results in a significant challenge for defect identification and
characterization, as the defect's optoelectronic properties depend on the
specifics of the atomic environment. Here we explore the mechanisms by which
the environment can influence the properties of carbon impurity centres in
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We compare the optical and electronic properties
of such defects between bulk-like and few-layer films, showing alteration of
the zero-phonon line energies, modifications to their phonon sidebands, and
enhancements of their inhomogeneous broadenings. To disentangle the various
mechanisms responsible for these changes, including the atomic structure,
electronic wavefunctions, and dielectric screening environment of the defect
center, we combine ab-initio calculations based on a density-functional theory
with a quantum embedding approach. By studying a variety of carbon-based
defects embedded in monolayer and bulk hBN, we demonstrate that the dominant
effect of the change in the environment is the screening of the density-density
Coulomb interactions within and between the defect orbitals. Our comparative
analysis of the experimental and theoretical findings paves the way for
improved identification of defects in low-dimensional materials and the
development of atomic scale sensors of dielectric environments.

<h3>Tunable helical crystals</h3>

We consider a superlattice formed by tunnel-connected identical holes,
periodically placed in a two-dimensional topological insulator. We study
tunneling transport through helical edges of these holes and demonstrate that
the band structure of such helical crystal can be controlled by both gate
electrodes and external magnetic filed. For integer and half-integer values of
dimensionless magnetic flux through the holes, the spectrum possesses Dirac
points whose positions and velocities can be tuned by gates. The deviation of
magnetic flux from these special values by $\delta \phi$ opens gaps in the
Dirac cones, with the gap value $\Delta \propto |\delta \phi|$. At certain
gate-dependent values of $\delta \phi$ different Dirac points merge to a double
Dirac point and then disappear with further increase of $\delta \phi.$
Interaction between carriers may lead to strong renormalization of parameters
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ controlling total tunnel coupling between holes and spin
flip tunneling processes, respectively. We plot the renormalization flow in the
plane $(\alpha,\beta)$ and demonstrate multicritical behaviour of the crystal -
there is a multicritical fully unstable fixed point separating three different
phases: independent rings, independent shoulders, and perfect spin-flip
channels. We also find that defects in the crystal may lead to a formation of
topologically protected qubits which are not destroyed by temperature and can
be also manipulated both by gates and by magnetic field. The possibility of
purely electrical high-temperature control of the qubits opens a wide avenue
for applications in the area of quantum computing.

We discuss the use of commercial high-power light emitting diodes (LEDs) as a
light source for fluorescence pressure measurements. A relatively broad light
emitting spectra of single color LEDs (in comparison with lasers) do not
prevent producing narrow fluorescence lines at least for two widely used
pressure indicator materials, namely ruby (Cr$^{3+}$:Al$_2$O$_3$) and strontium
tetraborate (Sm$^{2+}$:SrB$_4$O$_7$). Strongest responses of both pressure
indicators were detected for the green color LEDs with the average wavelength
$\lambda_{\rm av}\sim 530$ nm. LEDs might be easily implemented for producing
fiber coupled, as well as the parallel light sources. LEDs were found to be
efficient to replace laser sources in piston-cylinder cell and diamond anvil
cell fluorescence pressure measurement setups.

Critical end points and tricritical points are multicritical points that
separate lines of continuous transitions from lines of first order transitions
in the phase diagram of many systems. In models like the spin-1 disordered
Blume-Capel model and the repulsive Blume-Emery-Griffiths model, the
tricritical point splits into a critical end point and a bicritical end point
with an increase in disorder and repulsive coupling strength respectively. In
order to make a distinction between these two multicritical points, we
investigate and contrast the behaviour of the first order phase boundary and
the co-existence diameter around them.

Optimizing solution-processed organic solar cells is a complex task due to
the vast parameter space in organic photovoltaics (OPV). Classical Edisonian or
one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) optimization approaches are laborious,
time-consuming, and may not find the optimal parameter set in multidimensional
design spaces. To tackle this problem, we demonstrate here for the first time
artificial intelligence (AI) guided closed-loop autonomous optimization for
fully functional organic solar cells. We empower our LineOne, an automated
materials and device acceleration platform with a Bayesian Optimizer (BO) to
enable autonomous operation for solving complex optimization problems without
human interference. The system is able to fabricate and characterize complete
OPV devices and navigate efficiently through the design space spanned by
composition and processing parameters. In addition, a Gaussian Progress
Regression (GPR) based early prediction model is employed to predict the
efficiency of the cells from cheap proxy measurements, in our case, thin film
absorption spectra, which are analyzed using a spectral model based on physical
properties to generate microstructure features as input for the GPR. We
demonstrate our generic and complete autonomous approach by optimizing
composition and processing conditions of a ternary OPV system (PM6:Y12:PC70BM)
in a four-dimensional parameter space. We identify the best parameter set for
our system and obtain a precise objective function over the whole parameter
space with a minimal number of samples. We demonstrate autonomous optimization
of a complex opto-electronic device within 40 samples only, whereas an
Edisonian approach would have required about 1000 samples. This raises an
important discussion on the necessity of autonomous platforms to accelerate
Material science.

<br>
<br>
Recent experimental studies have demonstrated the possibility of utilizing
strong terahertz pulses to manipulate individual ferroic orders on pico- and
femtosecond timescales. Here, we extend these findings and showcase the
simultaneous manipulation of multiple ferroic orders in BiFeO$_3$, a material
that is both ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic at room temperature. We find a
concurrent enhancement of ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic second-harmonic
generation (SHG) following the resonant excitation of a high-frequency
fully-symmetric phonon mode. Based on first-principles calculations and
phenomenological modeling, we ascribe this observation to the inherent coupling
of the two ferroic orders to the nonequilibrium distortions induced in the
crystal lattice by nonlinearly driven phonons. Our finding highlights the
potential of nonlinear phononics as a technique for manipulating multiple
ferroic order parameters at once. In addition, this approach provides a
promising avenue to studying the dynamical magnetization and polarization
behavior, as well as their intrinsic coupling, on ultrashort timescales.

<br>
We investigate the correlated state of Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ using neutron
scattering, finding signatures of correlations of both dipolar and octupolar
character. A dipolar inelastic signal is also observed, as expected for spinons
in a quantum spin ice (QSI). Fits of thermodynamic data using exact
diagonalization methods indicate that the largest interaction is an octupolar
exchange, with a strength roughly twice as large as other terms. This hierarchy
of exchange interactions - far from a perturbative regime but still in the
octupolar QSI phase - rationalises observations in neutron scattering, which
illustrate the multipolar nature of degrees of freedom in Ce$^{3+}$
pyrochlores.

<h3>Response of the Verwey transition in magnetite to a controlled  point-like disorder induced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08276" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08276</a>
<br>
<i>Ruslan Prozorov, Makariy A. Tanatar, Erik I. Timmons, Marcin Konczykowski, Tanya Prozorov</i>
<br>
<br>
A controlled point-like disorder induced by low temperature 2.5 MeV electron
irradiation was used to probe the nature of the Verwey transition in magnetite,
$\text{Fe}_{3}\text{O}_{4}$. Two large single crystals, one with optimal
transition temperature, $T_{V}\approx121$ K, and another with $T_{V}\approx109$
K, as well as biogenic nanocrystals, $T_{V}\approx110$ K, were examined.
Temperature-dependent resistivity is consistent with the
semiconductor-to-semiconductor sharp, step-like Verwey transition from a state
with a small bandgap of around 60 meV to a state with a larger bandgap of about
300 meV. The irradiation causes an up-shift of the resistivity curves above the
transition without transition smearing or broadening. It also causes an
apparent down-shift of the resistivity maximum at high temperatures. In the
lower $T_{V}$ crystal, the electron irradiation drives the transition
temperature into a ``forbidden" regime believed to separate the first order
from the second order phase transition. Contrary to this belief, the transition
itself remains sharp and hysteretic without a significant change in the
hysteresis width. We conclude that the sudden change of the bandgap accompanied
by the monoclinic distortion and the change of magnetic anisotropy is the
reason for the Verwey transition in magnetite and the effect of additional
disorder is mostly in the smearing of the sharp gap edges near the Fermi level.

The theoretical applications of hyperbolic metamaterials have generated
excitement in multiple fields, particularly in super-resolution optics. In
practice, however, the potential of HMMs has been limited by the shortcomings
of their constituent parts. Primarily, these are high losses and instabilities
in the metal component, which is typically gold or silver, and excessive
thickness in both types of layers. In this paper, we use density functional
theory to investigate BaMoO3-SrHfO3 metamaterials. We predict that these are
hyperbolic throughout the visible range and have the potential to mitigate many
of these limitations, including a significant loss reduction. We also examine
the accuracy of the effective-medium theory, which is used to predict the bulk
optical properties of multilayered HMMs.

Design of epitaxial interfaces is a pivotal way to engineer artificial
structures where new electronic phases can emerge. Here we report a systematic
emergence of interfacial superconducting state in epitaxial heterostructures of
LaTiO3 and KTaO3. The superconductivity transition temperature increases with
decreasing the thickness of LaTiO3. Such behavior is observed for both (110)
and (111) crystal oriented structures. For thick samples, the finite resistance
developing below the superconducting transition temperature increases with
increasing LaTiO3 thickness. Consistent with previous reports, the (001)
oriented heterointerface features high electron mobility of 250 cm2/Vs and
shows no superconducting transition down to 40 mK. Our results imply a
non-trivial impact of LaTiO3 on the superconducting state and indicate how
superconducting KTaO3 interfaces can be integrated with other oxide materials.

We report on the post-growth shaping of free-standing 2D InAs nanofins that
are grown by selective-area epitaxy and mechanically transferred to a separate
substrate for device fabrication. We use a citric acid based wet etch that
enables complex shapes, e.g., van der Pauw cloverleaf structures, with
patterning resolution down to 150 nm as well as partial thinning of the nanofin
to improve the gate response. We exploit the high sensitivity of the cloverleaf
structures to transport anisotropy to address the fundamental question of
whether there is a measurable transport anisotropy arising from
wurtzite/zincblende polytypism in 2D InAs nanostructures. We demonstrate a
mobility anisotropy of order 2-4 at room temperature arising from polytypic
stacking faults in our nanofins. Our work highlights a key materials
consideration for devices featuring self-assembled 2D III-V nanostructures
using advanced epitaxy methods.

Higher-order topological band theory has transformed the landscape of
topological phases in quantum and classical systems. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate a two-dimensional (2D) higher-order topological phase (HOTP),
referred to as the multiple chiral topological phase (MCTP), which is protected
by a multipole chiral number (MCN). Our realization differs from previous HOTPs
in that it possesses a larger-than-unity MCN, which arises when the
nearest-neighbor couplings (NNCs) are weaker than long-range couplings (LRCs).
Our phase has an MCN of 4, protecting the existence of 4 mid-gap topological
corner modes (TCMs) at each corner. The multiple TCMs demonstrated here could
lead to enhanced quantum-inspired devices for sensing and computing. Our study
also highlights the rich and untapped potential of LRC manipulation for future
research in topological phases.

<br>
<br>
We theoretically investigate effects of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on an
electric-field-driven sliding motion of a one-dimensional charge-density-wave
(CDW) which is initially pinned by impurities. By numerically analyzing an
extended Fukuyama-Lee-Rice model, we show that a mechanical vibration of the
SAW, which, in the model, is assumed to affect the CDW via the pinning site in
the form of temporally oscillating pinning-parameters, induces Shapiro steps
with self-similarity, i.e., the devil's staircase, in the current-voltage
characteristics. It is also found that when the SAW acts as the vibration in
the pinning strength, the mode-locking mechanism leading to the occurrence of
the Shapiro steps is modified, and as a result, the fractal dimension and
parameter dependence of the SAW-induced staircase can be considerably different
from those for the conventional ac-electric-field-induced one. This suggests
that an unconventional type of fractal phenomena can emerge in the SAW-induced
CDW dynamics.

We theoretically investigate a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type
superfluid phase transition in a driven-dissipative two-component Fermi gas.
The system is assumed to be in the non-equilibrium steady state, which is tuned
by adjusting the chemical potential difference between two reservoirs that are
coupled with the system. Including pairing fluctuations by extending the
strong-coupling theory developed in the thermal-equilibrium state by Nozieres
and Schmitt-Rink to this non-equilibrium case, we show that a non-equilibrium
FFLO (NFFLO) phase transition can be realized without spin imbalance, under the
conditions that (1) the two reservoirs imprint a two-edge structure on the
momentum distribution of Fermi atoms, and (2) the system is loaded on a
three-dimensional cubic optical lattice. While the two edges work like two
Fermi surfaces with different sizes, the role of the optical lattice is to
prevent the NFFLO long-range order from destruction by NFFLO pairing
fluctuations. We also draw the non-equilibrium mean-field phase diagram in
terms of the chemical potential difference between the two reservoirs, a
fictitious magnetic field to tune the spin imbalance of the system, and the
environmental temperature of the reservoirs, to clarify the relation between
the NFFLO state and the ordinary thermal-equilibrium FFLO state discussed in
spin-imbalanced Fermi gases.

We describe boson sampling of interacting atoms from the noncondensed
fraction of Bose-Einstein-condensed (BEC) gas confined in a box trap as a new
platform for studying computational sharpP-hardness of quantum many-body
systems. In this case the theory becomes really simple and transparent. We
calculate analytically the characteristic function and statistics of the
excited-state atom occupations in the Bogoliubov approximation by means of the
newly found hafnian master theorem and show their analogy to those of the
Gaussian boson sampling of noninteracting photons in a linear interferometer.
Importantly, due to interatomic interactions, the squeezing and interference of
atom excited states, both of which are necessary for the computational
sharpP-hardness of boson sampling, are self-generated in the gas and do not
require neither sophisticated external sources of bosons in squeezed states nor
controlled couplers, beam splitters and phase shifters needed for boson
sampling in optical interferometers. On this basis, we discuss how to get
manifestations of quantum supremacy of boson sampling over classical computing
in the experiments with BEC gas.

<br>
<br>
The switching dynamics of ferroelectric materials is a crucial intrinsic
property which directly affects the operation and performance of ferroelectric
devices. In conventional ferroelectric materials, the typical ferroelectric
switching mechanism is governed by a universal process of domain wall motion.
However, recent experiments indicate that Van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6
possesses anomalous polarization switching dynamics under an electric field. It
is important to understand the switching dynamics, but it remains theoretically
unexplored in CuInP2S6 due to the lack of description of its order-disorder
phase transition characteristics by density functional theory. Here, we employ
a machine-learning potential trained from the first principles density
functional theory dataset to conduct the large-scale atomistic simulations of
temperature-driven order-disorder ferroelectric phase transition in CuInP2S6.
Most importantly, it is found that the electric field-driven polarization
switching in CuInP2S6 is mediated by single Cu dipole flip, rather than
conventional domain wall motion mechanism. This intrinsic unconventional
switching behavior can be attributed to the competition between the energy
barrier of domain wall motion and single dipole flip.

<h3>Large magneto-thermal-switching ratio in superconducting Pb wires</h3>

<br>
<br>
Thermal switching by magnetic fields is one of the important functionalities
in thermal management technologies. In low-temperature devices, superconducting
states can be used as a magneto-thermal-switching (MTS) component, because
carrier thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) is strongly suppressed in
superconducting states. Recently, we demonstrated that the MTS ratio (MTSR) of
pure Nb reached 650% at a temperature (T) of 2.5 K under a magnetic field (H)
of 4.0 kOe [M. Yoshida et al., Appl. Phys. Express 16, 033002 (2023)]. In this
study, to enrich knowledge on MTS of superconductors, the MTSRs of pure Pb
wires with 5N and 3N purities were investigated by measuring the temperature or
magnetic field dependences of \k{appa}. For 5N-Pb, a large MTSR exceeding 1000%
was observed below 3.6 K under H > 600 Oe. Although higher MTSRs were expected
at lower temperatures under H > 600 Oe, the obtained data under those
conditions were accompanied by large errors due to magnetic-field-induced huge
\k{appa} at low temperatures. In contrast, the \k{appa} for 3N-Pb were observed
to be clearly lower than that for 5N-Pb. Although the magnetic-field-induced
change in \k{appa} was small, the MTSR at T = 2.5 K was 300%. These results
suggest that Pb is a promising material for low-temperature magneto-thermal
switching because of wide-range \k{appa} tunable by magnetic field and the
purity.

<h3>Magnetic bubble crystal in tetragonal magnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
A magnetic bubble crystal is a two-dimensional soliton lattice consisting of
multiple spin density waves similar to a magnetic skyrmion crystal.
Nevertheless, the emergence of the bubble crystal with a collinear spin texture
is rare compared to that of the skyrmion crystal with a noncoplanar spin
texture. Here we theoretically report the stabilization mechanisms of the
bubble crystal in tetragonal magnets. By performing numerical calculations
based on an efficient steepest descent method for an effective spin model with
magnetic anisotropy and multiple spin interactions in momentum space on a
two-dimensional square lattice, we construct magnetic field-temperature phase
diagrams for various sets of model parameters. We find that the bubble crystal
is stabilized at finite temperatures near the skyrmion crystal by an easy-axis
anisotropic two-spin interaction. Through a detailed analysis, we also show
that the high-harmonic wave-vector interaction and the biquadratic interaction
play important roles in the stability of the bubble crystal. Our results
indicate a close relationship between the bubble crystal and the skyrmion
crystal in terms of the stabilization mechanisms, which suggests the
possibility of the bubble crystal in the skyrmion-hosting materials by
controlling the easy-axis magnetic anisotropy through external and/or chemical
pressure.

<h3>Non-thermal Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid eventually emerging from hot  electrons in the quantum Hall regime</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dynamics of integrable systems, such as Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquids, is
deterministic, and the absence of stochastic thermalization processes provides
unique characteristics, such as long-lived non-thermal metastable states with
many conserved quantities. Here, we show such non-thermal states can emerge
even when the TL liquid is excited with extremely high-energy hot electrons in
chiral quantum-Hall edge channels. This demonstrates the robustness of the
integrable model against the excitation energy. Crossover from the
single-particle hot electrons to the many-body TL liquid is investigated by
using on-chip detectors with a quantum point contact and a quantum dot. The
charge dynamics can be understood with a single-particle picture only for hot
electrons. The resulting electron-hole plasma in the TL liquid shows a
non-thermal metastable state, in which warm and cold electrons coexist without
further thermalization. The multi-temperature constituents are attractive for
transporting information with conserved quantities along the channels.

<h3>Field-driven spatiotemporal manipulation of Majorana zero modes in  Kitaev spin liquid</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Kitaev quantum spin liquid possesses two fractional quasiparticles,
itinerant Majorana fermions and localized visons. It provides a promising
platform for realizing a Majorana zero mode trapped by a vison excitation. This
local mode behaves as a non-Abelian anyon capable of applications to quantum
computation. However, creating, observing, and manipulating visons remain
challenging even in the pristine Kitaev model. Here, we propose a theory to
control visons enabled by a time-dependent local magnetic field in the Kitaev
spin liquid. Examining the time evolution of the magnetic state, we demonstrate
that a vison follows a locally applied field sweeping in the system. We clarify
that one can move a vison accompanied by a Majorana zero mode by choosing the
velocity and shape of the local field appropriately. In particular, the
controllability of visons using local fields shows nonlinear behavior for its
strength, which originates from interactions between Majorana fermions and
visons. The present results suggest that itinerant Majorana fermions other than
zero modes play a crucial role in vison transport. Our finding will offer a
guideline for controlling Majorana zero modes in the Kitaev quantum spin
liquid.

The reliability of analysis is becoming increasingly important as
point-of-care diagnostics are transitioning from single analyte detection
towards multiplexed multianalyte detection. Multianalyte detection benefits
greatly from complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated sensing
solutions, offering miniaturized multiplexed sensing arrays with integrated
readout electronics and extremely large sensor counts. The development of CMOS
back end of line integration compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET)
based biosensing has been rapid during the last few years, both in terms of the
fabrication scale-up and functionalization towards biorecognition from real
sample matrices. The next steps in industrialization relate to improving
reliability and require increased statistics. Regarding functionalization
towards truly quantitative sensors and on-chip bioassays with improved
statistics require sensor arrays with reduced variability in functionalization.
Such multiplexed bioassays, whether based on graphene or on other sensitive
nanomaterials, are among the most promising technologies for label-free
electrical biosensing. As an important step towards that, we report wafer-scale
fabrication of CMOS integrated GFET arrays with high yield and uniformity,
designed especially for biosensing applications. We demonstrate the operation
of the sensing platform array with 512 GFETs in simultaneous detection for
sodium chloride concentration series. This platform offers a truly statistical
approach on GFET based biosensing and further to quantitative and multi-analyte
sensing. The reported techniques can also be applied to other fields relying on
functionalized GFETs, such as gas or chemical sensing or infrared imaging.

<h3>On recrystallization nucleation in pure aluminum</h3>

Static recrystallization is an important aspect of metal processing. The
initial stage of recrystallization - nucleation of new grains - determines its
later stages. The accepted mechanisms of recrystallization nucleation are based
on the assumption that embryos with orientations of the nuclei preexist in the
deformed matrix. However, this standard picture seems to be incomplete. There
are indications that, in some cases, the deformed matrix has no orientations
observed in recrystallized material. Therefore a mechanism of early stage
recrystallization without preexisting embryos is considered. Since the
recrystallization growth shows strong orientation selection, and the
recrystallization front is believed to migrate through collective shuffling of
atoms, it is postulated that the shuffling mechanism responsible for oriented
growth of a recrystallizing grain extends to the very beginning of the grain's
existence, i.e., that a new orientation can be created via rearrangement of
atoms in a strained region. The postulate explains the formation of new
orientations, and it has the potential to significantly change the
understanding of the early phase of recrystallization.

<br>
Wigner crystals are predicted as the crystallization of the dilute electron
gas moving in a uniform background when the electron-electron Coulomb energy
dominates the kinetic energy. The Wigner crystal has previously been observed
in the ultraclean two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) present on the surface of
liquid helium and in semiconductor quantum wells at high magnetic field. More
recently, Wigner crystals have also been reported in WS2/WSe2 moir\'e
heterostructures. ABC-stacked trilayer graphene on boron nitride (ABC-TLG/hBN)
moir\'e superlattices provide a unique tunable platform to explore Wigner
crystal states where the electron correlation can be controlled by electric and
magnetic field. Here we report the observation of magnetic field stabilized
Wigner crystal states in a ABC-TLG/hBN moir\'e superlattice. We show that
correlated insulating states emerge at multiple fractional and integer fillings
corresponding to v = 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 5/3 and 2 electrons per moir\'e lattice
site under a magnetic field. These correlated insulating states can be
attributed to generalized Mott states for the integer fillings (v = 1, 2) and
generalized Wigner crystal states for the fractional fillings (v = 1/3, 2/3,
4/3, 5/3). The generalized Wigner crystal states are stabilized by a vertical
magnetic field, and they are strongest at one magnetic flux quantum per three
moir\'e superlattices. The correlated insulating states at v = 2 persists up to
30 Tesla, which can be described by a Mott-Hofstadter transition at high
magnetic field. The tunable Mott and Wigner crystal states in the ABC-TLG/hBN
highlight the opportunities to discover new correlated quantum phases due to
the interplay between the magnetic field and moir\'e flatbands.

<br>
Searching for a universal trend by the same tuning method in different
high-temperature superconductors with a similar crystal structure is a common
strategy to find clues for a better understanding of the superconducting
mechanism in a unified way. It is known that the hole-doped bismuth-oxide
Ba1-xKxBiO3 possesses a similar perovskite structure to that of the hole-doped
copper-oxide (cuprate) superconductors but also holds a comparatively high
superconducting transition temperature. In this study, we report the first
observation of the pressure-induced quantum phase transition (QPT) from
superconducting to insulating states in a series of Ba1-xKxBiO3 single-crystal
samples. A similar QPT has also been observed recently in the compressed
cuprate superconductors1. Significantly, we found that the QPT observed in
Ba1-xKxBiO3 is intriguingly associated with the valence change of the Bi ions
in the material. These results lead us to propose that the pressure-induced
valence change from Bi3+ to Bi5+ destroys the hole-doping effect on stabilizing
the conductivity and corresponding superconductivity. By comparing the
high-pressure behaviors observed in these two kinds of oxides, we identified
another prominent feature shared by them - the more the hole-doping
concentration, the higher the critical pressure required for driving the QPT.

Among several models for microswimmers, the three-sphere microswimmer
proposed by Najafi and Golestanian captures the essential mechanism for the
locomotion of a swimmer in a viscous fluid. Owing to its simplicity and
flexibility, the original three-sphere model has been extended and generalized
in various ways to discuss new swimming mechanisms of microswimmers. We shall
provide a systematic and concise review of the various extensions of the
three-sphere microswimmers that have been developed by the present authors. In
particular, we shall discuss the following seven cases: elastic, thermal, odd,
autonomous three-sphere microswimmers; two interacting ones; and those in
viscoelastic and structured fluids. The well-known Purcell's scallop theorem
can be generalized for stochastic three-sphere microswimmers and also for the
locomotion in viscoelastic and structured fluids.

<br>
<br>
We experimentally investigated the dynamics of a sphere rolling up a granular
slope. During the rolling-up motion, the sphere experienced the slipping and
penetration (groove formation) on the surface of granular layer. The former
relates to the stuck motion of the rolling sphere, and the latter causes the
energy dissipation due to the deformation of granular surface. To characterize
these phenomena, we measured the motion of a sphere rolling up a granular slope
of angle $\alpha$. The initial velocity $v_0$, corresponding initial angular
velocity $\omega_0$, angle of slope $\alpha$, and density of the sphere
$\rho_s$ were varied. As a result, the penetration depth can be scaled solely
by density ratio between the sphere and granular layer. By considering equation
of motion, we estimated the friction due to the slips. Besides, by considering
energy conservation, we defined and estimated the friction due to groove
formation. The energy conservation is also useful to evaluate the maximum
travel distance of the sphere.

It is well known that periodic potentials can be used to induce freezing and
melting in colloids. Here, we transfer this concept to active systems and find
the emergence of a so-far unknown active matter phase in between the frozen
solid-like phase and the molten phase. This phase of "active adaptolates"
adopts the geometry of the underlying lattice like the frozen phase, maintains
ballistic dynamics like the molten phase, and percolates. In particular, this
finding creates a route to use external fields for designing the intrinsic
structure of active systems without qualitatively affecting their dynamics.

Dynamical mean-field theory is a powerful physics tool used to analyze the
typical behavior of neural networks, where neurons can be recurrently
connected, or multiple layers of neurons can be stacked. However, it is not
easy for beginners to access the essence of this tool and the underlying
physics. Here, we give a pedagogical introduction of this method in a
particular example of generic random neural networks, where neurons are
randomly and fully connected by correlated synapses and therefore the network
exhibits rich emergent collective dynamics. We also review related past and
recent important works applying this tool. In addition, a physically
transparent and alternative method, namely the dynamical cavity method, is also
introduced to derive exactly the same results. The numerical implementation of
solving the integro-differential mean-field equations is also detailed, with an
illustration of exploring the fluctuation dissipation theorem.

Topology-related ideas might lead to noise-resilient quantum computing. For
example, it is expected that the slow spatial exchange (`braiding') of Majorana
zero modes in superconductors yields quantum gates that are robust against
disorder. Here, we report our numerical experiments, which describe the
dynamics of a Majorana qubit built from quantum dots controlled by
time-dependent gate voltages. Our protocol incorporates non-protected control,
braiding-based protected control, and readout, of the Majorana qubit. We use
the Kitaev chain model for the simulations, and focus on the case when the main
source of errors is quasistatic charge noise affecting the hybridization energy
splitting of the Majorana modes. We provide quantitative guidelines to suppress
both diabatic errors and disorder-induced qubit dephasing, such that a fidelity
plateau is observed as the hallmark of the topological quantum gate. Our
simulations predict realistic features that are expected to be seen in future
braiding experiments with Majorana zero modes and other topological qubit
architectures.

Boltzmann generators (BGs) are now recognized as forefront generative models
for sampling equilibrium states of many-body systems in the canonical ensemble,
as well as for calculating the corresponding Helmholtz free energy.
Furthermore, BGs can potentially provide a notable improvement in efficiency
compared to conventional techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte
Carlo (MC) methods. By sampling from a clustered latent space, BGs can
circumvent free-energy barriers and overcome the rare-event problem. However,
one major limitation of BGs is their inability to sample across phase
transitions between ordered phases. This is due to the fact that new phases may
not be commensurate with the box dimensions, which remain fixed in the
canonical ensemble. In this work, we present a novel BG model for the
isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, which can successfully overcome this
limitation. This unsupervised machine-learning model can sample equilibrium
states at various pressures, as well as pressure-driven phase transitions. We
demonstrate that the samples generated by this model are in good agreement with
those obtained through MD simulations of two model systems. Additionally, we
derive an estimate of the Gibbs free energy using samples generated by the NPT
BG.

In a multiband Hubbard model the self-consistency relations for the two-body
bound-state bands are in the form of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Assuming
that the resultant eigenvectors form an orthonormal set, e.g., in the
strong-binding regime, here we reformulate their Berry curvatures and the
associated Chern numbers. As an illustration we solve the two-body problem in a
Haldane-Hubbard model with attractive onsite interactions, and analyze its
topological phase diagrams from weak to strong couplings, i.e., by keeping
track of the gap closings in between the low-lying two-body bands. The
resultant Chern numbers are consistent with the lobe structure of the phase
diagrams in the strong-coupling regime.

Motivated by experimental suggestions of anionic redox processes helping to
design higher energy lithium ion-battery cathode materials, we investigate this
effect using first-principles electronic structure calculations for Li-rich
layered sulfides. We identify the determination of the energetic contribution
of intra-atomic Hund's exchange coupling as a major obstacle to a reliable
theoretical description. We overcome this challenge by developing a
particularly efficient flavor of charge-self-consistent combined density
functional + dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Our scheme
allows us to describe the spin ground states of the transition metal d shell,
the electronic structure of the materials, and its energetics. As a result of
the high-spin to low-spin transition the average intercalation voltage shows
intriguing non-monotonic behavior. We rationalize these findings by an analysis
of the fluctuations of spin and charge degrees of freedom. Our work
demonstrates the relevance of most recent insights into correlated electron
materials for the physics of functional materials such as Li-ion battery
compounds.

Ultrasonic liquid phase exfoliation is a promising method for the production
of 2D layered materials. A large number of studies have been made in
investigating the underlying ultrasound exfoliation mechanisms. Due to the
experimental challenge in capturing in real-time the highly transient and
dynamic phenomena in sub-microsecond time scale and micrometer length scale at
the same time, most theories reported to date are still under intensive debate.
Here, we report the exciting new findings from the first scheduled user
experiment using the free electron laser MHz X-ray Microscopy at the SPB/SFX
instrument of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser. The ultra-short X-ray
pulse (~25 fs) and the unique pulse train time structure allow us to reveal
fully the ultrasound cavitation dynamics, including the nucleation, growth,
implosion dynamics of cavitation bubbles at different wave amplitudes. Using
ma-chine-learning image processing, the instance of bubble cloud shock wave
emission, their periodic impact onto the graphite materials and the cyclic
fatigue exfoliation mechanism in multi-time scale from sub-microsecond to tens

We have used an extended Scaled-Particle Theory that incorporates four-body
correlations through the fourth-order virial coefficient to analyse the
orientational properties of a fluid of hard right-angle triangles. This fluid
has been analysed by computer simulation studies, with clear indications of
strong octatic correlations present in the liquid-crystal phase, although the
more symmetric order tetratic phase would seem to be the most plausible
candidate. Standard theories based on the second virial coefficient are unable
to reproduce this behaviour. Our extended theory predicts that octatic
correlations, associated to a symmetry under global rotations of the oriented
fluid by $45^{\circ}$, are highly enhanced, but not enough to give rise to a
thermodynamically stable phase with strict octatic symmetry. We discuss
different scenarios to improve the theoretical understanding of the elusive
octatic phase in this intriguing fluid.

The bulk-edge correspondence is one of the most important ingredients in the
theory of topological phase of matter. While the bulk-edge correspondence is
applicable for Hermitian junction systems where two subsystems with independent
topological invariants are connected to each other, it has not been discussed
for junction systems with non-Hermitian point-gap topological phases. In this
Letter, based on analytical results obtained by the extension of non-Bloch band
theory to junction systems, we establish the bulk-edge correspondence for
point-gap topological phases in junction systems. Considering the eigenstates,
further, we find that the non-Hermitian junction systems exhibit unique
proximity effects.

We study the $p$-wave elastic collision rates in a two-dimensional
spin-polarized ultracold Fermi gas in the presence of a $p$-wave Feshbach
resonance. We derive the analytical relation of the elastic collision rate
coefficient in the close vicinity of resonance when the effective range is
dominant. The elastic collision rate is enhanced by an exponential scaling of
$e^{-q_{r}^{2} / q_{T}^{2}}$ towards the resonance.
Here, $q_{r}$ is the resonant momentum and $q_T$ is the thermal momentum. An
analogous expression is derived for the case of three dimensions successfully
explains the thermalization rates measurement in the recent experiment~[Phys.
Rev. A 88, 012710 (2013)]. In the zero-range limit where the effective range is
negligible, the elastic collision rate coefficient is proportional to
temperature $T^2$ and scattering area $A_{p}^2$. In this limit, energy transfer
from high to low velocity through $p$-wave collision is approximately
$\sqrt{2}$ times faster compared to the three-dimensional case. We also discuss
the collisional stability in the presence of three-body losses in the
background scattering limit. Our results suggest that $p$-wave evaporation may
be performed with improved efficiency and may provide insight into the dynamics
of the system in experiments.

<h3>In-plane thermal diffusivity determination using beam-offset  frequency-domain thermoreflectance with a one-dimensional optical heat source</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08564</a>
<br>
<i>Kai Xu, Jiali Guo, Grazia Raciti, Alejandro R. Goni, M. Isabel Alonso, Xavier Borrise, Ilaria Zardo, Mariano Campoy-Quiles, Juan Sebastian Reparaz</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an innovative contactless method suitable to study in-plane
thermal transport based on beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance using
a one-dimensional heat source with uniform power distribution. Using a
one-dimensional heat source provides a number of advantages as compared to
point-like heat sources, as typically used in time- and frequency-domain
thermoreflectance experiments, just to name a few: (i) it leads to a slower
spatial decay of the temperature field in the direction perpendicular to the
line-shaped heat source, allowing to probe the temperature field at larger
distances from the heater, hence, enhancing the sensitivity to in-plane thermal
transport; (ii) the frequency range of interest is typically < 100 kHz. This
rather low frequency range is convenient regarding the cost of the required
excitation laser system but, most importantly, it allows the study of materials
without the presence of a metallic transducer with almost no influence of the
finite optical penetration depth of the pump and probe beams on the thermal
phase lag, which arises from the large thermal penetration depth imposed by the
used frequency range. We also show that for the case of a harmonic thermal
excitation source, the phase lag between the thermal excitation and thermal
response of the sample exhibits a linear dependence with their spatial offset,
where the slope is proportional to the inverse of the thermal diffusivity of
the material. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to the cases of:
(i) suspended thin films of Si and PDPP4T, (ii) Bi bulk samples, and (iii) Si,
glass, and highly-oriented pyrollitic graphite (HOPG) bulk samples with a thin
metallic transducer. Finally, we also show that it is possible to study
in-plane heat transport on substrates with rather low thermal diffusivity,
e.g., glass, even using a metallic transducer.

<br>
<br>
We show that the tunable gate voltage in n-doped AlGaAs/GaAs QW (quantum
well) is a key in designing an efficient and ultrafast MRAM (magnetoresistive
random access memory). The Rashba spin-orbit coupling in such QWs can be tuned
appropriately by the gate voltage to create an intense spin-Hall field which in
turns interacts with the ferromagnetic layer of the MRAM through the mechanism
of spin orbit torque. The strong spin-Hall field leads to an infinitesimally
small switching time of the MRAM. Our proposed MRAM is thus a better
alternative to the conventional ferromagnetic/spin-Hall effect bi-layers MRAM
for the reason that the switching time can be varied with ease, which is
unfeasible in the later. Concisely, not only that this work signals a
possibility to design an ultra-fast MRAM, but it also suggests a model to
fabricate a tunable switching time MRAM.

Motivated by the recent realization of an artificial quantum spin ice in an
array of superconducting qubits with tunable parameters [King {\it et al.},
Science 373, 576 (2021)], we scrutinize a quantum six vertex model on the
square lattice that distinguishes type-I and type-II vertices. We map the
zero-temperature phase diagram using numerical (exact diagonalization) and
analytical (perturbation expansion, Gerschgorin theorem) methods. Following a
symmetry classification, we identify three crystalline phases alongside a
subextensive manifold of isolated configurations. Monte Carlo simulations at
the multicritical Rokhsar-Kivelson point provide evidence for a quantum phase
exhibiting a cascade of transitions with increasing flux. By comparing
structure factors, we find evidence for the emergence of the fully flippable
and plaquette phases in the artificial quantum spin ice.

<br>
<br>
Superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a newly burgeoning field of
unconventional superconductors and raise intriguing questions about the
presence of superconductivity in highly disordered systems, which lack regular
phonon modes. In our study, we have synthesized and investigated the
superconducting characteristics of two new transition elements based HEAs
Re$_{0.35} $Os$_{0.35} $Mo$_{0.08} $W$_{0.10} $Zr$_{0.12}$ (ReOMWZ)
crystallizing in noncentrosymmetric $\alpha$-Mn structure, and Ru$_{0.35}
$Os$_{0.35} $Mo$_{0.10} $W$_{0.10} $Zr$_{0.10}$ (RuOMWZ) crystallizing
hexagonal closed-packed structure (hcp). Transition metal-based hexagonal hcp
HEA is rare and highly desirable for practical applications due to their high
hardness. Bulk magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat measurements
confirmed bulk type-II superconductivity in both alloys. Specific heat analysis
up to the measured low-temperature range suffices for a BCS explanation.
Comparable upper critical fields with the Pauli paramagnetic limit suggest the
possibility of unconventional superconductivity in both HEAs.

<h3>Topological Phase Transitions of Generalized Brillouin Zone</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
It has been known that the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) of the
non-Hermitian skin effect is characterized by the topology of the complex
eigenvalue spectra, while the topology of the wave function gives rise to
Hermitian BBC with conventional boundary modes. In this work, we go beyond the
known description of the non-Hermitian topological phase by discovering a new
type of BBC that appears in generalized boundary conditions. The generalized
Brillouin zone (GBZ) possesses non-trivial topological structures in the
intermediate boundary condition between open and periodic boundary conditions.
Unlike the conventional BBC, the topological phase transition is characterized
by the generalized momentum touching of GBZ, which manifests as exceptional
points. As a realization of our proposal, we suggest the non-reciprocal
Kuramoto oscillator lattice, where the phase slips accompany the exceptional
points as a signature of such topological phase transition. Our work
establishes an understanding of non-Hermitian topological matter by
complementing the non-Hermitian BBC as a general foundation of the
non-Hermitian topological systems.

<br>
<br>
We use the composite operator method (COM) to analyze the strongly correlated
repulsive Hubbard model, investigating the effect of nearest-neighbor hoppings
up to fourth order on a square lattice. We consider two sets of self-consistent
equations, one enforcing the Pauli principle and the other imposing
charge-charge, spin-spin, and pair-pair correlations using a decoupling scheme
developed by L. Roth. We extract three distinct solutions from these equations:
COM1 and COM2 by imposing the Pauli principle and one from Roth decoupling. An
overview of the method studying the validity of particle-hole symmetry and the
Luttinger theorem for each solution is presented. Additionally, we extend the
initial basis to study superconductivity, concluding that it is induced by the
Van Hove singularity. Finally, we include higher-order hoppings using realistic
estimates for tight binding parameters and compare our results with ARPES
measurements on cuprates.

The analytical expression for the optimal protocol of the thermodynamic work
and its variance for finite-time, isothermal and weak processes is presented.
The method that solves the Euler-Lagrange integral equation is quite general
and depends only on the properties of symmetry of the optimal protocol. The
solution is proven to be physically consistent and many examples are solved to
illustrate the method. To overcome the hypothesis consistency problem of the
singular part of the solution, an interpretation of the appearance of the delta
peaks and their derivatives is presented.

<h3>Quantum Monte Carlo study of Doppler broadening of positron annihilation  radiation in semiconductors and insulators</h3>

<br>
<br>
The measurement of the momentum distribution of positron annihilation
radiation is a powerful method to detect and identify open-volume defects in
crystalline solids. The Doppler broadening of the 511 keV line of the $2\gamma$
electron-positron annihilation event reflects the momentum density of
annihilating pairs and local electron momenta at positron annihilation sites.
It can provide information on the chemical surroundings of vacancies, such as
the impurity atoms around them. Accurate methods based on first-principles
calculations are crucial for interpreting measured Doppler spectra. In this
work we will validate such a method based on variational quantum Monte Carlo by
benchmarking results in aluminium nitride and silicon against experimental data
measured from defect-free reference samples. The method directly models
electron-positron correlations using variational wave functions. We achieve
better agreement with experiments for our test set than conventional
state-of-the-art methods. We show that normalized Doppler broadening spectra
calculated with quantum Monte Carlo converge rapidly as a function of
simulation cell size, and backflow transformations have only a minor effect.
This makes the method robust and practical to support positron-based
spectroscopies.

We investigated the Cu/Ni-O$_2$ bilayer multi-orbital Hubbard model with
Cu/Ni impurity approximation embedded in the O lattice by incorporating the
3d$^{8}$ multiplet structure coupled to a full O-2p band. For this simplified
model of describing the local electronic structure of hole doped homo-bilayer
Cu(Ni)O$_2$-Cu(Ni)O$_2$ and hetero-bilayer CuO$_2$-NiO$_2$, we demonstrate that
the homo-bilayer system hosts rich phase diagram with inversion symmetry
breaking between two layers at strong enough interlayer hybridization,
especially the coexistence of two-hole singlet and triplet states in opposite
layers. Besides, we show that the interlayer hybridization in hetero-bilayer
systems destabilizes the Zhang-Rice singlets or 3d$^{8}$ triplets within each
layer via charge transfer between layers. The relevance of these electronic
redistribution to the bilayer or interface systems of cuprates and/or
nickelates are discussed.

<br>
Electronic transport and magnetic properties of bulk and rapid melt quenched
samples of the Mn$_3$Al Heusler alloy were studied. A correlation between the
magnetic and structural states was established. For a cast sample, there is no
ferromagnetic moment, and the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility (break at
low temperatures and the Curie-Weiss law with high values of the paramagnetic
Curie temperature) indicates a frustrated antiferromagnetic state. At the same
time, for a rapid melt quenched sample, a ferrimagnetic state is observed with
a moment close to compensation. The results of measurements of the electrical
resistivity and the Hall effect evidence as well in favor of the implementation
of these magnetic states.

This study focuses on the self-assembly and subsequent diamond growth on
SiO$_2$ buffered lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$) and lithium tantalate (LiTaO$_3$)
single crystals. The zeta-potential of LNO and LTO single crystal were measured
as a function of pH. They were found to be negative in the pH range 3.5-9.5.
The isoelectric point for LNO was found to be at pH $\sim$ 2.91 and that of LTO
to be at pH $\sim$ 3.20. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed on the
surfaces show presence of oxygen groups which may be responsible for the
negative zeta potential of the crystals. Self-assembly of nanodiamond particles
on LTO and LNO, using nanodiamond colloid, were studied. As expected, high
nanodiamond density was seen when self-assembly was done using a positively
charged nanodiamond particles. Diamond growth was attempted on the nanodiamond
coated substrates but they were found to be unsuitable for direct growth due to
disintegration of substrates in diamond growth conditions.. A $\sim$100nm thick
silicon dioxide layer was deposited on the crystals, followed by nanodiamond
self assembly and diamond growth. Thin diamond films were successfully grown on
both coated crystals. The diamond quality was analysed by Raman spectroscopy
and atomic force microscopy.

The nonequilibrium behavior of Co/Cu/Co and Pt/Co/Cu/Co/Pt multilayer
structures was studied by the Monte Carlo method for various types of magnetic
anisotropy. An analysis of the results of calculations of the two-time
autocorrelation function was carried out, and the evolution of structures from
various initial states was considered. An analysis of the results shows aging
with a slowdown in the correlation characteristics with an increase in the
waiting time. The dependence of the aging characteristics of the studied
structures on the film thickness is considered. There is a difference in
behavior from bulk systems, aging in multilayer structures occurs in a wide
temperature range at $T \leq T_c$ and not only at the ordering temperature
$T_c$. Investigation of transport properties makes it possible to reveal
nontrivial aging in the two-time dependence of magnetoresistance, as well as
the influence of anisotropy and initial states on its values.

Millimeter-sized Ce$_2$Rh$_{3+\delta}$Sb$_4$ ($\delta\approx 1/8$) single
crystals were synthesized by a Bi-flux method and its physical properties were
studied by a combination of electrical transport, magnetic and thermodynamic
measurements. The resistivity anisotropy $\rho_{a,b}/\rho_{c}\sim2$,
manifesting a quasi-one-dimensional electronic character. Magnetic
susceptibility measurements confirm $\mathbf{ab}$ as the magnetic easy plane. A
long-range antiferromagnetic transition occurs at $T_N=1.4$ K, while clear
short-range ordering can be detected well above $T_N$. The low ordering
temperature is ascribed to the large Ce-Ce distance as well as the geometric
frustration. Kondo scale is estimated to be about 2.4 K, comparable to the
strength of magnetic exchange. Ce$_2$Rh$_{3+\delta}$Sb$_4$, therefore,
represents a rare example of dense Kondo lattice whose
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange and Kondo coupling are both weak but

<h3>Escape of a Sticky Particle</h3>

<br>
Adsorption to a surface, reversible-binding, and trapping are all prevalent
scenarios where particles exhibit "stickiness". Escape and first-passage times
are known to be drastically affected, but detailed understanding of this
phenomenon remains illusive. To tackle this problem, we develop an analytical
approach to the escape of a diffusing particle from a domain of arbitrary
shape, size, and surface reactivity. This is used to elucidate the effect of
stickiness on the escape time from a slab domain: revealing how adsorption and
desorption rates affect the mean and variance, thus providing a novel approach
to infer these rates from measurements. Moreover, as any smooth boundary is
locally flat, slab results are leveraged to devise a numerically efficient
scheme for simulating the sticky escape problem in arbitrary domains. This
letter thus offers a new starting point for analytical and numerical studies of
stickiness and its role in escape, first-passage, and diffusion-controlled
reactions.

<br>
<i>Victoria A. Vasileva, Daria A. Mazur, Yury A. Budkov</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we present a continuation of our research on modeling
electrolyte solutions within charged slit pores. We make use of the model
developed by Blossey et al., which takes into account the structural
interactions between ions through a bilinear form over the gradients of local
ionic concentrations in the grand thermodynamic potential, as well as their
steric interactions through the lattice gas model. The structural interactions
may describe effects of the molecular structure of ions at a phenomenological
level. For example, these effects include steric effects due to non-spherical
shapes of ions, their conformation lability, and solvent effects. In addition,
we explore their specific interactions with the pore walls by incorporating
external attractive potentials. Our primary focus is on observing the behavior
of ionic concentration profiles and the disjoining pressure as the pore width
changes. By starting with the local mechanical equilibrium condition, we derive
a general expression for the disjoining pressure. Our findings indicate that
considering the structural interactions of ions leads to a pronounced minimum
on the disjoining pressure profiles at small pore widths. We attribute this
minimum to the formation of electric double layers on the electrified surfaces
of the pore. Additionally, our results demonstrate that inclusion of the
attractive interactions of ions with the pore walls enhances this minimum and
shifts it to smaller pore thicknesses. Our theoretical discoveries may be
useful for those involved in supercapacitor electrochemical engineering,
particularly when working with porous electrodes that have been infused with
concentrated electrolyte solutions.

We numerically investigate and develop analytic models for both the DC and
pulsed spin-orbit-torque (SOT)-driven response of order parameter in
single-domain Mn$_3$Sn, which is a metallic antiferromagnet with an anti-chiral
120$^\circ$ spin structure. We show that DC currents above a critical threshold
can excite oscillatory dynamics of the order parameter in the gigahertz to
terahertz frequency spectrum. Detailed models of the oscillation frequency
versus input current are developed and found to be in excellent agreement with
the numerical simulations of the dynamics. In the case of pulsed excitation,
the magnetization can be switched from one stable state to any of the other
five stable states in the Kagome plane by tuning the duration or the amplitude
of the current pulse. Precise functional forms of the final switched state
versus the input current are derived, offering crucial insights into the
switching dynamics of Mn$_3$Sn. The readout of the magnetic state can be
carried out via either the anomalous Hall effect, or the recently demonstrated
tunneling magnetoresistance in an all-Mn$_3$Sn junction. We also discuss
possible disturbance of the magnetic order due to heating that may occur if the
sample is subject to large currents. Operating the device in pulsed mode or
using low DC currents reduces the peak temperature rise in the sample due to
Joule heating. Our predictive modeling and simulation results can be used by
both theorists and experimentalists to explore the interplay of SOT and the
order dynamics in Mn$_3$Sn, and to further benchmark the device performance.

We present a first-principles study of the effect of 3$d$ transition metal
intercalation on the magnetic properties of the 2H-NbS$_2$ system, using
spin-resolved density functional theory calculations to investigate the
electronic structure of $N_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ ($N$ = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni).
We are able to accurately determine the magnetic moments and crystal field
splitting, and find that the magnetic properties of the materials are
determined by a mechanism based on filling rigid bands with electrons from the
intercalant.
We predict the dominant magnetic interaction of these materials by
considering Fermi surface nesting, finding agreement with experiment where data
are available.

Magnonics, an emerging field of Magnetism, studies spin waves (SWs) in
nano-structures, with an aim towards possible applications. As information may
be eventually transmitted with efficiency stored in the phase and amplitude of
spin waves, a topic of interest within Magnonics is the propagation of SW
modes. Thus, understanding mechanisms that may influence SW propagation is of
interest. Here the effect of localized surface geometric defects on
magnetostatic surface modes propagation is studied in ferromagnetic films and
semi-infinite media. Theoretical results are developed that allow to calculate
the scattering of these surface or Damon-Eshbach (DE) modes. A Green-Extinction
theorem is used to determine the scattering of incident surface modes, through
the determination of phase shifts of associated modes that are symmetric and
anti-symmetric under inversion in the same geometry with geometric defects.
Choosing localized symmetric depressions as geometric defects, scattering
transmission coefficients are determined that show perfect transmission at
specific frequencies or wave-lengths, that we associate with resonances in the
system. Interestingly the system shows the appearance of localized modes in the
depression regions, with associated discrete frequencies immersed in the
continuum spectrum of these surface DE modes. These localized modes have a
short wave-length content, and appear similarly in semi-infinite surfaces with
depressions. The latter indicates that these types of scattering effects should
appear in all surfaces with roughness or more pronounced geometric defects.

The crystal structure of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite has been investigated under
high-pressure by synchrotron-based powder X-ray diffraction. We found that
after the previously reported phase transitions in CH3NH3PbBr3
(Pm-3m->Im-3->Pmn21), which occur below 2 GPa, there is a third transition to a
crystalline phase at 4.6 GPa. This transition is reported here for the first
time contradicting previous studies which reported amorphization of CH3NH3PbBr3
between 2.3 and 4.6 GPa. Our X-ray diffraction measurements show that
CH3NH3PbBr3 remains crystalline up to 7.6 GPa, the highest pressure covered by
experiments. The new high-pressure phase is also described by the space group
Pmn21, but the transition involves abrupt changes in the unit-cell parameters
and a 3% decrease of the unit-cell volume. Our conclusions are confirmed by
optical-absorption experiments and visual observations and by the fact that
changes induced by pressure up to 10 GPa are reversible. The optical studies
also allow for the determination of the pressure dependence of the band-gap
energy which is discussed using the structural information obtained from X-ray
diffraction.

Scattering through natural porous formations (by far the most ubiquitous

flow and transport properties. In particular, we are interested here in the
scattering of a passive scalar as determined by a steady velocity field which
is generated by a line of singularity. The velocity undergoes to erratic
spatial variations, and concurrently the evolution of the scattering is
conveniently described within a stochastic framework that regards the
conductivity of the hosting medium as a stationary, Gaussian, random field.
Unlike the similar one for uniform (in the mean) flow-fields, the problem at
stake results much more complex. Central for the present study is the
fluctuation of the driving field, that is computed in closed (analytical) form
as large time limit of the same quantity in the unsteady state flow regime. The
structure of the second-order moment X_{rr}, quantifying the scattering along
the radial direction, is explained by the rapid change of the distance along
which the velocities of two fluid particles become uncorrelated. Moreover, two
approximate, analytical expressions are shown to be quite accurate into
reproducing the full simulations of X_{rr}. Finally, the same problem is
encountered in other fields, belonging both to the classical and to the quantum
physics. As such, our results lend themselves to be used within a context much
wider than that exploited in the present study.

We present a theoretical and computational model for the behavior of a porous
solid undergoing two interdependent processes, the finite deformation of a
solid and species migration through the solid, which are distinct in bulk and
on surface. Nonlinear theories allow us to systematically study porous solids
in a wide range of applications, such as drug delivery, biomaterial design,
fundamental study of biomechanics and mechanobiology, and the design of sensors
and actuators. As we aim to understand the physical phenomena at a smaller
length scale towards comprehending the fundamental biological processes and the
miniaturization of devices, the surface effect becomes more pertinent. Although
existing methodologies provide the necessary tools to study coupled bulk
effects for deformation and diffusion; however, very little is known about
fully coupled bulk and surface poroelasticity at finite strain. Here we develop
a thermodynamically consistent formulation for multiphysics processes of
surface and bulk poroelasticity, specialized for soft hydrated solids, along
with a corresponding finite element implementation. Our multiphysical approach
captures the interplay between competing processes of finite deformation and
species diffusion through the bulk and surface, and provides invaluable insight
when surface effects are important.

The possibility of the appearance of a dielectric electron-hole liquid (EHL)
in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides and heterostructures based on
them is considered. It is shown that the coherent pairing of electrons and
holes in them leads to the formation of a dielectric EHL when the degree of
circular polarization of the exciting light exceeds a certain threshold value.
Below this value, a metallic EHL is realized. Some possible physical
manifestations of the transition between these two types of EHL are noted.

Magnetic materials with noncollinear spin textures are promising for
spintronic applications. To realize practical devices, control over the length
and energy scales of such spin textures is imperative. The chiral helimagnets
Cr1/3NbS2 and Cr1/3TaS2 exhibit analogous magnetic phase diagrams with
different real-space periodicities and field dependence, positioning them as
model systems for studying the relative strengths of the microscopic mechanisms
giving rise to exotic spin textures. Here, we carry out a comparative study of
the electronic structures of Cr1/3NbS2 and Cr1/3TaS2 using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. We show
that bands in Cr1/3TaS2 are more dispersive than their counterparts in
Cr1/3NbS2 and connect this result to bonding and orbital overlap in these
materials. We also unambiguously distinguish exchange splitting from surface
termination effects by studying the dependence of their photoemission spectra
on polarization, temperature, and beam size. We find strong evidence that
hybridization between intercalant and host lattice electronic states mediates
the magnetic exchange interactions in these materials, suggesting that band
engineering is a route toward tuning their spin textures. Overall, these
results underscore how the modular nature of intercalated transition metal
dichalcogenides translates variation in composition and electronic structure to
complex magnetism.

Ultra-cold Fermi gases display diverse quantum mechanical properties,
including the transition from a fermionic superfluid BCS state to a bosonic
superfluid BEC state, which can be probed experimentally with high precision.
However, the theoretical description of these properties is challenging due to
the onset of strong pairing correlations and the non-perturbative nature of the
interaction among the constituent particles. This work introduces a novel
Pfaffian-Jastrow neural-network quantum state that includes backflow
transformation based on message-passing architecture to efficiently encode
pairing, and other quantum mechanical correlations. Our approach offers
substantial improvements over comparable ans\"atze constructed within the
Slater-Jastrow framework and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo
methods, as indicated by our lower ground-state energies. We observe the
emergence of strong pairing correlations through the opposite-spin pair
distribution functions. Moreover, we demonstrate that transfer learning
stabilizes and accelerates the training of the neural-network wave function,
enabling the exploration of the BCS-BEC crossover region near unitarity. Our
findings suggest that neural-network quantum states provide a promising
strategy for studying ultra-cold Fermi gases.

<h3>Atomistic mechanisms underlying the maximum in diffusivity in doped  Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$</h3>

Doped lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO) is a promising class of solid
electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries due to their good electrochemical
stability and compatibility with Li metal anodes. Ionic diffusivity in these
ceramics is known to occur via correlated, vacancy mediated, jumps of Li+
between alternating tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Aliovalent doping at the
Zr-site increases the concentration of vacancies in the Li+ sublattice and
cation diffusivity, but such an increase is universally followed by a decrease
for Li+ concentration lower than 6.3 - 6.5 Li molar content. Molecular dynamics
simulations based on density functional theory show that the maximum in
diffusivity originates from competing effects between the increased vacancy
concentration and the increasing occupancy of the low-energy tetrahedral sites
by Li+, which increases the overall activation energy associated with
diffusion. For the relatively high temperatures of our simulations, Li+
concentration plays a dominant role in transport as compared to dopant
chemistry.
