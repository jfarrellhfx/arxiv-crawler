<h3>Adiabatic pumping and transport in the Sierpinski-Hofstadter model</h3>

Topological phases have been reported on self-similar structures in the
presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. Here, we present an understanding
of these phases from a perspective of spectral flow and charge pumping. We
study the Harper-Hofstadter model on self-similar structures constructed from
the Sierpinski gasket. We numerically investigate the spectral flow and the
associated charge pumping when a flux tube is inserted through the structure
and the flux through the tube is varied adiabatically. We find that the nature
of the spectral flow is qualitatively different from that of translationally
invariant non-interacting systems with a perpendicular magnetic field. We show
that the instantaneous eigenspectra can be used to understand the quantization
of the charge pumped over a cycle, and hence to understand the topological
character of the system. We show the correspondence between the local
contributions to the Hall conductivity and the spectral flow of the edge-like
states. We also show that the edge-like states can be approximated by
eigenstates of the discrete angular-momentum operator, their chiral nature
being a consequence of this.

<h3>Roles of packing fraction, microscopic friction and projectile spin in  cratering by impact</h3>

From small seeds falling from trees to asteroids colliding with planets and
moons, the impact of projectiles onto granular targets occurs in nature at
different scales. In this paper, we investigate open questions in the mechanics
of granular cratering, in particular the forces acting on the projectile, and
the roles of granular packing, grain-grain friction and projectile spin. For
that, we carried out DEM (discrete element method) computations of the impact
of solid projectiles on a cohesionless granular medium, where we varied the
projectile and grain properties (diameter, density, friction and packing
fraction) for different available energies (within relatively small values). We
found that a denser region forms below the projectile, pushing it back and
causing its rebound by the end of its motion, and that solid friction affects
considerably the crater morphology. Besides, we show that the penetration
length increases with the initial spin of the projectile, and that differences
in initial packing fractions can engender the diversity of scaling laws found
in the literature. Finally, we propose an ad hoc scaling that collapsed our
data for the penetration length and can perhaps unify existing correlations.
Our results provide new insights into the formation of craters in granular
matter.

<h3>Coarsening transitions of wet liquid foams under microgravity conditions</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report foam coarsening studies which were performed in the International
Space Station (ISS) to suppress drainage due to gravity. Foams and bubbly
liquids with controlled liquid fractions $\phi$ between 15 and 50 % were
investigated to study the transition between bubble growth laws previously
reported near the dry limit $\phi \rightarrow 0$ and the dilute limit $\phi
\rightarrow 1$ (Ostwald ripening). We determined the coarsening rates, which
are in close agreement with theoretical predictions for the driest foams. When
the liquid fraction is increased beyond a critical value, we observe a sharp
cross-over between the respective laws. The critical value $\phi^*$ is
characteristic of a transition, above which the neighboring bubbles are no
longer all in contact like a jamming transition. Remarkably $\phi^*$ is
significantly larger than the random close packing volume fraction of the
bubbles $\phi_{\text{rcp}}$ which was determined independently. We attribute
the differences between $\phi^*$ and $\phi_{\text{rcp}}$ to a weakly adhesive
bubble interaction that we have studied in complementary ground-based
experiments.

<h3>Dissipative quantum many-body dynamics in (1+1)D quantum cellular  automata and quantum neural networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11209" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11209</a>

<br>
<br>
Classical artificial neural networks, built from perceptrons as their
elementary units, possess enormous expressive power. Here we investigate a
quantum neural network architecture, which follows a similar paradigm. It is
structurally equivalent to so-called (1+1)D quantum cellular automata, which
are two-dimensional quantum lattice systems on which dynamics takes place in
discrete time. Information transfer between consecutive time slices -- or
adjacent network layers -- is governed by local quantum gates, which can be
regarded as the quantum counterpart of the classical perceptrons. Along the
time-direction an effective dissipative evolution emerges on the level of the
reduced state, and the nature of this dynamics is dictated by the structure of
the elementary gates. We show how to construct the local unitary gates to yield
a desired many-body dynamics, which in certain parameter regimes is governed by
a Lindblad master equation. We study this for small system sizes through
numerical simulations and demonstrate how collective effects within the quantum
cellular automaton can be controlled parametrically. Our study constitutes a
step towards the utilisation of large-scale emergent phenomena in large quantum
neural networks for machine learning purposes.

<h3>Assessing the stability fields of molecular and polymeric CO2</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11224" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11224</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We investigated the stability of polymeric CO2 over a wide range of
pressures, temperatures, and chemical environments. We find that the I-42d
polymeric structure, consisting of a three-dimensional network of corner
sharing CO4 tetrahedra, forms at 40-140 GPa and from a CO-N2 mixture at 39 GPa.
An exceptional stability field of 0 to 286 GPa and 100 to 2500 K is documented
for this structure, making it a viable candidate for planetary interiors. The
stability of the tetrahedral polymeric motif of CO2-V is a consequence of the
rigidity of sp3 hybridized orbitals of carbon in a closed-packed oxygen
sublattice.

<h3>$μ^+$ Knight Shift in UTe$_2$: Evidence for Relocalization in a Kondo  Lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11242</a>

<br>
<br>
The local magnetic susceptibility of the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$
has been investigated by positive muon ($\mu^+$) Knight shift measurements in
the normal state. Three distinct $\mu^+$ Knight shift components are observed
for a magnetic field applied parallel to the $c$ axis. Two of these exhibit a
breakdown in the linear relationship with the bulk magnetic susceptibility
($\chi$) below a temperature $T^* \! \sim \! 30$ K, which points to a gradual
emergence of a correlated Kondo liquid. Below $T_{\rm r} \! \sim \! 12$ K
linearity is gradually restored, indicating partial relocalization of the Kondo
liquid quasiparticles. The third Knight shift component is two orders of
magnitude larger, and despite the $c$-axis alignment of the external field,
scales with the $a$-axis $\chi$ above $T_{\rm r} \! \sim \! 12$ K. We
conjecture that this component is associated with magnetic clusters and the
change in the temperature dependence of all three Knight shift components below
$T_{\rm r}$ is associated with a change in magnetic correlations. Our findings
indicate that prior to the onset of superconductivity the development of the
itinerant heavy-electron fluid is halted by a gradual development of local U
$5f$-moment fluctuations.

<h3>Star-Mesh Quantized Hall Array Resistance Devices</h3>

<br>
<br>
Advances in the development of graphene-based technology have enabled
improvements in DC resistance metrology. Devices made from epitaxially grown
graphene have replaced the GaAs-based counterparts, leading to an easier and
more accessible realization of the ohm. By optimizing the scale of the growth,
it has become possible to fabricate quantized Hall array resistance standards
(QHARS) with nominal values between 1 k{\Omega} and 1.29 M{\Omega}. One of
these QHARS device designs accommodates a value of about 1.01 M{\Omega}, which
made it an ideal candidate to pursue a proof-of-concept that graphene-based
QHARS devices are suitable for forming wye-delta resistance networks. In this
work, the 1.01 M{\Omega} array output nearly 20.6 M{\Omega} due to the
wye-delta transformation, which itself is a special case of star-mesh
transformations. These mathematical equivalence principles allow one to extend
the QHR to the 100 M{\Omega} and 10 G{\Omega} resistance levels with fewer
array elements than would be necessary for a single array with many more
elements in series. The 1.01 M{\Omega} device shows promise that the wye-delta
transformation can shorten the calibration chain, and, more importantly,
provide a chain with a more direct line to the quantum SI.

<h3>Coupled system of electrons and exciton-polaritons: Screening, dynamical  effects, and superconductivity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11245</a>

<br>
<br>
Bose-Fermi systems such as mixtures of electrons with excitons or
exciton-polaritons are extensively discussed as candidates to host a variety of
intriguing phenomena, including polaron formation, drag effects, supersolidity,
and superconductivity. In this work, assuming the strong-coupling regime
between the semiconductor excitons and cavity photons, we develop the many-body
theory approach addressing the interplay of different types of interaction
among various species in such a mixture, wherein we take into account dynamical
density responses of both the Bose-condensed exciton-polaritons and the
two-dimensional electron gas inside an optical microcavity. As was anticipated
previously, at high enough polariton densities the lower hybrid mode of the
system's excitation spectrum acquires a roton minimum, making the system prone
to superconducting pairing in the vicinity of the roton instability. We analyze
the possibility of polariton-BEC-mediated superconductivity in the electron gas
taking into account full momentum and frequency dependence of the gap, as well
as in the Eliashberg approach where the momentum dependence is neglected, and
in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach that discards the frequency
dependence and dynamical effects. Considering the interaction screening in
Thomas-Fermi and in random-phase approximations, we estimate the critical
temperatures of superconductivity to be not larger than 0.1 K in the vicinity
of instability. As possible realizations of the coupled polariton-electron
system, semiconductor quantum wells and two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides are considered.

<h3>Onset of strong coupling in site-controlled high C3v-symmetric InGaAs  QD-nanocavity on the (111)B-oriented GaAs membrane</h3>

<br>
<br>
Precise positioning of single site-controlled InGaAs QD embedded in the
(111)B-oriented GaAs PhC cavity, which enables high C3v symmetries of QD with
nanometer-scale accuracy offers great promise for on-chip photonic quantum
information processing. However, achieving the strong coupling regime in this
geometry is rarely reported due to the increase in cavity loss. Here, we reveal
the onset of phonon-mediated coherent exciton-photon interaction on our
tailored device. Our results present a Rabi-like oscillation of luminescence
intensity between excitonic and photonic components correlated with their
oscillatory energy splitting. Such Rabi-like oscillation is well reproduced by
modeling the coherent exchange of the exciton-photon population. The modeling
further reveals an oscillatory two-time covariance at QD-cavity resonance,
which indicates the system operates at the onset of the strong coupling regime.
Moreover, by using the cavity mode as a probe of the virtual state of QD
induced by phonon scattering, it reveals an increase in phonon scattering rates
near the QD-cavity resonance, which can result in the onset of the strong
coupling regime disguised with a singlet spectral feature.

<h3>Contour-time approach to the disordered Bose-Hubbard model in the strong  coupling regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11260</a>

<br>
<br>
There has been considerable interest in the disordered Bose Hubbard model
(BHM) in recent years, particularly in the context of thermalization and
many-body localization. We develop a two-particle irreducible (2PI)
strong-coupling approach to the disordered BHM that allows us to treat both
equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium situations. We obtain equations of motion
for spatio-temporal correlations and explore their equilibrium solutions. We
study the equilibrium phase diagram as a function of disorder strength and
discuss applications of the formalism to out-of-equilibrium situations. We also
note that the disorder strengths where the emergence of non-ergodic dynamics
was observed in a recent experiment [Choi $et \,al.$, Science $\bf{352}$, 1547
(2016)] appear to correspond to the Mott insulator -- Bose glass phase
boundary.

<h3>Gate-tunable phonon magnetic moment in bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11283</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao-Wei Zhang, Yafei Ren, Chong Wang, Ting Cao, Di Xiao</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a first-principles quantum scheme to calculate the phonon magnetic
moment in solids. As a showcase example, we apply our method to study gated
bilayer graphene, a material with strong covalent bonds. According to the
classical theory based on the Born effective charge, the phonon magnetic moment
in this system should vanish, yet our quantum mechanical calculations find
significant phonon magnetic moments. Furthermore, the magnetic moment is highly
tunable by changing the gate voltage. Our results firmly establish the
necessity of the quantum mechanical treatment, and identify small-gap covalent
materials as a promising platform for studying tunable phonon magnetic moment.

<h3>Universal phonon softening in the pseudogap state of  Tl$_2$Ba$_2$Ca$_{n-1}$Cu$_n$O$_{2n+4+δ}$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Exploring the origin of the pseudogap is important for the understanding of
superconductivity in cuprates. Here we report a systematical experimental study
on the phonon vibrational properties of
Tl$_2$Ba$_2$Ca$_{n-1}$Cu$_n$O$_{2n+4+\delta}$ ($n$=1,2,3) single crystals based
on the Raman scattering measurements over the temperature range from 10 to 300
K. The temperature evolution of the frequency and linewidth of the observed
phonon modes in each member of this family does not follow the expected
self-energy effect when entering the superconducting state. Instead, these
phonon modes exhibit a universal softening behavior below the temperature
around 150 K, which is higher above the superconducting transition. From the
comparison with the existing experimental data for various orders, we find that
the observed starting temperature for the phonon softening corresponds to the
onset opening temperature of the pseudogap. This finding indicates a large
lattice effect in the pseudogap state and the non-negligible spin-phonon
coupling for such a phonon softening.

<h3>Lattice effect on the superexchange interaction in antiferromagnetic  Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The in-plane superexchange interaction $J$ of cuprate superconductors has
long been suggested to be an important parameter for exploring their
high-temperature superconductivity. The bilayer
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ is the most studied system with high-quality
single crystals in the wide doping range with the the same structure and phase.
So far, the lattice parameter dependence of $J$ in its antiferromagnetic parent
compound Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8}$ has not been established. By combining
Raman scattering and x-ray diffraction techniques on the same sample in the
same pressure environment, we obtain the evolution of both the two-magnon
spectrum and the structural parameters with pressure up to nearly 30 GPa, The
relationship between pressure or the in-plane lattice parameter and $J$ is thus
established for Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8}$. Over the studied pressure range,
superconductivity does not appear in this parent compound based on a sensitive
magnetic measurement technique. The effects of pressure and chemical doping on
the superexchange interaction and structure and their implications for
superconductivity are discussed from the comparison of the obtained
experimental data with the existing experiments. The results and findings
provide valuable information for the understanding of superconductivity and the
future theory developments for superconductivity in cuprates.

<h3>Entanglement entropy for scale-invariant states: universal finite-size  scaling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11339" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11339</a>
<br>
<i>Huan-Qiang Zhou, Qian-Qian Shi, Ian P. McCulloch, Murray T. Batchelor</i>
<br>
<br>
A universal finite system-size scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy
is presented for highly degenerate ground states arising from spontaneous
symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes in exactly solvable
one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. These states appear to be
scale-invariant, but not conformally invariant. Our findings are based on a
physical argument, imposing three constraints on the entanglement entropy, in
addition to further confirmation from an asymptotic analysis of the
entanglement entropy for the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$1/2$ ferromagnetic states. The
resulting universal scaling form is demonstrated for three fundamental models
-- the ${\rm SU}(2)$ spin-$s$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model, the ${\rm
SU}(N+1)$ ferromagnetic model, and the staggered ${\rm SU}(3)$ spin-1
ferromagnetic biquadratic model. The results point towards a classification for
distinct types of scale-invariant states, relevant to a complete classification
of quantum states of matter.

<h3>Studies of 2D Material Resistive Random-Access Memory by Kinetic Monte  Carlo Simulation</h3>

<br>
Resistive memory based on 2D WS2, MoS2, and h-BN materials has been studied,
including experiments and simulations. The influences with different active
layer thicknesses have been discussed, including experiments and simulations.
The thickness with the best On/Off ratio is also found for the 2D RRAM. This
work reveals fundamental differences between a 2D RRAM and a conventional oxide
RRAM. Furthermore, from the physical parameters extracted with the KMC model,
the 2D materials have a lower diffusion activation energy from the vertical
direction, where a smaller bias voltage and a shorter switching time can be
achieved. It was also found the diffusion activation energy from the CVD-grown
sample is much lower than the mechanical exfoliated sample. The result shows
MoS2 has the fastest switching speed among three 2D materials.

<h3>Cavity-induced charge transfer in periodic systems: length-gauge  formalism</h3>

<br>
<br>
We develop a length-gauge formalism for treating one-dimensional periodic
lattice systems in the presence of a photon cavity inducing light-matter
interaction. The purpose of the formalism is to remove mathematical ambiguities
that occur when defining the position operator in the context of the
Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonian. We then use a diagrammatic approach to
analyze perturbatively the interaction between an electronic quantum system and
a photonic cavity mode of long wavelength. We illustrate the versatility of the
formalism by studying the cavity-induced electric charge imbalance and
polarization in the Rice-Mele model with broken inversion symmetry.

<h3>Dichotomous acceleration process</h3>

<br>
<i>Ion Santra, Durgesh Ajgaonkar, Urna Basu</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the motion of a one-dimensional particle which reverses its
direction of acceleration stochastically. We focus on two contrasting
scenarios, where the waiting-times between two consecutive acceleration
reversals are drawn from (i) an exponential distribution and (ii) a power-law
distribution with decay exponent $\alpha$. We compute the mean, variance and
short-time distribution of the position $x(t)$ using a trajectory-based
approach. We show that, while for the exponential waiting-time, $\langle
x^2(t)\rangle \sim t^3$ at long times, for the power-law case, a non-trivial
algebraic growth $\langle x^2(t)\rangle \sim t^{2\phi(\alpha)}$ emerges, where
$\phi(\alpha)=2$, $(5-\alpha)/2,$ and $3/2$ for $\alpha<1,~1<\alpha\leq 2$ and
$\alpha>2$, respectively. Interestingly, we find that the long-time position
distribution in case (ii) is a function of the scaled variable
$x/t^{\phi(\alpha)}$ with an $\alpha$-dependent scaling function, which has
qualitatively very different shapes for $\alpha<1$ and $\alpha>1$. In contrast,
for case (i), the typical long-time fluctuations of position are Gaussian.

<h3>Proposal for detecting the $π-$shifted Cooper quartet supercurrent</h3>

The multiterminal Josephson effect aroused considerable interest recently, in
connection with theoretical and experimental evidence for correlations among
Cooper pairs, that is, the so-called Cooper quartets. It was further predicted
that the spectrum of Andreev bound states in such devices could host Weyl-point
singularities. However, the relative phase between the Cooper pair and quartet
supercurrents has not yet been addressed experimentally. Here, we propose an
experiment involving four-terminal Josephson junctions with two independent
orthogonal supercurrents, and calculate the critical current contours (CCCs)
from a multiterminal Josephson junction circuit theory. We predict nonconvex
shapes for the CCCs in zero magnetic field, where the dissipative state
reenters into the superconducting one. This observation will allow providing
firm experimental evidence of the $\pi$-shifted Cooper quartet current-phase
relation.

<h3>Quantum transport theory for topological systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Chuan-Zhe Yao, Hon-Lam Lai, Wei-Min Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a transport theory for general topological systems based on our
exact master equation approach. The system-terminal transport dynamics is fully
captured with the nonequilibrium Green's function through the spectral density
matrices, and transport processes through topological states and
non-topological states can be manifested. The total transient transport current
is decomposed into components that describe coherent transports through
different paths of particle and hole channels. We then applied the transport
theory to a one-dimensional topological superconducting wire and further
analyzed the coherent transport through a pair of Majorana zero modes located
respectively at the two ends of the wire. We found that the coherent transport
currents through a pair of uncoupled Majorana zero modes vanish due to the
totally destructive interference between the particle and hole channels so that
no teleportation occurs through the non-locally separated Majorana zero modes.

<h3>Elastic Microphase Separation Produces Robust Bicontinuous Materials</h3>

Bicontinuous microstructures are essential to the function of diverse natural
and synthetic systems. Their synthesis has been based on two approaches:
arrested phase separation or self-assembly of block copolymers. The former is
attractive for its chemical simplicity, the latter for its thermodynamic
robustness. Here, we introduce Elastic MicroPhase Separation (EMPS) as an
alternative approach to make bicontinuous microstructures. Conceptually, EMPS
balances the molecular-scale forces that drive demixing with large-scale
elasticity to encode a thermodynamic length scale. This process features a
continuous phase transition, reversible without hysteresis. Practically, we
trigger EMPS by simply super-saturating an elastomeric matrix with a liquid.
This results in uniform bicontinuous materials with a well-defined microscopic
length-scale tuned by the matrix stiffness. The versatility and robustness of
EMPS is further demonstrated by fabricating bicontinuous materials with
superior mechanical properties and controlled anisotropy and microstructural
gradients.

Manifestation of orbital coupling of spin degree of freedom in condensed
matter systems has opened up a new dimension for the field of spintronics. The
most appealing aspect of the spin-orbit coupling is the apparent Magnus force
sensed by a spin system which locks the Fermi momentum with electron spin in a
fascinating manner. In the current carrying state, the resulting macroscopic
spin polarization becomes directly accessible in the form of spin current or
spin density. At a Rashba interface, for example, a charge current shifts the
spin-locked Fermi surface, leading to a non-equilibrium spin density at the
interface, commonly known as the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Since the
Rashba-Edelstein effect is an intrinsically interface property, direct
detection of the spin moment is harder to set-up. Here we demonstrate that a
simple planar Josephson Junction geometry, realized by placing two closely
spaced superconducting electrodes on such a Rashba interface, allows a direct
estimation of strength of the non-equilibrium spin moment. Measurements of
Fraunhofer patterns of Nb-(Pt/Cu)-Nb planar Josephson junctions in a
perpendicular magnetic field showed a shift of the center of the Fraunhofer
pattern to a non-zero field value. By performing extensive control
measurements, we argue that the screening currents in the junction effectively
lock the external field with the spin moment of the Rashba-Edelstein effect
induced spin-density, leading to the observed shift in the Fraunhofer patterns.
This simple experiment offers a fresh perspective on direct detection of spin
polarization induced by various spin-orbit effects. Very interestingly, this
device platform also offers the possibility of retaining a controllable phase
at zero field in the junction without using any magnetic material, and thereby
useful as phase batteries for superconducting quantum circuits.

<h3>A machine learning method to characterize the crack length and position  in high-density polyethylene using ultrasound</h3>

High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is a semi-crystalline polymer used in
several critical applications, ranging from cooling water pipelines in nuclear
power plants and natural gas and hydrogen pipelines to biomedical implants.
Embedded crack-like flaws form within HDPE during fabrication or operations.
Non-visible flaws grow over time and can cause catastrophic failure if
undetected. There is a lack of a non-destructive evaluation methodology that
can rapidly and accurately predict embedded crack length and position
simultaneously in large HDPE structures. Ultrasonic A-scan non-destructive
testing (NDT) allows for the rapid scan of large structures. Current NDT
methods rely on technical experts to evaluate the ultrasound measurements,
which leads to high uncertainty and errors as the quantitative information
about a crack is subtly encoded in the reflected signal. An optimally trained
machine learning model can decipher the crack characteristics, but a lack of
large, well-distributed, and labeled datasets to train machine learning models
continues to be a major limitation. We have conducted computer simulations of
ultrasound on HDPE to develop training data. We show that a fully finite
element simulations trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can accurately
predict crack lengths and positions in HDPE from experimentally measured
ultrasound A-scan signals, with an average error of 3.2% for the crack lengths
and 3.8% for the crack positions. Our method is based on fast acquired 1D time
amplitude signal and not based on 2D image analysis as the image rendering NDT
is very slow and susceptible to losing subtle crack features information during
the post-processing to create images. The proposed methodology presents a
pathway for training CNN using computationally-generated data and applying the
trained CNN to the field to quantify hidden cracks in large HDPE or other
polymer structures.

<br>
<br>
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a thin layer that dynamically forms
between active electrode and electrolyte during battery operation, critically
governs the performance of rechargeable batteries1-5. An ideal SEI is expected
to be electrically insulative to prevent persistently parasitic reactions
between the electrode and the electrolyte, while ionically conductive to
facilitate Faradaic reactions of the electrode1,2,6. However, the true nature
of the electrical properties of an SEI layer remains hitherto unclear due to
the lack of a direct characterization method, leaving a range of behaviors of
rechargeable batteries unelucidated. Here, we use in-situ bias transmission
electron microscopy, for the first time, to directly measure the electrical
properties of SEIs formed on copper (Cu) and lithium (Li) substrates.
Surprisingly, we discover that, in terms of electrical behavior, SEI is
distinctively different from a typical electrical insulator as what has been
widely, and up to date, assumed ever since the discovery of SEI; rather, SEI
shows voltage-dependent differential conductance.

<br>
<br>
Kagome lattice magnets are an interesting class of materials as they can host
topological properties in their magnetic and electronic structures. YMn6Sn6 is
one such compound in which a series of competing magnetic phases is stabilized
by an applied magnetic field, and both an enigmatic topological Hall effect and
a Dirac crossing close to the Fermi energy have been realized. This material
also shows a magnetization-induced Lifshitz transition and evidence of a unique
charge spin coupling in one of the magnetic phases, namely the fan-like phase.
Tuning the magnetism, and thus the interplay with the electronic states, opens
new avenues for precise control of these novel properties. Here, we demonstrate
the extreme sensitivity of the magnetic phases in YMn6Sn4Ge2 through the
investigation of structural, magnetic, and transport properties. The high
sensitivity to small doping provides great potential for engineering the
magnetic phases and associated electronic properties in this family of
rare-earth kagome magnets.

<h3>Charge-density waves do not lock in the "lock-in'' transition of  quasi-one-dimensional conductors</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11525</a>
<br>
<i>Katsuhiko Inagaki, Satoshi Tanda</i>
<br>
<br>
We studied the lock-in transition of charge-density waves in
quasi-one-dimensional conductors by numerical calculations. In contrast to
McMillan's pioneering work, no assumptions about the phase profile were made in
this work. We applied the simulated annealing and obtained more details than
those of the previous work. Quantitative analyses of the free energy revealed
that the lock-in transition in this system is from incommensurate not to
commensurate but to nearly commensurate. Our findings explained the
experimental results that in the lock-in transition of quasi-one-dimensional
conductors, such as blue bronze (K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$), charge density waves do not
fully lock into the commensurate wavelength at low temperatures. This could not
be understood by the previous work, which predicted the wavelength to lock into
the pristine lattice at the critical point.

<h3>Spin-triplet superconductivity from quantum-geometry-induced  ferromagnetic fluctuation</h3>

<br>
<i>Taisei Kitamura, Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that quantum geometry induces ferromagnetic fluctuation resulting in
spin-triplet superconductivity. The criterion for ferromagnetic fluctuation is
clarified by analyzing contributions from the effective mass and quantum
geometry. When the non-Kramers band degeneracy is present near the Fermi
surface, the Fubini-Study quantum metric strongly favors ferromagnetic
fluctuation. Solving the linearized gap equation with the effective interaction
obtained by the random phase approximation, we show that the spin-triplet
superconductivity is mediated by quantum-geometry-induced ferromagnetic
fluctuation.

<h3>Hierarchical bubble size distributions in coarsening wet liquid foams</h3>

<br>
<br>
Liquid foams are destabilized by three coupled processes: gravity drainage,
coalescence and coarsening. To focus on coarsening, coalescence can be
suppressed by using suitable surfactants, but it is more difficult to suppress
drainage, especially in wet foams where the liquid volume fraction is so large
that bubbles are approximately spherical. To investigate the structure and time
evolution of such foams, we have performed experiments in the International
Space Station. Our observations reveal an unexpected excess of small bubbles,
moving in the interstices of the randomly close-packed network of larger
bubbles. These "roaming bubbles" naturally appear during the coarsening
process. They were seemingly overlooked in previous ground-based foam
coarsening experiments. We have indeed detected roaming bubbles by performing
complementary studies of moderately wet foams $\phi \lesssim 10\%$ where
gravity can be counteracted on Earth by sample rotation. In foams with liquid
fractions beyond the random close packing fraction of sphere dispersions with
the same polydispersity as in our samples ($\phi > \phi_{\text{rcp}}$), the
excess of small bubbles disappears, but we observe that bubbles still tend to
remain connected due to weak adhesive interactions. A second transition is
observed at a larger liquid fraction $\phi^*$, above which the bubble size
distribution narrows, becoming similar to the one previously reported for
dilute coarsening dispersions (Ostwald ripening regime). We present models that
identify the physical mechanisms explaining our observations. Our results
suggest that, when solidified, coarsened wet liquid foams naturally have both
macropores (foam bubbles) and micropores (roaming bubbles). Materials with such
hierarchical structures can exhibit enhanced mechanical strength to density
ratios.

<h3>Conformational landscape of long semiflexible linear and ring polymers  near attractive surfaces</h3>

<br>
<i>Kamal Tripathi, Satyavani Vemparala</i>
<br>
<br>
Conformations of a crowded neutral semiflexible polymer under confinement
near an attractive wall are studied via coarse-grained simulations. We study
the effects of the interplay of the length of the polymer, bending rigidity,
and the repulsive crowder density on such equilibrium semiflexible polymer
conformations. The length of the polymer dictates the number of distinct
conformations of the adsorbed semiflexible polymer, suggesting that previous
studies of short polymers are limited. The crowder density is shown to
effectively reduce the bending rigidity of the polymers and at the highest
crowder density considered, a crumpled wall-adsorbed polymer conformation is
seen regardless of the semiflexibility. In addition, we study the role of the
topology of the semiflexible polymer by comparing the results of linear
semiflexible polymers with those of ring polymers. The conformational landscape
of crowded ring polymers shows less diversity than that of a linear polymer and
crowders are seen to affect the ring polymers differently than their linear
counterparts.

<h3>Dramatic Failure of the Callaway Description of Heat Flow in Boron  Arsenide Driven by Phonon Scattering Selection Rules</h3>

<br>
<i>Nikhil Malviya, Navaneetha K. Ravichandran</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that Callaway's simplified heat flow model in ultrahigh thermal
conductivity ($\kappa$) materials works exceptionally well for diamond and
boron nitride, but fails dramatically for boron arsenide (BAs) and boron
antimonide (BSb). This failure is driven by the inability of the Callaway model
to effectively describe the severely restricted phonon scattering in BAs and
BSb, where many scattering selection rules are activated simultaneously. Our
work gives insights into the nature of phonon scattering in ultrahigh-$\kappa$
materials and the suitability of the Callaway's description of heat flow
through them.

<h3>Resonant plasmonic detection of terahertz radiation in field-effect  transistors with the graphene channel and the black-As$_x$P$_{1-x}$ gate  layer</h3>

<i>V. Ryzhii, C. Tang, T. Otsuji, M. Ryzhii, V. Mitin, M. S. Shur</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose the terahertz (THz) detectors based on field-effect transistors
(FETs) with the graphene channel (GC) and the black-Arsenic (b-As)
black-Phosphorus (b-P), or black-Arsenic-Phosphorus (b-As$_x$P$_{1-x}$) gate
barrier layer. The operation of the GC-FET detectors is associated with the
carrier heating in the GC by the THz electric field resonantly excited by
incoming radiation leading to an increase in the rectified current between the
channel and the gate over the b-As$_x$P$_{1-x}$ energy barrier layer (BLs). The
specific feature of the GC-FETs under consideration is relatively low energy
BLs and the possibility to optimize the device characteristics by choosing the
barriers containing a necessary number of the b-As$_x$P$_{1-x}$ atomic layers
and a proper gate voltage. The excitation of the plasma oscillations in the
GC-FETs leads to the resonant reinforcement of the carrier heating and the
enhancement of the detector responsivity. The room temperature responsivity can
exceed the values of $10^3$~A/W. The speed of the GC-FET detector's response to
the modulated THz radiation is determined by the processes of carrier heating.
As shown, the modulation frequency can be in the range of several GHz at room
temperatures.

<h3>Stability of quantised vortices in two-component condensates</h3>

<br>
<i>Sam Patrick, Ansh Gupta, Ruth Gregory, Carlo F. Barenghi</i>
<br>
<br>
Multiply quantised vortices (MQVs) within single component Bose-Einstein
condensates are unstable and decay rapidly. We show that MQVs can be stabilised
by adding a small number of atoms of a second species to the vortex cores, and
that these atoms remain in the vortex core as the system evolves. A consequence
of the stabilisation is that nearby co-rotating vortices can orbit in the
opposite sense to their individual rotations when enough of the second species
is present. This has implications concerning the imaging of vortices, as well
as quantum turbulence and vortex nucleation in two-component condensates, such
as those involving mixtures of $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs.

We introduce a classification of the radial spin textures in momentum space
that emerge at high-symmetry points in crystals characterized by non-polar
chiral point groups ($D_2$, $D_3$, $D_4$, $D_6$, $T$, $O$). Based on the
symmetry constraints imposed by these point groups in a vector field, we study
the general expression for the radial spin textures up to third order in
momentum. Furthermore, we determine the high-symmetry points of the 45
non-polar chiral space groups supporting a radial spin texture. These two
principles are used to screen materials databases for archetypes that go beyond
the basic hedgehog radial spin texture. Among the selected materials we
highlight the axion insulator candidate $\mathrm{Ta}_2
\mathrm{Se}_8\mathrm{I}$, the material proposed for dark matter detection
$\mathrm{Ag}_3\mathrm{Au}\mathrm{Te}_2$ and heazlewoodite
$\mathrm{Ni}_3\mathrm{S}_2$, a conventional metal predicted to exhibit
current-induced spin polarization. We point out that the symmetry analysis
proposed in this Letter is more general and extends to studying other vector
properties in momentum space.

<br>
<br>
The scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) fabricated
on the tip of a sharp quartz pipette (SQUID-on-tip) has emerged as a versatile
tool for nanoscale imaging of magnetic, thermal, and transport properties of
microscopic devices of quantum materials. We present the design and performance
of a scanning SQUID-on-tip microscope in a top-loading probe of a cryogen-free
dilution refrigerator. The microscope is enclosed in a custom-made vacuum-tight
cell mounted at the bottom of the probe and is suspended by springs to suppress
vibrations caused by the pulse tube cryocooler. Two capillaries allow in-situ
control of helium exchange gas pressure in the cell that is required for
thermal imaging. A nanoscale heater is used to create local temperature
gradients in the sample, which enables quantitative characterization of the
relative vibrations between the tip and the sample. The spectrum of the
vibrations shows distinct resonant peaks with maximal power density of about 27
nm/Hz$^{1/2}$ in the in-plane direction. The performance of the SQUID-on-tip
microscope is demonstrated by magnetic imaging of the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ magnetic
topological insulator, magnetization and current distribution imaging in a
SrRuO$_3$ ferromagnetic oxide thin film, and by thermal imaging of dissipation
in graphene.

<br>
<br>
In this paper, the Ni Schottky barrier on GaN epilayer grown on free standing
substrates has been characterized. First, transmission electrical microscopy
(TEM) images and nanoscale electrical analysis by conductive atomic force
microscopy (C-AFM) of the bare material allowed visualizing structural defects
in the crystal, as well as local inhomogeneities of the current conduction. The
forward current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of Ni/GaN vertical Schottky
diodes fabricated on the epilayer gave average values of the Schottky barrier
height of 0.79 eV and ideality factor of 1.14. A statistical analysis over a
set of diodes, combined with temperature dependence measurements, confirmed the
formation of an inhomogeneous Schottky barrier in this material. From a plot of
FB versus n, an ideal homogeneous barrier close to 0.9 eV was estimated,
similar to that extrapolated by capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. Local I-V
curves, acquired by means of C-AFM, displayed the inhomogeneous distribution of
the onset of current conduction, which in turn resembles the one observed in
the macroscopic Schottky diodes. Finally, the reverse characteristic of the
diodes fabricated in the defects-free region have been acquired at different
temperature and its behaviour has been described by the thermionic field
emission (TFE) model.

<br>
<br>
We study thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of surface passivated silicon
nanowires (SiNWs) using large scale molecular dynamics simulations. Consistent
with the experimental observations, we find that bare SiNWs become unstable,
especially for small cross-section width $w$. We correlate this behavior with a
large excess energy $\Delta$ of the surface atoms with respect to bulk silicon
and propose a practically relevant method that uses $\Delta$ as a guiding tool
to obtain stable SiNWs. The surface stabilization is achieved by the surface
passivation of the silicon atoms with hydrogen or oxygen. As an added
advantage, $\kappa$ of a SiNW can be further tuned by changing the
concentration $c$ of the passivated atoms. By analyzing the phonon band
structures via spectral energy density (SED), we discuss separate contributions
from the surface and the core to $\kappa$ and show how passivation can help
tune the stiffness of SiNWs.

<br>
<br>
Based on the idea that the Dirac spin liquid is the parent state for numerous
competing orders, we propose the triangular lattice antiferromagnet
Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, which exhibits a quantum spin supersolid, to be a
precursory Dirac spin liquid. Despite the presence of a three-sublattice
magnetic order resembling a spin ``supersolid'', we suggest that this system is
close to a Dirac spin liquid by exploring its spectroscopic response. The
physical consequence is examined from the spectroscopic response, and we
establish the continuous spectra near the M point in addition to the K point
excitation from the spinon continuum on top of the three-sublattice order. This
proposal offers a plausible understanding of the recent inelastic neutron
scattering measurement in Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ and could inspire further
research in relevant models and materials.

Zinc Oxide is a thoroughly studied wide-bandgap semiconductor possessing
excellent optical and electronic properties at room temperature. The renewed
interest in this material has been generated by doping with various impurities
in order to further enhance versatile optoelectronic responses for practical
applications. Specifically, Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide is an emerging
transparent conducting oxide for photovoltaic applications. Here I propose to
conduct a series of experimental studies on broadband optical nonlinearity as
well as photoluminescence from Aluminum doped Zinc Oxide as a function of
Aluminum doping. The results of this study include studies including 1) Bandgap
measurements 2) wavelength-dependent third harmonic generation and 3)
one-photon-induced Photoluminescence. The most notable result is a multifold
enhanced third-order nonlinear optical response from weakly doped Aluminum
doped Zinc Oxide (up to 4%) in comparison with the undoped counterpart. The
observed nonlinear optical trend as a function of Aluminum doping is correlated
to the modification of the corresponding band structure. The Aluminum doping
effect is extensively investigated in the context of absorption and
Photoluminescence.

<br>
<br>
Bosons in periodic potentials with very strong local interactions, known as
the constrained bosons often exhibit interesting physical behavior. We
investigate the ground state properties of a two-leg Bose-Hubbard ladder by
imposing three-body constraint in one leg and hardcore constraint in the other.
By using the cluster-mean-field theory approximation and the density matrix
renormalization group method, we show that at unit filling, for strong two-body
attraction among the three-body constrained bosons, the system becomes a gapped
pair-Mott insulator where all the bosons form strong bound pairs and occupy the
leg with three-body constraint. With increase in hopping strength this
pair-Mott insulator phase undergoes a phase transition to the gapless
superfluid phase for equal leg and rung hopping strengths. However, when the
rung hopping is stronger compared to the leg hopping, we obtain a crossover to
another gapped phase which is called the rung-Mott insulator phase where the
bosons prefer to delocalize on the rungs than the legs. By moving away from
unit filling, the system remains in the superfluid phase except for a small
region below the gapped phase where a pair superfluid phase is stabilized in
the regime of strong attractive interaction. We further extend our studies by
considering three-body constraint on both the legs and find that the crossover
from the gapped to gapped phase does not occur rather the system undergoes a
transition from a pair-rung-Mott insulator phase to the superfluid phase at
unit filling. Moreover, in this case we find the signature of the pair
superfluid phase on either sides of this gapped phase.

<h3>Thermodynamic cost of Brownian computers in the stochastic  thermodynamics of resetting</h3>

<br>
<br>
We analyze the thermodynamic cost of a logically reversible Brownian Turing
machine operating in the first-passage time protocol based on the stochastic
thermodynamics of resetting. In this framework, the thermodynamic cost of
computation is the reset entropy production, which is interpreted as the
information reduction by a resetter external to the computer. At the level of a
single trajectory, the reset entropy production is associated with
unidirectional transitions and is a function of the time-dependent distribution
probability. We analyze an approximation that replaces the distribution
probability with the empirical sojourn time, which can be obtained at the
single-trajectory level. The approximation is suitable for the numerical
analysis by the Gillespie algorithm and provides a reasonable average value for
the reset entropy.

<h3>Electronic Correlation-driven Exotic Quantum Phase Transitions in  Infinite-layer Manganese Oxide</h3>

<i>Heng Jin, Bing Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite the intensive interest in copper- and nickel-based superconductivity
in infinite-layer structures, the physical properties of many other
infinite-layer transition-metal oxides remain largely unknown. Here we unveil,
by the first-principles calculations, the electronic correlation-driven quantum
phase transitions in infinite-layer SrMnO2, where spin and charge orders are
strongly interwoven. At weak electronic correlation region, SrMnO2 is a
ferromagnetic metal with anisotropic spin transportation, as a promising spin
valve under room-temperature. At middle electronic correlation region, a
structural transition accompanied by charge/bond disproportion occurs as a
consequence of Fermi surface nesting, resulting in a ferromagnetic insulator
with reduced Curie temperature. At strong electronic correlation region,
another structural transition occurs that drives the system into degenerately
antiferromagnetic insulators with tunable magnetic order by piezoelectricity, a
new type of multiferroics. Therefore, infinite-layer SrMnO2 is possibly a
unique system on the quantum critical point, where electronic correlation can
induce noticeable Fermi surface evolutions and small perturbations can realize
remarkable quantum phase transitions.

<br>
<br>
The topological Hall effect (THE) is critical to the exploration of the spin
chirality generated by the real-space Berry curvature, which has attracted
worldwide attention for its prospective applications in spintronic devices.
However, the prominent THE remains elusive at room temperature, which severely
restricts the practical integration of chiral spin textures. Here, we show a
colossal intrinsic THE in large-area ferromagnet Cr5Te6 thin films epitaxially
grown by pulsed laser deposition. Such a THE can be maintained until 270 K,
which is attributed to the field-stimulated noncoplanar spin textures induced
by the interaction of the in-plane ferromagnet and antiferromagnet
infrastructures. Our first-principles calculations further verify the
considerable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in Cr5Te6. This work not only
paves the way for robust chiral spin textures near room temperature in
large-area low-dimensional ferromagnetic films for practical applications, but
also facilitates the development of high-density and dissipationless spintronic
devices.

frequency f increases, two distinct critical dynamics arise in the generation
of half-quantum vortices (HQVs) with different spin circulations.
Spin-$\uparrow$ vortices are nucleated directly from the moving obstacle at low
f, while spin-$\downarrow$ vortices are created at high f by breaking a spin
wave pulse in front of the obstacle. We find that vortex generation is
suppressed for sufficiently weak obstacles, in agreement with recent
experimental results by Kim et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 095302 (2021)]. This
suppression is caused by the finite sweeping distance of the oscillating
obstacle and the reduction in friction in a supersonic regime. Finally, we show
that the characteristic length scale of the HQV generation dynamics is
determined by the spin healing length of the system.

<br>
<br>
Recent experiments on Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) deposited on monolayer
WSe$_2$ revealed robust, ultra-clean superconductivity coexisting with sizable
induced spin-orbit coupling. Here we propose BLG/WSe$_2$ as a platform to
engineer gate-defined planar topological Josephson junctions, where the normal
and superconducting regions descend from a common material. More precisely, we
show that if superconductivity in BLG/WSe$_2$ is gapped and emerges from a
parent state with inter-valley coherence, then Majorana zero modes can form in
the barrier region upon applying weak in-plane magnetic fields. Our results
spotlight a potential pathway for `internally engineered' topological
superconductivity that minimizes detrimental disorder and
orbital-magnetic-field effects.

We investigate $p$-wave superconducting quasiperiodic systems with staggered
potential and report for the first time a phase transition featuring reversion
from the intermediate to the extended phase, which we dubbed as recurrent
extension phase transition (REPT). Besides, different from the traditional
intermediate phase consisting only of the extended and localized phases, we
find that three novel intermediate phases containing the critical phase have
appeared in the system, i.e., they are intermediate phases composed of the
critical + extended phases, the critical + localized phases, and the critical +
extended + localized phases, respectively. The prediction in this Letter can
not only enrich our understanding of Anderson localization and mobility edge,
but also open a new avenue for further research on exotic intermediate phases.

<h3>Nature of charge density wave in kagome metal ScV6Sn6</h3>

<br>
Kagome lattice materials offer a fertile ground to discover novel quantum
phases of matter, ranging from unconventional superconductivity and quantum
spin liquids to charge orders of various profiles. However, understanding the
genuine origin of the quantum phases in kagome materials is often challenging,
owing to the intertwined atomic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom.
Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, phonon mode
calculation, and chemical doping to elucidate the driving mechanism of the
root3*root3 charge order in a newly discovered kagome metal ScV6Sn6. In
contrast to the case of the archetype kagome system AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, Cs), the
van Hove singularities in ScV6Sn6 remain intact across the charge order
transition, indicating a marginal role of the electronic instability from the V
kagome lattice. Instead, we identified a three-dimensional band with dominant
planar Sn character opening a large charge order gap of 260 meV and strongly
reconstructing the Fermi surface. Our complementary phonon dispersion
calculations further emphasize the role of the structural components other than
the V kagome lattice by revealing the unstable planar Sn and Sc phonon modes
associated to the root3*root3 phase. Finally, in the constructed phase diagram
of Sc(V1-xCrx)6Sn6, the charge order remains robust in a wide doping range x =
0 ~ 0.10 against the Fermi level shift up to ~ 120 meV, further making the
electronic scenarios such as Fermi surface or saddle point nesting unlikely.
Our multimodal investigations demonstrate that the physics of ScV6Sn6 is
fundamentally different from the canonical kagome metal AV3Sb5, uncovering a
new mechanism to induce symmetry-breaking phase transition in kagome lattice
materials.

<h3>Machine learning for predicting fatigue properties of additively  manufactured materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11828" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11828</a>
<br>
<i>Min Yi, Ming Xue, Peihong Cong, Yang Song, Haiyang Zhang, Lingfeng Wang, Liucheng Zhou, Yinghong Li, Wanlin Guo</i>
<br>
<br>
Fatigue properties of additively manufactured (AM) materials depend on many
factors such as AM processing parameter, microstructure, residual stress,
surface roughness, porosities, post-treatments, etc. Their evaluation
inevitably requires these factors combined as many as possible, thus resulting
in low efficiency and high cost. In recent years, their assessment by
leveraging the power of machine learning (ML) has gained increasing attentions.
Here, we present a comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art progress of
applying ML strategies to predict fatigue properties of AM materials, as well
as their dependence on AM processing and post-processing parameters such as
laser power, scanning speed, layer height, hatch distance, built direction,
post-heat temperature, etc. A few attempts in employing feedforward neural
network (FNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), adaptive network-based fuzzy
system (ANFS), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) to predict
fatigue life and RF to predict fatigue crack growth rate are summarized. The ML
models for predicting AM materials' fatigue properties are found intrinsically
similar to the commonly used ones, but are modified to involve AM features.
Finally, an outlook for challenges (i.e., small dataset, multifarious features,
overfitting, low interpretability, unable extension from AM material data to
structure life) and potential solutions for the ML prediction of AM materials'
fatigue properties is provided.

<h3>Fractional Chern Insulator in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
A recent experiment has reported the first observation of a zero-field
fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phase in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ moir\'e
superlattices (arXiv: 2304.08470). The experimental observation is at an
unexpected large twist angle 3.7$^\circ$ and calls for a better understanding
of the FCI in real materials. In this work, we perform large-scale density
functional theory calculation for the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, and find that
lattice reconstruction is crucial for the appearance of an isolated flat Chern
band. The existence of the FCI state at $\nu = -2/3$ are confirmed by exact
diagonalization. We establish phase diagrams with respect to the twist angle
and electron interaction, which reveal an optimal twist angle of $3.5^\circ$
for the observation of FCI. We further demonstrate that an external electric
field can destroy the FCI state by changing band geometry and show evidence of
the $\nu=-3/5$ FCI state in this system. Our research highlights the importance
of accurate single particle band structure in the quest for strong correlated
electronic states and provides insights into engineering fractional Chern
insulator in moir\'e superlattices.

<h3>Stochastic Heat Engine Using Multiple Interacting Active Particles</h3>

<br>
<br>
The area of stochastic heat engines using active particles has attracted a
lot of attention recently. They have been shown to exhibit advantages over
engines using passive particles. In this work, we use multiple self-propelling
particles undergoing Vicsek-like aligning interaction as our working system.
The particles are confined in a two-dimensional circular trap. The interplay
between the confinement and the activity of the particles induces clustering.
These clusters change their locations relative to the walls of the trap, when
the wall steepness is varied with time. In this work we demonstrate that
changing the steepness of the wall and the activity of the particles
time-periodically can cause the system to act as an engine. In this setup, we
study the variations in extracted work with the activity, rotational diffusion,
and the Vicsek radius of individual particles. We also comment on the
complications involved in the definition of the engine efficiency in accordance
with the usual prescription of stochastic thermodynamics.

<h3>Gate-tunable ferromagnetism in a van der Waals magnetic semimetal</h3>

<br>
<i>Hideki Matsuoka, Shun Kajihara, Yue Wang, Yoshihiro Iwasa, Masaki Nakano</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic semimetals form an attractive class of materials because of the
non-trivial contributions of itinerant electrons to magnetism. Due to their
relatively low-carrier-density nature, a doping level of those materials could
be largely tuned by a gating technique. Here we demonstrate gate-tunable
ferromagnetism in an emergent van der Waals magnetic semimetal Cr3Te4 based on
an ion-gating technique. Upon doping electrons into the system, the Curie
temperature (TC) sharply increases, approaching near to room temperature, then
decreases to some extent. Interestingly, this non-monotonous variation of TC
accompanies the switching of the magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, such
evolutions of TC and anisotropy occur synchronously with the sigh changes of
the ordinary and anomalous Hall effects. Those results clearly elucidate that
the magnetism in Cr3Te4 should be governed by its semimetallic band nature,
where the band crossing points play a crucial role both for the
magneto-transport properties and magnetism itself.

<br>
<br>
Quantum phenomena at interfaces create functionalities at the level of
materials. Ferromagnetism in van der Waals systems with diverse arrangements of
spins opened a pathway for utilizing proximity magnetic fields to activate
properties of materials which would otherwise require external stimuli.
Herewith, we realize this notion via creating heterostructures comprising bulk
CrCl$_3$ ferromagnet with in-plane easy-axis magnetization and monolayer
WSe$_2$ semiconductor. We demonstrate that the in-plane component of the
proximity field activates the dark excitons within WSe$_2$. Zero-external-field
emission from the dark states allowed us to establish the in-plane and
out-of-plane components of the proximity field via inspection of the emission
intensity and Zeeman effect, yielding canted orientations at the degree range
of $10^{\circ}$ $-$ $30^{\circ}$ at different locations of the
heterostructures, attributed to the features of interfacial topography. Our
findings are relevant for the development of spintronics and valleytronics with
long-lived dark states in technological timescales and sensing applications of
local magnetic fields realized simultaneously in multiple dimensions.

<h3>Fast dynamics and high effective dimensionality of liquid fluidity</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Fluidity, the ability of liquids to flow, is the key property distinguishing
liquids from solids. This fluidity is set by the mobile transit atoms moving
from one quasi-equilibrium oscillatory point to the next. The nature of this
transit motion is unknown. Here, we show that flow-enabling transits form a
dynamically distinct sub-ensemble where atoms move on average faster than the
overall system and which has a manifestly non-Maxwellian velocity distribution.
This is in contrast to solids and gases where no such distinction of different
ensembles can be made and where the velocity distribution is always Maxwellian.
The non-Maxwellian distribution of transits can be described by an exponent
{\alpha} corresponding to high effective dimensionality of space. This
dimensionality is close to 4 at melting and exceeds 4 at high temperature.
{\alpha} has a maximum as a function of temperature and pressure in liquid and
supercritical states, returning to its Maxwell value in the solid and gas
states

The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a foundational model in topological
insulators and is also relevant for understanding higher-order topological
phases. This study explores the relationship between $n$-dimensional SSH models
and their $n-1$ dimensional counterparts, identifying a hierarchical structure
that allows us to solve an arbitrary $n$-dimensional SSH model analytically. We
also introduce a generalization of the bulk-edge correspondence principle to
arbitrary dimensions using the Zak phase. Additionally, we compare the
$n$-dimensional SSH model with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, another
important model in higher-order topological phases.

<br>
<br>
Revealing the energy and spatial characteristics of impurity induced states
in superconductors is essential for understanding their mechanism and
fabricating new quantum state by manipulating impurities. Here by using
high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we investigated the
spatial distribution and magnetic field response of the impurity states in
(Li1-xFex)OHFeSe. We detected two pairs of strong in-gap states on the
"dumbbell" shaped defects. They display clear damped oscillations with
different phase shifts and a direct phase-energy correlation. These features
have long been predicted for classical Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state, which are
demonstrated here with unprecedented resolution for the first time. Moreover,
upon applying magnetic field, all the in-gap state peaks remarkably split into
two rather than shift, and the splitting strength is field orientation
dependent. Via detailed numerical model calculations, we found such anisotropic
splitting behavior can be naturally induced by a high-spin impurity coupled to
anisotropic environment, highlighting how magnetic anisotropy affects the
behavior of YSR states.

<h3>Tensor network approach to the fully frustrated XY kagome  antiferromagnets with a fractional vortex-antivortex pairing transition</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11944" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11944</a>
<br>
<i>Feng-Feng Song, Guang-Ming Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
We have developed a tensor network approach to the two-dimensional fully
frustrated classical XY spin model on the kagome lattice, and clarified the
nature of the possible phase transitions of various topological excitations. We
found that the standard tensor network representation for the partition
function does not work in the presence of strong frustrations in the low
temperature limit. To avoid the direct truncation of the Boltzmann weight,
based on the duality transformation of the model Hamiltonian, we introduced a
new representation to build the tensor network. Then the partition function is
expressed as a product of one-dimensional transfer matrix operators, whose
eigen-equation can be solved by the variational uniform matrix product state
algorithm accurately. The singularity of the entanglement entropy for this
one-dimensional quantum operator provides a stringent criterion for the
possible phase transitions. Through a systematic analysis of thermodynamic
properties and correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit, the model
exhibits a single Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition only, which
is driven by the unbinding of $1/3$ vortex-antivortex pairs accurately
determined at $T_{c}\simeq 0.075J_{1}$. The absence of long-range order of
chirality or quasi-long range order of integer vortices is verified in the
whole range of temperature. Thus the long-standing controversy about the phase
transitions in this fully frustrated kagome antiferromagnet is solved
rigorously, providing a plausible way to understand the charge-6e
superconducting phase observed experimentally in the kagome superconductors.

<i>Pierre Nazé</i>
<br>
<br>
The optimal protocols for the irreversible work achieve their maximum
usefulness if their work fluctuations are the smallest ones. In this work, for
isothermal processes subjected to finite-time and weak drivings, I show using
the linear-response theory that the optimal protocol for the irreversible work
is the same for the variance of work. This conclusion is based on the work
fluctuation-dissipation theorem $\overline{W}=\Delta F+\beta \sigma_W^2/2$,
extended now to finite-time and weak drivings. To illustrate such a relation, I
analyze the example of an overdamped Brownian motion subjected to an anharmonic
stiffening trap and white noise for fast processes. By contrast with the
already known results in the literature for classical systems, the
linear-response theory approach of the work probabilistic distribution is not a
Gaussian reduction.

<br>
<br>
We introduce a Monte-Carlo method that allows for the simulation of a
polymeric phase containing a weak polyelectrolyte, which is coupled to a
reservoir at a fixed pH, salt concentration and total concentration of a weak
polyprotic acid. The method generalizes the established Grand-Reaction Method
by Landsgesell et al. [Macromolecules 53, 3007-3020 (2020)] and thus allows for
the simulation of polyelectrolyte systems coupled to reservoirs with a more
complex chemical composition. In order to set the required input parameters
that correspond to a desired reservoir composition, we propose a generalization
of the recently published chemical potential tuning algorithm of Miles et al.
[Phys. Rev. E 105, 045311 (2022)]. To test the proposed tuning procedure, we
perform extensive numerical tests for both ideal and interacting systems.
Finally, as a showcase, we apply the method to a simple test system which
consists of a weak polybase solution that is coupled to a reservoir containing
a small diprotic acid. The complex interplay of the ionization various species,
the electrostatic interactions and the partitioning of small ions leads to a
non-monotonous, stepwise swelling behaviour of the weak polybase chains.

Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have attracted a lot of
attention because modern preparation techniques are capable of providing single
crystal films of these materials with precise control of thickness down to the
single-layer limit. It opens up a way to study rich variety of electronic and
magnetic phenomena with promising routes towards potential applications. We
have investigated the initial stages of epitaxial growth of the magnetic van
der Waals semiconductor FeBr\textsubscript{2} on a single-crystal Au(111)
substrate by means of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy
electron diffraction, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, low-energy electron
emission microscopy and x-ray photoemission electron microscopy. Magnetic
properties of the one- and two-layer thick films were measured via x-ray
absorption spectroscopy/x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. Our findings show a
striking difference in the magnetic behaviour of the single layer of
FeBr\textsubscript{2} and its bulk counterpart, which can be attributed to the
modifications in the crystal structure due to the interaction with the
substrate.

In this study structural and mechanical properties of a 1 um thick Al2O3
coating, deposited on 316L stainless steel by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD),
subjected to high energy ion irradiation were assessed. Mechanical properties
of pristine and ion-modified specimens were investigated using the
nanoindentation technique. A comprehensive characterization combining
Transmission Electron Microscopy and Grazing-Incidence X-ray Diffraction
provided deep insight into the structure of the tested material at the nano-
and micro- scale. Variation in the local atomic ordering of the irradiated zone
at different doses was investigated using a reduced distribution function
analysis obtained from electron diffraction data. Findings from nanoindentation
measurements revealed a slight reduction in hardness of all irradiated layers.
At the same time TEM examination indicated that the irradiated layer remained
amorphous over the whole dpa range. No evidence of crystallization, void
formation or element segregation was observed up to the highest implanted dose.
Reported mechanical and structural findings were critically compared with each
other pointing to the conclusion that under given irradiation conditions, over
the whole range of doses used, alumina coatings exhibit excellent radiation
resistance. Obtained data strongly suggest that investigated material may be
considered as a promising candidate for next-generation nuclear reactors,
especially LFR-type, where high corrosion protection is one of the highest
prerogatives to be met.

It is well known that ion irradiation can be successfully used to reproduce
microstructural features triggered by neutron irradiation. Even though the
irradiation process brings many benefits, it is also associated with several
drawbacks. For example, the penetration depth of the ion in the material is
very limited. This is particularly important for energies below MeV, ultimately
reducing the number of available irradiation facilities. In addition to that,
extracting information exclusively from the modified volume may be challenging.
Therefore, extreme caution must be taken when interpreting obtained data. Our
work aims to compare the findings of nanomechanical studies already conducted
separately on thin amorphous ceramic coatings irradiated with ions of different
energies, hence layers of different thicknesses. In this work, we show that in
some instances, the 10% rule may be obeyed. In order to prove our finding, we
compared results obtained for ion irradiated (with two energies: 0.25 and 1.2
MeV up to 25dpa) alumina coating system. Mechanical properties of pristine and
ion-irradiated specimens were studied by nanoindentation technique.
Interestingly, the qualitative relationship between nanohardness and
irradiation damage level is very similar, regardless of the energy used. The
presented work proves that for some materials (e.g., hard coatings), the
qualitative assessment of the mechanical changes using nanoindentation might be
feasible even for shallow implantation depths.

Optical pump-probe techniques like absorption spectroscopy and microwave
conductivity are widely used to characterize the carrier dynamics in
perovskites for optoelectronic applications. In contrast to the prevalent
assumption of exponentials, here we predict the possibility of trap emission
limited logarithmic and power-law transients. These predictions are validated
by detailed numerical simulations and well supported by several experimental
reports from recent literature. Interestingly, these findings indicate the need
to revisit the existing schemes which rely on simplified rate equations and
exponential decays to estimate the recombination parameters from pump-probe
spectroscopy. Accordingly, we suggest appropriate methodologies to back extract
parameters related to trap distribution from such non-exponential transients.
Indeed, the insights shared in this manuscript could fundamentally impact the
usage and interpretation of transient spectroscopy for emerging materials for
optoelectronic applications.

In recent years, various classes of systems were proposed to realize
topological states of matter. One of them are multiterminal Josephson junctions
where topological Andreev bound states are constructed in the synthetic space
of superconducting phases. Crucially, the topology in these systems results in
a quantized transconductance between two of its terminals comparable to the
quantum Hall effect. In this work, we study a double quantum dot with four
superconducting terminals and show that it has an experimentally accessible
topological regime in which the non-trivial topology can be measured. We also
include Coulomb repulsion between electrons which is usually present in
experiments and show how the topological region can be maximized in parameter
space.

The physical properties of crystals are governed by their symmetry according
to Neumann's principle. However, we present a case that contradicts this
principle wherein the polarization is not invariant under its symmetry. We term
this phenomenon as unconventional ferroelectricity in violation of Neumann's
principle (UFVNP). Our group theory analysis reveals that 33 symmorphic space
groups have the potential for UFVNP, with 26 of these symmorphic space groups
belonging to non-polar groups. Notably, the polarization component in UFVNP
materials is quantized. Our theory can explain the experimentally proven
in-plane polarization of the monolayer {\alpha}-In2Se3, which has C3v symmetry.
Additionally, we employ first-principles calculations to demonstrate the
existence of UFVNP in Td phase AgBr, which was not initially anticipated to
exhibit polarization. Thus, UFVNP plays an integral role in characterizing and
exploring the possible applications of ferroelectrics, significantly expanding
the range of available materials for study.

The $\pm J$ Ising model is a simple frustrated spin model, where the exchange

$+J$ with probability $1-p$. It is especially appealing due to its connection
to quantum error correcting codes. Here, we investigate the nonequilibrium
critical behavior of the bi-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model, after a quench
from different initial conditions to a critical point $T_c(p)$ on the
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic (PF) transition line, especially, above, below and
at the multicritical Nishimori point (NP). The dynamical critical exponent
$z_c$ seems to exhibit non-universal behavior for quenches above and below the
NP, which is identified as a pre-asymptotic feature due to the repulsive fixed
point at the NP. Whereas, for a quench directly to the NP, the dynamics reaches
the asymptotic regime with $z_c \simeq 6.02(6)$. We also consider the
geometrical spin clusters (of like spin signs) during the critical dynamics.
Each universality class on the PF line is uniquely characterized by the
stochastic Loewner evolution (SLE) with corresponding parameter $\kappa$.
Moreover, for the critical quenches from the paramagnetic phase, the model,
irrespective of the frustration, exhibits an emergent critical percolation
topology at the large length scales.

Non-volatile manipulation of valley polarization in solids has long been
desired for valleytronics applications but remains challenging. Here, we
propose a novel strategy for non-volatile manipulating valleys through bilayer
stacking, which enables spontaneous valley polarization without breaking
time-reversal symmetry. We call this noval physics as bilayer stacking
ferrovalley (BSFV). The group theory analysis reveals that the two-dimensional
(2D) valley materials with hexagonal and square lattices can host BSFV. By
searching the 2D material database, we discovered 14 monolayer 2D materials
with direct gaps that are candidates for realizing BSFV. Further
first-principles calculations demonstrate that BSFV exists in RhCl3 and InI
bilayers. The bilayer stacking breaks their three- and four-fold rotation
symmetry, resulting in 39 and 326 meV valley polarization, respectively. More
interestingly, the valley polarization in our systems can be switched by
interlayer sliding. Our study opens up a new direction for designing
ferrovalley materials and thus greatly enriches the platform for the research
of valleytronics.

Block copolymers are recognised as a valuable platform for creating
nanostructured materials with unique properties. Morphologies formed by block
copolymer self-assembly can be transferred into a wide range of inorganic
materials, enabling applications including energy storage and metamaterials.
However, imaging of the underlying, often complex, nanostructures in large
volumes has remained a challenge, limiting progress in materials development.
Taking advantage of recent advances in X-ray nanotomography, we non-invasively
imaged exceptionally large volumes of nanostructured soft materials at high
resolution, revealing a single diamond morphology in a triblock terpolymer
composite network. This morphology, which is ubiquitous in nature, has so far
remained elusive in block copolymers, despite its potential to create materials
with large photonic bandgaps. The discovery was made possible by the precise
analysis of distortions in a large volume of the self-assembled diamond
network, which are difficult to unambiguously assess using traditional
characterisation tools. We anticipate that high-resolution X-ray
nanotomography, which allows imaging of much larger sample volumes than
electron-based tomography, will become a powerful tool for the quantitative
analysis of complex nanostructures and that structures such as the triblock
terpolymer-directed single diamond will enable the generation of advanced
multicomponent composites with hitherto unknown property profiles.

The photovoltaic cell based on p-GaN film/n-ZnO micro rods quasi array
heterojunction was fabricated. According to the scanning electron microscopy
data, the ZnO array consisted of the tightly packed vertical micro rods with a

<h3>Front propagation in ultrastable glasses is dynamically heterogeneous</h3>

<br>
<br>
Upon heating, ultrastable glassy films transform into liquids via a
propagating equilibration front, resembling the heterogeneous melting of
crystals. A microscopic understanding of this robust phenomenology is however
lacking because experimental resolution is limited. We simulate the
heterogeneous transformation kinetics of ultrastable configurations prepared
using the swap Monte Carlo algorithm, thus allowing direct comparison with
experiments. We resolve the liquid-glass interface both in space and time as
well as the underlying particle motion responsible for its propagation. We
perform a detailed statistical analysis of the interface geometry and kinetics
over a broad range of temperatures. We show that the dynamic heterogeneity of
the bulk liquid is passed on to the front which propagates heterogeneously in
space and intermittently in time. This observation allows us to relate the
averaged front velocity to the equilibrium diffusion coefficient of the liquid.
We suggest that an experimental characterisation of the interface geometry
during the heterogeneous devitrification of ultrastable glassy films would
provide direct experimental access to the long-sought characteristic
lengthscale of dynamic heterogeneity in bulk supercooled liquids.

<br>
<br>
Thermal greases, often used as thermal interface materials, are complex
paste-like mixtures composed of a base polymer in which dense metallic (or
ceramic) filler particles are dispersed to improve the heat transfer properties
of the material. They have complex rheological properties that impact the
performance of the thermal interface material over its lifetime. We perform
rheological experiments on thermal greases and observe both stress relaxation
and stress buildup regimes. This time-dependent rheological behavior of such
complex fluid-like materials is not captured by steady shear-thinning models
often used to describe these materials. We find that thixo-elasto-visco-plastic
(TEVP) and nonlinear-elasto-visco-plastic (NEVP) constitutive models
characterize the observed stress relaxation and buildup regimes respectively.
Specifically, we use the models within a data-driven approach based on
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). PINNs are used to solve the inverse
problem of determining the rheological model parameters from the dynamic
response in experiments. This training data is generated by startup flow
experiments at different (constant) shear rates using a shear rheometer. We
validate the ``learned'' models by comparing their predicted shear stress
evolution to experiments under shear rates not used in the training data sets.
We further validate the learned TEVP model by solving a forward problem
numerically to determine the shear stress evolution for an input step-strain
profile. Meanwhile, the NEVP model is further validated by comparison to a
steady Herschel--Bulkley fit of the material's flow curve.

Condensed matter systems offer the opportunity to maximize the number of
spins, probed in magnetic resonance experiments that search for physics beyond
the standard model. EuCl$_3\cdot 6$H$_2$O is a promising solid-state platform
for such searches. The narrow inhomogeneous linewidth of the Eu optical
$^7\hspace{-0.1em}F_0 \leftrightarrow\,^5\hspace{-0.1em}D_0$ transition in this
material opens the opportunity to optically pump the $^{153}$Eu nuclear spin
ensemble into a single hyperfine sublevel. The closely-spaced opposite-parity
nuclear energy levels, and the low-energy collective octupole mode, or a
possible static octupole deformation, enhance the $^{153}$Eu nuclear Schiff
moment. The optimistic estimate of the effective electric field is
$E^*=10\,$MV/cm. With this estimate, the CASPEr-electric search for the gluon
interaction of axion dark matter can reach QCD axion sensitivity with a 3~cm

<br>
We used the asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
technique to extract the current phase relation (CPR) of a Josephson junction
with a 3D-topological insulator (TI) Bi2Se3 nanobelt as the barrier. The
obtained CPR shows deviations from the standard sinusoidal CPR with a
pronounced forward skewness. At temperatures below 200 mK, the junction
skewness values are above the zero temperature limit for short diffusive
junctions. Fitting of the extracted CPR shows that most of the supercurrent is
carried by ballistic topological surface states (TSSs), with a small
contribution of diffusive channels primarily due to the bulk. These findings
are instrumental in engineering devices that can fully exploit the properties
of the topologically protected surface states of 3D TIs.

Cats use the connection governing parallel transport in the space of shapes
to land safely on their feet. Here we argue that this connection also explains
the impressive performance of molecular motors by enabling molecules to evade
conclusions of Feynman's ratchet-and-pawl analysis. We first demonstrate, using
simple molecular models, how directed rotational motion can emerge from shape
changes even without angular momentum. We then computationally design knotted
polyalanine molecules and show how their shape space connection organizes
individual atom thermal vibrations into collective rotational motion,
independently of angular momentum. Our simulations show that rotational motion
arises effortlessly even in ambient water, making the molecule an effective
theory time crystal. Our findings have potential for practical molecular motor
design and engineering and can be verified through high-precision nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements.

<h3>Inverse design of multishape metamaterials</h3>

<br>
<br>
Multishape metamaterials exhibit more than one target shape change, e.g. the
same metamaterial can have either a positive or negative Poisson's ratio. So
far, multishape metamaterials have mostly been obtained by trial-and-error. The
inverse design of multiple target deformations in such multishape metamaterials
remains a largely open problem. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to
design metamaterials with multiple nonlinear deformations of arbitrary
complexity. To this end, we introduce a novel sequential nonlinear method to
design multiple target modes. We start by iteratively adding local constraints
that match a first specific target mode; we then continue from the obtained
geometry by iteratively adding local constraints that match a second target
mode; and so on. We apply this sequential method to design up to 3 modes with
complex shapes and we show that this method yields at least an 85% success
rate. Yet we find that these metamaterials invariably host additional spurious
modes, whose number grows with the number of target modes and their complexity,
as well as the system size. Our results highlight an inherent trade-off between
design freedom and design constraints and pave the way towards multi-functional
materials and devices.

<h3>Synchronization and spacetime vortices in one-dimensional  driven-dissipative condensates and coupled oscillator models</h3>

<i>John P. Moroney, Paul R. Eastham</i>
<br>
<br>
Driven-dissipative condensates, such as those formed from polaritons, expose
how the coherence of Bose-Einstein condensates evolves far from equilibrium. We
consider the phase and frequency ordering in the steady-states of a
one-dimensional lattice of condensates, described by a coupled oscillator model
with non-odd couplings, and include both time-dependent noise and a static
random potential. We present numerical results for the phase and frequency
distributions, and discuss them in terms of the Kardar-Paraisi-Zhang equation
and the physics of spacetime vortices. We find that the nucleation of spacetime
vortices causes the breakdown of the single-frequency steady-state and produces
a variation in the frequency with position. Such variation would provide an
experimental signature of spacetime vortices. More generally, our results
expose the nature of sychronization in oscillator chains with non-odd
couplings, random frequencies, and noise.

We theoretically predict the squeezing-induced point-gap topology together
with a {\it symmetry-protected $\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect} in a one-dimensional
(1D) quadratic-bosonic system (QBS). Protected by a time-reversal symmetry,
such a topology is associated with a novel $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant (similar to
quantum spin-Hall insulators), which is fully capable of characterizing the
occurrence of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect. Focusing on zero energy, the
parameter regime of this skin effect in the phase diagram just corresponds to a
{\it real-gap and point-gap coexisted topological phase}. Moreover, this phase
associated with the {\it symmetry-protected $\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin effect} is
experimentally observable by detecting the steady-state power spectral density.
Our work is of fundamental interest in enriching non-Bloch topological physics
by introducing quantum squeezing, and has potential applications for the
engineering of symmetry-protected sensors based on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ skin
effect.

The integration of two-dimensional $MoS_{2}$ with $GaN$ recently attracted
significant interest for future electronic/optoelectronic applications.
However, the reported studies have been mainly carried out using
heteroepitaxial $GaN$ templates on sapphire substrates, whereas the growth of
$MoS_{2}$ on low-dislocation-density bulk GaN can be strategic for the
realization of truly vertical devices. In this paper, we report the growth of
ultrathin $MoS_{2}$ films, mostly composed by single-layers ($1L$), onto
homoepitaxial $n-GaN$ on $n^{+}$ bulk substrates by sulfurization of a
pre-deposited $MoO_{x}$ film. Highly uniform and conformal coverage of the
$GaN$ surface was demonstrated by atomic force microscopy, while very low
tensile strain (0.05%) and a significant $p^{+}$-type doping ($4.5 \times
10^{12} cm^{-2}$) of $1L-MoS_{2}$ was evaluated by Raman mapping. Atomic
resolution structural and compositional analyses by aberration-corrected
electron microscopy revealed a nearly-ideal van der Waals interface between
$MoS_{2}$ and the $Ga$-terminated $GaN$ crystal, where only the topmost $Ga$
atoms are affected by oxidation. Furthermore, the relevant lattice parameters
of the $MoS_{2}/GaN$ heterojunction, such as the van der Waals gap, were
measured with high precision. Finally, the vertical current injection across
this 2D/3D heterojunction has been investigated by nanoscale current-voltage
analyses performed by conductive atomic force microscopy, showing a rectifying
behavior with an average turn-on voltage $V_{on}=1.7 V$ under forward bias,
consistent with the expected band alignment at the interface between $p^{+}$
doped $1L-MoS_{2}$ and $n-GaN$.

<br>
The concept of Wannier-Stark ladders, describing the equally spaced spectrum
of a tightly-bound particle in a constant electric field, is generalized to
account for arbitrary slowly-varying potentials. It is shown that an abrupt
transition exists that separates Wannier-Stark-like from effective-mass-like
behavior when the depth of the perturbation becomes equal to the width of the
band of extended states. For potentials bounded from below, the spectrum
bifurcates above the critical energy while the wavefunctions detach from the
effective-mass region and split into two pieces.

We address Coulomb drag and near-field heat transfer in a double-layer system
of incoherent metals. Each layer is modeled by an array of tunnel-coupled SYK
dots with random inter-layer interactions. Depending on the strength of
intra-dot interactions and inter-dot tunneling, this model captures the
crossover from the Fermi liquid to a strange metal phase. The absence of
quasiparticles in the strange metal leads to temperature-independent drag
resistivity, which is in strong contrast with the quadratic temperature
dependence in the Fermi liquid regime. We show that all the parameters can be
independently measured in near-field heat transfer experiments, performed in
Fermi liquid and strange metal regimes.

Van der Waals superlattices are important for tailoring the electronic
structures and properties of layered materials. Here we report the
superconducting properties and electronic structure of a natural van der Waals
superlattice (PbSe)$_{1.14}$NbSe$_2$. Anisotropic superconductivity with a
transition temperature $T_c$ = 5.6 $\pm$ 0.1 K, which is higher than monolayer
NbSe$_2$, is revealed by transport measurements on high-quality samples.
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal the
two-dimensional electronic structure and a charge transfer of 0.43 electrons
per NbSe$_2$ unit cell from the blocking PbSe layer. In addition,
polarization-dependent ARPES measurements reveal a significant circular
dichroism with opposite contrast at K and K' valleys, suggesting a significant
spin-orbital coupling and distinct orbital angular momentum. Our work suggests
natural van der Waals superlattice as an effective pathway for achieving
intriguing properties distinct from both the bulk and monolayer samples.

We demonstrate via exact diagonalization that AA stacked TMD homobilayers
host fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, zero-field analogs of their
finite-field cousins, at fractional fillings $n=\frac{1}{3},\, \frac{2}{3}$.
Additionally, ferromagnetism is present across a broad range of fillings where
the system is insulating or metallic alike. While both fractional quantum
anomalous hall states are robust at angles near $\theta\approx 2^{\circ}$, the
$n=\frac{1}{3}$ gives way to a charge density wave with increasing twist angle
whereas the $n=\frac{2}{3}$ state survives across a much broader range of twist
angles. We show that the competition between FQAH and charge density wave or
metallic phases is primarily controlled by Bloch band wavefunctions and
dispersion respectively.

<br>
<br>
We study a frustrated two-leg spin-1/2 ladder with alternate Ising and
isotropic Heisenberg rung exchange interactions, whereas, interactions along
legs and diagonals are Ising type. The ground-state (GS) of this model has four
exotic phases: (i) the stripe-rung ferromagnet (SRFM), (ii) the anisotropic
anti-ferromagnet (AAFM), (iii) the Dimer, and (iv) the stripe-leg ferromagnet
(SLFM) in absence of any external magnetic field. In this work, the effect of
externally applied longitudinal and transverse fields on quantum phases are
studied. In both cases, we show that there exist two plateau phases at $1/4$,
and $1/2$ of the saturation of magnetization. Due to the strong rung dimer
formation, the system opens a finite spin gap for all the phases resulting in
zero magnetization plateau in presence of a longitudinal field. The mechanism
of plateau formation is analyzed using spin density, quantum fidelity, and
quantum concurrence. In the (i) SRFM phase, Ising exchanges are dominant for
all spins but the Heisenberg rungs are weak, and therefore, the magnetization
shows a continuous transition as a function of transverse field. In the other
three phases [(ii)-(iv)], Ising dimer rungs are weak and broken first to reach
the plateau at $1/2$ of the saturation magnetization, having a large gap, which
is closed by further application of the field. We use the exact diagonalization
(ED) and the transfer matrix method (TM) to solve the Hamiltonian.

Electrical manipulation of antiferromagnetic states, a cornerstone of
antiferromagnetic spintronics, is a great challenge, requiring novel material
platforms. Here we report the full control over antiferromagnetic states by
voltage pulses in the insulating Co$_3$O$_4$ spinel. We show that the strong
linear magnetoelectric effect emerging in its antiferromagnetic state is fully
governed by the orientation of the N\'eel vector. As a unique feature of
Co$_3$O$_4$, the magnetoelectric energy can easily overcome the weak
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, thus, the N\'eel vector can be manipulated on
demand, either rotated smoothly or reversed suddenly, by combined electric and
magnetic fields. We succeed with switching between antiferromagnetic states of
opposite N\'eel vectors by voltage pulses within a few microsecond in
macroscopic volumes. These observations render quasi-cubic antiferromagnets,
like Co$_3$O$_4$, an ideal platform for the ultrafast (pico- to nanosecond)
manipulation of microscopic antiferromagnetic domains and may pave the way for
the realization of antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

Here we present a theoretical analysis (applicable to all twist angles of
TBG) of band dispersion and density of states in TBG relating evolution of flat
band and Van-Hove singularities with evolution of interlayer coupling in TBG. A
simple tight binding Hamiltonian with environment dependent interlayer hopping
and incorporated with internal configuration of carbon atoms inside a supercell
is used to calculate band dispersion and density of states in TBG. Various
Hamiltonian parameters and functional form of interlayer hopping applicable to
a wide range of twist angles in TBG is estimated by fitting calculated
dispersion and density of states with available experimentally observed
dispersion and density of states in Graphene, AB-stacked bilayer graphene and
some TBG systems. Computationally obtained band dispersion reveal that flat
band in TBG occurs very close to Dirac point of graphene and only along linear
dimension of two-dimensional wave vector space connecting two closest Dirac
points of two graphene layers of TBG.

<br>
<br>
The induced polarization oscillations in a one-dimensional rectangular
quantum well are modeled by a numerical solution of the time-dependent
Schroedinger equation. The finite-difference discretization over time is
realized in the framework of the Crank-Nicolson algorithm, whereas over the
spatial coordinate it is combined with the exterior complex-scaling technique.
A formation of the harmonic oscillations of the dipole moment by an incident
short unipolar pulse is shown. It is obtained that the frequency of
oscillations is solely defined by the energy of the main resonant transition.
Moreover, if two such short unipolar pulses are delayed by a half-period of the
oscillation, then these oscillations can be abruptly induced and stopped. Thus,
the so-called stopped polarization pulse is obtained. It is shown that both the
amplitude and the duration of the incident unipolar pulse, contributing to the
so-called electric pulse area, define the impact of the incident pulse on the
quantum system.

The free-energy difference $\Delta F$ between two high-dimensional systems is
an important yet computationally difficult quantity to compute. We demonstrate
that the microscopic fluctuation theorem for an unconventional definition of
work introduced by Vaikuntanathan and Jarzynski (2008) connects path ensembles
that are driven by protocols unequal under time-reversal, allowing us to use a
low-variance Bennett acceptance ratio $\Delta F$ estimator on bi-directional
measurements from time-asymmetric processes. It has been shown before that
counterdiabatic protocols give zero-variance work measurements for this
definition. Motivated by this, we propose an on-the-fly adaptive importance
sampling policy optimization algorithm that iteratively improves the efficiency
of the time-asymmetric protocols. This algorithm requires minimal computational
overhead, and uses all the samples collected in previous iterations to (1)
update the protocol, and (2) provide a $\Delta F$ estimate. We test our
algorithm on three models of varying complexity, finding that with just $10^3$
bi-directional work samples our algorithm yields $\Delta F$ estimates that are
$\sim 10^2 - 10^4$ times lower in mean squared error than the linear
interpolation protocol with which it was initialized.

Understanding the emergent electronic structure in twisted atomically thin
layers has led to the exciting field of twistronics. However, practical
applications of such systems are challenging since the specific angular
correlations between the layers must be precisely controlled and the layers
have to be single crystalline with uniform atomic ordering. Here, we suggest an
alternative, simple and scalable approach where nanocrystalline two-dimensional
(2D) film on three-dimensional (3D) substrates yield
twisted-interface-dependent properties. Ultrawide-bandgap hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) thin films are directly grown on high in-plane lattice
mismatched wide-bandgap silicon carbide (4H-SiC) substrates to explore the
twist-dependent structure-property correlations. Concurrently, nanocrystalline
h-BN thin film shows strong non-linear second-harmonic generation and ultra-low
cross-plane thermal conductivity at room temperature, which are attributed to
the twisted domain edges between van der Waals stacked nanocrystals with random
in-plane orientations. First-principles calculations based on time-dependent
density functional theory manifest strong even-order optical nonlinearity in
twisted h-BN layers. Our work unveils that directly deposited 2D
nanocrystalline thin film on 3D substrates could provide easily accessible
twist-interfaces, therefore enabling a simple and scalable approach to utilize
the 2D-twistronics integrated in 3D material devices for next-generation
nanotechnology.
