<h3>Current-driven motion of magnetic topological defects in ferromagnetic  superconductors</h3>

Recent years have seen a number of instances where magnetism and
superconductivity intrinsically coexist. Our focus is on the case where
spin-triplet superconductivity arises out of ferromagnetism, and we make a
hydrodynamic analysis of the effect of a charge supercurrent on magnetic
topological defects like domain walls and merons. We find that the emergent
electromagnetic field that arises out of the superconducting order parameter
provides a description for not only the physical quantities such as the local
energy flux density and the interaction between current and defects but also
the energy dissipation through magnetic dynamics of the Gilbert damping, which
becomes more prominent compared to the normal state as superconductivity
attenuates the energy dissipation through the charge sector. In particular, we
reveal that the current-induced dynamics of domain walls and merons in the
presence of the Gilbert damping give rise to the nonsingular $4\pi$ and $2\pi$
phase slips, respectively, revealing the intertwined dynamics of spin and
charge degrees of freedom in ferromagnetic superconductors.

<h3>Absence of cross-sublattice spin pumping and spin-transfer torques in  collinear antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13334" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13334</a>

<i>Junyu Tang, Ran Cheng</i>
<br>
<br>
There have been debates over the existence of cross-sublattice (CS)
contributions to spin pumping and spin-transfer torques in an antiferromagnet
(AFM) connected to a non-magnetic metal. By studying the interfacial spin
conductance from a symmetry perspective, we first relate the CS spin pumping to
the CS spin-transfer torques in a two-sublattice AFM. Then by calculating the
interfacial spin-dependent electron scattering microscopically, we ascertain
the exact absence of the controversial CS contributions in the collinear
regime. Even in the non-collinear regime, we find that the CS components only
constitute a higher-order correction to the known theory.

<h3>Bandwidth-tuned Wigner-Mott Transition at $Î½=1/5$: an Infinite Matrix  Product State Study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13355</a>

Electrons can organize themselves into charge-ordered states to minimize the
effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions. In the presence of a lattice,
commensurability constraints lead to the emergence of incompressible
Wigner-Mott (WM) insulators at various rational electron fillings, $\nu~=p/q$.
The mechanism for quantum fluctuation-mediated melting of the WM insulators
with increasing electron kinetic energy remains an outstanding problem. Here we
analyze numerically the bandwidth-tuned transition out of the WM insulator at
$\nu=1/5$ on infinite cylinders with varying circumference. For the two-leg
ladder, the transition from the WM insulator to the Luttinger liquid proceeds
via a distinct intermediate gapless phase -- the Luther-Emery liquid. We place
these results in the context of a low-energy bosonization based theory for the
transition. We also comment on the bandwidth-tuned transition(s) on the
five-leg cylinder, and connections to ongoing experiments in dual-gated bilayer
moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide materials.

<h3>Enhancement of Superconductivity in a Dirty Marginal Fermi Liquid</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13357" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13357</a>
<br>
<i>Tsz Chun Wu, Patrick A. Lee, Matthew S. Foster</i>
<br>
<br>
We study superconductivity in a two-dimensional, disordered marginal Fermi
liquid. At the semiclassical level, the transition temperature $T_c$ is
strongly suppressed because marginal Fermi liquid effects destroy well-defined
quasiparticles. However, we show that interference between quantum-critical
collective modes must be included, and these enhance $T_c$, violating
Anderson's theorem. Our results suggest that phase coherence in a disordered,
quantum-critical system can survive and manifest in the form of collective
excitations, despite the absence of coherent quasiparticles.

<h3>Tuning the phase diagram of a Rosenzweig-Porter model with fractal  disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13370" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13370</a>

Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model has garnered much attention in the last decade,
as it is a simple analytically tractable model showing both ergodic--nonergodic
extended and Anderson localization transitions. Thus, it is a good toy model to
understand the Hilbert-space structure of many body localization phenomenon. In
our study, we present analytical evidence, supported by exact numerical
computations, that demonstrates the controllable tuning of the phase diagram in
the RP model by employing on-site potentials with a non-trivial fractal
dimension instead of the conventional random disorder. We demonstrate that
doing so extends the fractal phase and creates unusual dependence of fractal
dimensions of the eigenfunctions. Furthermore, we study the fate of level
statistics in such a system and analyze the return probability of a wave packet
localized at a single site to provide a dynamical test-bed for our theory.

<h3>Non-equilibrium dynamics of bosons with dipole symmetry: A large $N$  Keldysh approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13372" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13372</a>
<br>
<i>Md Mursalin Islam, K. Sengupta, Rajdeep Sensarma</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the quench and the ramp dynamics of interacting $N$-component
charged bosons with dipole symmetry using Schwinger-Keldysh field theory in the
large $N$ limit. The equilibrium phase diagram of these bosons shows two phases
in the large $N$ limit. The first is a normal phase where both the global
$U(N)$ and the dipole symmetries are conserved and the second is a delocalized
condensed phase where both the symmetries are broken. In contrast, our explicit
computation of the steady state after an instantaneous quantum quench from the
condensed phase shows that an additional, novel, delocalized normal phase,
where the global $U(N)$ symmetry is conserved but the dipole symmetry is
broken, can exist for a range of quench parameters. A study of ramp dynamics of
the model shows that the above-mentioned steady state exists only above a
critical ramp rate which we estimate.

<h3>Stoner ferromagnetism in a momentum-confined interacting 2D electron gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13373" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13373</a>
<br>
<i>Ohad Antebi, Ady Stern, Erez Berg</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we investigate the ground state of a momentum-confined
interacting 2D electron gas, a momentum-space analog of an infinite quantum
well. The study is performed by combining analytical results with a numerical
exact diagonalization procedure. We find a ferromagnetic ground state near a
particular electron density and for a range of effective electron (or hole)
masses. We argue that this observation may be relevant to the generalized
Stoner ferromagnetism recently observed in multilayer graphene systems. The
collective magnon excitations exhibit a linear dispersion, which originates
from a diverging spin stiffness.

<h3>Quasi-Fermi liquid behavior in a one-dimensional system of interacting  spinless fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13374</a>
<br>
<i>Joshua D. Baktay, Alexander V. Rozhkov, Adrian E. Feiguin, Julian Rincon</i>
<br>
<br>
We present numerical evidence for a new paradigm in one-dimensional
interacting fermion systems, whose phenomenology has traits of both, Luttinger
liquids and Fermi liquids. This new state, dubbed a quasi-Fermi liquid,
possesses a discontinuity in its fermion occupation number at the Fermi
momentum. The excitation spectrum presents particle-like quasiparticles, and
absence of hole-like quasiparticles, giving rise instead to edge singularities.
Such a state is realized in a one-dimensional spinless fermion lattice
Hamiltonian by fine-tuning the interactions to a regime where they become
irrelevant in the renormalization group sense. We show, using uniform infinite
matrix products states and finite-entanglement scaling analysis, that the
system ground state is characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K = 1$ and a
discontinuous jump in the fermion occupation number. We support the
characterization with calculations of the spectral function, that show a
particle-hole asymmetry reflected in the existence of well-defined Landau
quasiparticles above the Fermi level, and edge singularities without the
associated quasiparticles below. These results indicate that the quasi-Fermi
liquid paradigm can be realized beyond the low-energy perturbative realm.

<h3>Acousto-magnonic Hall effect in honeycomb antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13375" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13375</a>
<br>
<i>Ryotaro Sano, Yuya Ominato, Mamoru Matsuo</i>
<br>
<br>
The recently discovered van der Waals antiferromagnets have suffered from the
lack of a comprehensive method to study their magnetic properties. Here, we
propose a dissipationless magnon spin Hall current driven by surface acoustic
waves as a novel probe for such antiferromagnets. Our results pave the way
towards mechanical detection and manipulation of the magnetic order in
two-dimensional antiferromagnets. Furthermore, they will overcome the
difficulties with weak magnetic responses inherent in the use of
antiferromagnets and hence provide a building block for future
antiferromagnetic spintronics.

<h3>Conformal Field Theories generated by Chern Insulators under Quantum  Decoherence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13410" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13410</a>
<br>
<i>Kaixiang Su, Nayan Myerson-Jain, Cenke Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
We demonstrate that the fidelity between a pure state trivial insulator and
the mixed state density matrix of a Chern insulator under decoherence can be
mapped to a variety of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT); more
specifically, the quantity $\mathcal{Z} = \text{tr}\{ \hat{\rho}^D_c
\hat{\rho}_\Omega \}$ is mapped to the partition function of the desired CFT,
where $\hat{\rho}^D_c$ and $\hat{\rho}_\Omega$ are respectively the density
matrices of the decohered Chern insulator and a pure state trivial insulator.
For a pure state Chern insulator with Chern number $2N$, the fidelity
$\mathcal{Z}$ is mapped to the partition function of the $\text{U}(2N)_1$ CFT;
under weak decoherence, the Chern insulator density matrix can experience
certain instability, and the "partition function" $\mathcal{Z}$ can flow to
other interacting CFTs with smaller central charges. The R\'{e}nyi relative
entropy $\mathcal{F} = - \log \text{tr}\{ \hat{\rho}^D_c \hat{\rho}_\Omega \}$
is mapped to the free energy of the CFT, and we demonstrate that the central
charge of the CFT can be extracted from the finite size scaling of
$\mathcal{F}$, analogous to the well-known finite size scaling of $2d$ CFT.

<h3>Dependence of topological phase on nuclear spin $S$ and spin modulation  vector in van der Waals Magnets</h3>

Recently non-chiral spin structures on the surface of the van der Waals (vdW)
magnets have been observed down to monolayers. We provide a Hamiltonian to
analyze the electronic properties of these materials. The Hamiltonian takes
into account the arbitrary background spin structures and large atomic spin $S$
of the materials. The large spin-\emph{S} treatment is necessary as magnetic
atoms of the vdW magnets can have spin $S > 1/2$. In this work the Hamiltonian
is solved for the spin spirals with azimuthal and polar degrees of freedom --
this spin structure was recently observed in Fe$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. We
methodically analyze the Hamiltonian for both integer and half-integer spins in
the honeycomb lattice. It shows emerging topological hall effect emerges
irrespective of the spin. The Chern number, hence the topological phase,
depends on the spin \emph{S}, and interestingly only on the azimuthal angle of
the spin vector. These results will be useful for the design of the topological
electronics devices based on vdW magnets.

<h3>Efficient numerical description of the dynamics of interacting  multispecies quantum gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13433" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13433</a>
<br>
<i>Annie Pichery, Matthias Meister, Baptist Piest, Jonas BÃ¶hm, Ernst Maria Rasel, Eric Charron, Naceur Gaaloul</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a highly efficient method for the numerical solution of coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations describing the evolution dynamics of a multispecies
mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates in time-dependent potentials. This method,
based on a grid-scaling technique, compares favorably to a more standard but
much more computationally expensive solution based on a frozen-resolution grid.
It allows an accurate description of the long-time behavior of interacting,
multi-species quantum mixtures including the challenging problem of long free
expansions relevant for microgravity and space experiments. We demonstrate a
successful comparison to experimental measurements of a binary Rb-K mixture
recently performed with the payload of a sounding rocket experiment.

<h3>Anomalous tumbling of colloidal ellipsoids in Poiseuille flows</h3>

<br>

Shear flows cause aspherical colloidal particles to tumble so that their
orientations trace out complex trajectories known as Jeffery orbits. The
Jeffery orbit of a prolate ellipsoid is predicted to align the particle's
principal axis preferentially in the plane transverse to the axis of shear.
Holographic microscopy measurements reveal instead that colloidal ellipsoids'
trajectories in Poiseuille flows strongly favor an orientation inclined by
roughly $\pi/8$ relative to this plane. This anomalous observation is
consistent with at least two previous reports of colloidal rods and dimers of
colloidal spheres in Poiseuille flow and therefore appears to be a generic, yet
unexplained feature of colloidal transport at low Reynolds numbers.

<h3>Quantum state manipulation and science of ultracold molecules</h3>

An increasingly large variety of molecular species are being cooled down to
low energies in recent years, and innovative ideas and powerful techniques
continue to emerge to gain ever more precise control of molecular motion. In
this brief review we focus our discussions on two widely employed cooling
techniques that have brought molecular gases into the quantum regime:
association of ultracold atomic gases into quantum gases of molecules and
direct laser cooling of molecules. These advances have brought into reality our
capability to prepare and manipulate both internal and external states of
molecules quantum mechanically, opening the field of cold molecules to a wide
range of scientific explorations.

<h3>Largest eigenvalue statistics of sparse random adjacency matrices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13465" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13465</a>
<br>
<i>Bogdan Slavov, Kirill Polovnikov, Sergei Nechaev, Nikita Pospelov</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the statistics of the largest eigenvalue, $\lambda_{\rm max}$,
in an ensemble of $N\times N$ large ($N\gg 1$) sparse adjacency matrices,
$A_N$. The most attention is paid to the distribution and typical fluctuations
of $\lambda_{\rm max}$ in the vicinity of the percolation threshold,
$p_c=\frac{1}{N}$. The overwhelming majority of subgraphs representing $A_N$
near $p_c$ are exponentially distributed linear subchains, for which the
statistics of the normalized largest eigenvalue can be analytically connected
with the Gumbel distribution. For the ensemble of {\rm all} subgraphs near
$p_c$ we suggest that under an appropriate modification of the normalization
constant the Gumbel distribution provides a reasonably good approximation.
Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed transformation of
$\lambda_{\rm max}$ is indeed Gumbel-distributed and the leading finite-size
corrections in the vicinity of $p_c$ scale with $N$ as $\sim \ln^{-2}N$. All
together, our results reveal a previously unknown universality in eigenvalue
statistics of sparse matrices close to the percolation threshold.

<h3>Dynamically altered conductance in an Organic Thin Film Memristive  Device</h3>

<br>
<br>
The memristive device is one of the basic elements of novel, brain-inspired,
fast, and energy-efficient information processing systems in which there is no
separation between memorization and information analysis functions. Since the
first demonstration of the resistive switching effect, several types of
memristive devices have been developed. In most of them, the memristive effect
originates from direct modification of the conducting area, e.g. conducting
filament formation/disintegration, or semiconductor doping/dedoping. Here, we
report a solution-processed lateral memristive device based on a new
conductivity modulation mechanism. The device architecture resembles that of an
organic field-effect transistor in which the top gate electrode is replaced
with an additional insulator layer containing mobile ions. Alteration of the
ion distribution under the influence of applied potential changes the electric
field, modifying the conductivity of the semiconductor channel. The devices
exhibit highly stable current-voltage hysteresis loops and Short-Term
Plasticity (STP). We also demonstrate short-term synaptic plasticity with
tunable time constants.

Large swarms of extremely simple robots (i.e., capable just of basic motion
activities, like propelling forward or self-rotating) are widely applied to
study collective task performance based on self-organization or local
algorithms instead of sophisticated programming and global swarm coordination.
Moreover, they represent a versatile yet affordable platform for experimental
studies in physics, particularly in active matter - non-equilibrium assemblies
of particles converting their energy to a directed motion. However, a large set
of robotics platforms is being used in different studies, while the universal
design is still lacking. Despite such platforms possess advantages in certain
application scenarios, their large number sufficiently limits further
development of results in the field, as advancing some study requires to buy or
manually produce the corresponding robots. To address this issue, we develop an
open-source Swarmodroid 1.0 platform based on bristle-bots with reconfigurable
3D-printed bodies, external control of motion velocity, and basic capabilities
of velocity profile programming. In addition, we introduce AMPy software
package in Python featuring OpenCV-based extraction of robotic swarm kinematics
accompanied by the evaluation of key physical quantities describing the
collective dynamics. We perform a detailed analysis of individual Swarmodroids'
motion characteristics and address their use cases with two examples: a cargo
transport performed by self-rotating robots and a velocity-dependent jam
formation in a bottleneck by self-propelling robots. Finally, we provide a
comparison of existing centimeter-scale robotic platforms, a review of key
quantities describing collective dynamics of many-particle systems, and a
comprehensive outlook considering potential applications as well as further
directions for fundamental studies and Swarmodroid 1.0 platform development.

<h3>On the relation between thermodynamical and statistical entropy: The  origin of the N!</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13513" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13513</a>
<br>
<i>Sergio Di Matteo</i>
<br>
<br>
The division by N! in the expression of statistical entropy is usually
justified to students by the statement that classical particles should be
counted as indistinguishable. Sometimes, quantum indistinguishability is
invoked to explain it. In this paper, we try to clarify the issue starting from
Clausius thermodynamical entropy and deriving from it Boltzmann statistical
entropy for the ideal gas. This approach appears interesting for two reasons:
Firstly, it provides a direct heuristic link between thermodynamical and
statistical expressions of entropy that is missing in the usual approach. In
second place, it explicitly reminds that also statistical entropy is defined
with respect to a reference state, chosen to be the quantum-mechanical (T=0)
ground state of the N-particles in a box. Both factors $h^{3N}$ and $N!$ at the
denominator of the statistical entropy are a consequence of the quantum nature
of the reference state: in particular, the $N!$ is not related to the particle
identity, but to the identity of the boundary conditions on the
quantum-mechanical ground-state momenta, and to a general statistical
maximization principle. The introduction of a reference state also allows to
reinterpret the standard case of two mixing gases.

<h3>Interaction and collision of skyrmions in chiral antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13515" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13515</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Skyrmions in an antiferromagnet can travel as solitary waves in stark
contrast to the situation in ferromagnets. Traveling skyrmion solutions have
been found numerically in chiral antiferromagnets. We consider head-on
collision events between two skyrmions. We find that the result of the
collision depends on the initial velocity of the skyrmions. For small
velocities, the skyrmions are shrinking as they are approaching, they bounce
back and eventually acquire almost their initial speed. For larger velocities,
the skyrmions approach each other and shrink until they become singular points
and are eventually annihilated. We describe the observed phenomena in terms of
skyrmion energetics and thus determine the regimes of the different dynamical
behaviors.

<h3>Superlattice Engineering of Topology in Massive Dirac Fermions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13522" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13522</a>
<br>
<i>Nishchay Suri, Chong Wang, Benjamin M. Hunt, Di Xiao</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that a superlattice potential can be employed to engineer topology in
massive Dirac fermions in systems such as bilayer graphene, moir\'e
graphene-boron nitride, and transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers
and bilayers. We use symmetry analysis to analyze band inversions to determine
the Chern number $\mathscr C$ for the valence band as a function of tunable
potential parameters for a class of $C_4$ and $C_3$ symmetric potentials. We
present a novel method to engineer Chern number $\mathscr{C}=2$ for the valence
band and show that the applied potential at minimum must have a scalar together
with a non-scalar periodic part. We discover that certain forms of the
superlattice potential, which may be difficult to realize in naturally
occurring moir\'e patterns, allow for the possibility of non-trivial
topological transitions. These forms may be achievable using an external
superlattice potential that can be created using contemporary experimental
techniques. Our work paves the way to realize the quantum Spin Hall effect
(QSHE), quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), and even exotic non-Abelian
anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE).

Rapidly increasing interest in low-dimensional materials is driven by the
emerging requirement to develop nanoscale
solid-state devices with novel functional properties that are not available
in three-dimensional bulk phases.
Among the well-known low-dimensional systems, complex transition metal oxide
interface holds promise for broad
applications in electronic and spintronics devices. Herein, intriguing
metal-insulator and
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transitions are achieved in monolayer MnO$_2$
that is sandwiched into
SrTiO$_3$-based heterointerface systems through interface engineering.
By using first-principles calculations, we modeled three types of
SrTiO$_3$-based heterointerface systems with different interface terminations
and performed a comparative study on the spin-dependent magnetic and electronic
properties that are established in the confined MnO$_2$ monolayer.
First-principles study predicts that metal-insulator transition and magnetic
transition in the monolayer MnO$_2$ are independent on the thickness of capping
layers. Moreover, 100$\%$ spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases
accompanied by robust room temperature magnetism are uncovered in the monolayer
MnO$_2$. Not only is the buried MnO$_2$ monolayer a new interface phase of
fundamental physical interest, but it is also a promising candidate material
for nanoscale spintronics applications. Our study suggests interface
engineering at complex oxide interfaces is an alternative approach to designing
high-performance two-dimensional materials.

<h3>Spin loop-current textures in the Hubbard models</h3>

The recent experimental observations of loop current in Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$,
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$, and Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ have inspired a
theoretical study that broadly redefines loop current as a manifestation of
quantum liquid crystals. Using the density-matrix renormalization group method,
here we investigate the emergence of spin loop-current (sLC) textures in
carrier-doped (i) excitonic insulators, (ii) orbital-selective Mott insulators,
and (iii) two-dimensional Mott insulators, modeled by a two-orbital Hubbard
model on a ladder lattice in (i) and (ii) and a single-orbital Hubbard model on
a square lattice in (iii). Calculating the spatial distribution of spin current
around a bond to which a pinning field is applied, we find conditions for
longer-ranged sLC correlations. In system (i), using typical sets of model
parameters for Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3}$, we find that a sLC texture
appears near half filling, associated with an excitonic condensation in a spin
channel. In system (ii), using typical sets of model parameters for
BaFe$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, we find that a sLC texture appears at electron fillings
where a block-type antiferromagnetism develops. In system (iii), introducing a
next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'\sim -0.25$ (in unit of the nearest neighbor
hopping) suggested for high-$T_\text{c}$ cuprates, we find that an axial-sLC
texture emerges at hole-carrier density $\delta=0.125$, where the charge stripe
simultaneously appears.

In this work, we study the effects of a transverse magnetic field in a Kondo
lattice model with two $f$ orbitals interacting with the conduction electrons.
The $f$ electrons that are present on the same site interact through Hund's
coupling, while on neighboring sites they interact through intersite exchange.
We consider here that part of $f$ electrons are localized (orbital 1) while
another part (orbital 2) are delocalized, as it is frequent in uranium systems.
Then, only electrons in the localized orbital 1 interact through exchange
interaction with the neighboring ones, while electrons in orbital 2 are coupled
with conduction electrons through a Kondo interaction. We obtain a solution
where ferromagnetism and Kondo effect coexist for small values of an applied
transverse magnetic field for $T\rightarrow0$. Increasing the transverse field,
two situations can be obtained when Kondo coupling vanishes: first, a
metamagnetic transition occurs just before or at the same time of the fully
polarized state, and second, a metamagnetic transition occurs when the spins
are already pointing out along the magnetic field.

We propose a solution to the puzzle of dimensional reduction in the random
field Ising model by studying the equivalent binary fluid in a random medium,
and inverting the question by asking: to what random problem in $D\!=\!d+2$
dimensions does a pure system in $d$ dimensions correspond? For a model with
purely repulsive interactions of finite range, we show that the mean density
and other observables are equal to those of a similar model in $D$ dimensions,
but with interactions and correlated disorder in the extra two dimensions of
range $\propto\lambda$, in the limit as $\lambda\to\infty$. There is no
conflict with rigorous results that the finite range model with locally
correlated disorder orders in $D=3$. Our argument avoids the use of replicas
and perturbative field theory, instead being based on convergent cluster
expansions. Although the result may be seen as a consequence of Parisi-Sourlas
supersymmetry, it follows more directly from Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem.

Owing to the chirality of Weyl nodes characterized by the first Chern number,
a Weyl system supports one-way chiral zero modes under a magnetic field, which
underlies the celebrated chiral anomaly. As a generalization of Weyl nodes from
three-dimensional to five-dimensional physical systems, Yang monopoles are
topological singularities carrying nonzero second-order Chern numbers c2 = +1
or -1. Here, we couple a Yang monopole with an external gauge field using an
inhomogeneous Yang monopole metamaterial, and experimentally demonstrate the
existence of a gapless chiral zero mode, where the judiciously designed
metallic helical structures and the corresponding effective antisymmetric
bianisotropic terms provide the means for controlling gauge fields in a
synthetic five-dimensional space. This zeroth mode is found to originate from
the coupling between the second Chern singularity and a generalized 4-form
gauge field - the wedge product of the magnetic field with itself. This
generalization reveals intrinsic connections between physical systems of
different dimensions, while a higher dimensional system exhibits much richer
supersymmetric structures in Landau level degeneracy due to the internal
degrees of freedom. Our study offers the possibility of controlling
electromagnetic waves by leveraging the concept of higher-order and
higher-dimensional topological phenomena.

Dense suspensions of fine particles are significant in numerous biological,
industrial, and natural phenomena. They also provide an ideal tool to develop
statistical mechanics description for out-of-equilibrium systems. Predicting
the bulk response of such materials has been challenging since these systems
often undergo liquid-solid transitions upon a small change in solid
concentration or applied loading. Developing an understanding of the mechanisms
that drive these phenomena has over the last several years led to a surge in
research activity at the intersection of fluid mechanics, granular materials,
driven disordered systems, tribology, and soft condensed matter physics. One
central aspect that emerged is that these phenomena are due to a
shear-activated or deactivated network of contacts between particles. The
perspective briefly presents the current state of understanding and challenges
associated with relating the flow of material at the bulk scale with the
microscopic physics at the particle scale.

We report the laminar and quasi-turbulent dynamic behaviors of magnetic
skyrmions flowing in a pipe channel. The skyrmion flow driven by a uniform
current may show a lattice structural transition. The skyrmion flow driven by a
non-uniform current shows a dynamically varying lattice structure. A large
uniform current could result in the compression of skyrmions toward the channel
edge, leading to the transition of the skyrmion pipe flow into an open-channel
flow with a free surface. Skyrmions on the free surface may form a single shear
layer adjacent to the main skyrmion flow. Our results reveal the fluid nature
of skyrmionic quasiparticles that may play an essential role in applications.

<h3>From Ergodicity to Many-Body Localization in a One-Dimensional  Interacting Non-Hermitian Stark System</h3>

<br>
<br>
Recent studies on disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL) in
non-Hermitian quantum systems have attracted great interest. However, the
non-Hermitian disorder-free MBL still needs to be clarified. We consider a
one-dimensional interacting Stark model with nonreciprocal hoppings having
time-reversal symmetry, the properties of which are boundary dependent. Under
periodic boundary conditions (PBC), such a model exhibits three types of phase
transitions: the real-complex transition of eigenenergies, the topological
phase transition, and the non-Hermitian Stark MBL transition. The real-complex
and topological phase transitions occur at the same point in the thermodynamic
limit, but do not coincide with the non-Hermitian Stark MBL transition, which
is quite different from the non-Hermitian disordered cases. By the level
statistics, the system undergoes from the Ginibre ensemble (GE) to Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble (GOE) to Possion ensemble (PE) transitions with the
increase of the linear tilt potential's strength $\gamma$. The real-complex
transition of the eigenvalues is accompanied by the GE-to-GOE transition in the
ergodic regime. Moreover, the second transition of the level statistics
corresponds to the occurrence of non-Hermitian Stark MBL. We demonstrate that
the non-Hermitian Stark MBL is robust and shares many similarities with
disorder-induced MBL, which several existing characteristic quantities of the
spectral statistics and eigenstate properties can confirm. The dynamical
evolutions of the entanglement entropy and the density imbalance can
distinguish the real-complex and Stark MBL transitions. Finally, we find that
our system under open boundary conditions lacks a real-complex transition, and
the transition of non-Hermitian Stark MBL is the same as that under PBCs.

<br>
<br>
The valley-related multiple topological phase transitions attracted
significant attention due to their providing significant opportunities for
fundamental research and practical applications. However, unfortunately, to
date there is no real material that can realize valley-related multiple
topological phase transitions. Here, through first-principles calculations and
model analysis, we investigate the structural, magnetic, electronic, and
topological properties of VSiXN$_4$ (X = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) monolayers.
VSiXN$_4$ monolayers are stable and intrinsically ferrovalley materials.
Intriguingly, we found that the built-in electric field and strain can induce
valley-related multiple topological phase transitions in the materials from
valley semiconductor to valley-half-semimetal, to valley quantum anomalous Hall
insulator, to valley-half-semimetal, and to valley semiconductor (or to
valley-metal). The nature of topological phase transition is the built-in
electric field and strain induce band inversion between the
d$_{xy}$/d$_{x2-y2}$ and d$_{z2}$ at obritals at K and K' valleys. Our findings
not only reveal the mechanism of multiple topological phase transitions, but
also provides an ideal platform for the multi-field manipulating the spin,
valley, and topological physics. It will open new perspectives for spintronic,
valleytronic, and topological nanoelectronic applications based on these
materials.

<br>
<br>
The organic spacer cation plays a crucial role in determining the exciton
fine structure in two-dimensional (2D) perovskites. Here, we use
low-temperature magneto-optical spectroscopy to gain insight into the influence
of the organic spacer on dark excitons in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites.
We show that by using modest magnetic field strengths (<1.5 T), the
spin-forbidden dark exciton state can be identified and its emission properties
significantly modulated through the application of in-plane magnetic fields, up
to temperatures of 15 K. At low temperatures, an increase in collected
photoluminescence efficiency of >30% is demonstrated, signifying the critical
role of the dark exciton state for light-emitting applications of 2D
perovskites. The exciton fine structure and the degree of
magnetic-field-induced mixing are impacted by the choice of organic spacer
cation, with 4-methoxyphenethylammonium (MeO-PEA) showing the largest effect
due to larger bright-dark exciton splitting. Our results suggest that dark
excitons preferentially form biexcitons depending on the choice of spacer. We
distinguish between interior (bulk) and surface dark-exciton emission, showing
that bright-dark exciton splitting differs between the interior and surface.
Our results emphasize the significance of the organic spacer cation in
controlling the exciton fine structure in 2D perovskites and have important
implications for the development of optoelectronic technology based on 2D
perovskites.

<br>
<br>
Since dissipative processes are ubiquitous in semiconductors, characterizing
how electronic and thermal energy transduce and transport at the nanoscale is
vital for understanding and leveraging their fundamental properties. For
example, in low-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), excess
heat generation upon photoexcitation is difficult to avoid since even with
modest injected exciton densities, exciton-exciton annihilation still occurs.
Both heat and photoexcited electronic species imprint transient changes in the
optical response of a semiconductor, yet the unique signatures of each are
difficult to disentangle in typical spectra due to overlapping resonances. In
response, we employ stroboscopic optical scattering microscopy (stroboSCAT) to
simultaneously map both heat and exciton populations in few-layer \ch{MoS2} on
relevant nanometer and picosecond length- and time scales and with 100-mK
temperature sensitivity. We discern excitonic contributions to the signal from
heat by combining observations close to and far from exciton resonances,
characterizing photoinduced dynamics for each. Our approach is general and can
be applied to any electronic material, including thermoelectrics, where heat
and electronic observables spatially interplay, and lays the groundwork for
direct and quantitative discernment of different types of coexisting energy
without recourse to complex models or underlying assumptions.

Defect centers in wide-band-gap crystals attracted considerable attention due
to the realisations of qubits, sensors, or single photon emitters at room
temperature. The family of these centers is constantly growing, including
well-known examples such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond,
silicon-vacancy in silicon carbide, chromium substitutions in aluminium oxide,
and many others. Unfortunately, such defect centers embedded in highly
insulating crystals have been notoriously difficult to excite electrically.
Herewith, we present a realisation of insulating light-emitting diodes based on
carbon centers in hexagonal boron nitride. The rational design of the vertical
tunnelling devices via van der Waals technology enabled us to control the
charge dynamics related to non-radiative tunelling, defect-to-band
electroluminescence, and intradefect electroluminescence. The fundamental
understanding of the tunnelling events enabled us to achieve high efficiency of
electrical excitation, which exceeded by a few orders of magnitude the
efficiency of optical excitation in the sub-band-gap regime. A combination of a
Stark effect and screening by band electrons provide a control knob for tuning
the energy of emission. With this work, we solve an outstanding problem of
creating electrically driven devices realised with defect centers in
wide-band-gap crystals, which are relevant in the domain of optoelectronics,
telecommunication, computation, or sensing.

Halide pervoskites are an important class of semiconducting materials which
hold great promise for optoelectronic applications. In this work we investigate
the relationship between vibrational anharmonicity and dynamic disorder in this
class of solids. Via a multi-scale model parameterized from first-principles
calculations, we demonstrate that the non-Gaussian lattice motion in halide
perovskites is microscopically connected to the dynamic disorder of overlap
fluctuations among electronic states. This connection allows us to rationalize
the emergent differences in temperature-dependent mobilities of prototypical
MAPbI$_3$ and MAPbBr$_3$ compounds across structural phase-transitions, in
agreement with experimental findings. Our analysis suggests that the details of
vibrational anharmonicity and dynamic disorder can complement known predictors
of electronic conductivity and can provide structure-property guidelines for
the tuning of carrier transport characteristics in anharmonic semiconductors.

Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) has been extensively studied over
the past two decades. While current-induced spin polarization in chiral
molecules is widely recognized as the fundamental principle of the CISS, only a
few studies have been reported on bias-current-free CISS, where there is no
bias electric current in chiral molecules. In this paper, we discuss the
microscopic origin of bias-free CISS using chiral molecule/ferromagnet bilayer
systems. Recent studies on the chirality-induced exchange bias and
current-in-plane magnetoresistance (CIP-MR) effects indicate that chiral
molecules possess thermally driven broken-time-reversal symmetry at the
interface, which induces bias-current-free CISS, i.e. a spontaneous effective
magnetic field in the system. We also discuss the possibility of the linear
magnetoelectric effect of chiral molecules at the interface and its potential
impact on the observed CISS phenomena.

Stochastic resetting is a rapidly developing topic in the field of stochastic
processes and their applications. It denotes the occasional reset of a
diffusing particle to its starting point and effects, inter alia, optimal
first-passage times to a target. Recently the concept of partial resetting, in
which the particle is reset to a given fraction of the current value of the
process, has been established and the associated search behaviour analysed.
Here we go one step further and we develop a general technique to determine the
time-dependent probability density function (PDF) for Markov processes with
partial resetting. We obtain an exact representation of the PDF in the case of
general symmetric L\'evy flights with stable index $0<\alpha\le2$. For Cauchy
and Brownian motions (i.e., $\alpha=1,2$), this PDF can be expressed in terms
of elementary functions in position space. We also determine the stationary
PDF. Our numerical analysis of the PDF demonstrates intricate crossover
behaviours as function of time.

We have investigated structural, electronic and magnetic properties of
H$_2$Pc on Fe$_2$N/Fe using low-energy electron diffraction and soft x-ray
absorption spectroscopy/x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. Element specific
magnetization curves reveal that the magnetic coupling with H$_2$Pc enhances
the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of Fe$_2$N/Fe at the H$_2$Pc coverage of
1 molecular layer. However, adding two and three molecular layers of H$_2$Pc
reverts the shape of magnetization curve back to the initial state before
H$_2$Pc deposition. We successfully link appearance and disappearance of the
magnetic coupling at the H$_2$Pc-Fe$_2$N/Fe interface with the change of
hybridization strength at N sites accompanied by the increase in the H$_2$Pc
coverage.

Exploring the interplay between topological phases and photons opens new
avenues for investigating novel quantum states. Here we show that
superconducting resonators can serve as sensitive probes for properties of
topological insulator nanowires (TINWs) embedded within them. By combining a
static, controllable magnetic flux threading the TINW with an additional
oscillating electromagnetic field applied perpendicularly, we show that orbital
resonances can be generated and are reflected in periodic changes of the
Q-factor of the resonator as a function of the flux. This response probes the
confinement of the two-dimensional Dirac orbitals on the surface of the TINW,
revealing their density of states and specific transition rules, as well as
their dependence on the applied flux. Our approach represents a promising
cross-disciplinary strategy for probing topological solid-state materials using
state-of-the-art photonic cavities, which would avoid the need for attaching
contacts, thereby enabling access to electronic properties closer to the
pristine topological states.

The investigation of chemical reactions during the ion irradiation is a
frontier for the study of the ion-material interaction. In order to derive the
contribution of bond formation to chemistry of ion produced nanoclusters, the
valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELS) was exploited to investigate
the Ga$^+$ ion damage in Al$_2$O$_3$, InP and InGaAs, where each target
material has been shown to yield different process for altering the clustering
of recoil atoms: metallic Ga, metallic In and InGaP clusters in Al$_2$O$_3$,
InP and InGaAs respectively. Supporting simulations based on Monte Carlo and
crystal orbital Hamiltonianindicate that the chemical constitution of cascade
induced nano-precipitates is a result of a competition between
interstitial/vacancy consumption rate and preferential bond formation.

Criticality is an emergent phenomenon observed during second-order phase
transitions. The brain is increasingly seen as a complex system that operates
near criticality, where complex systems exhibit high correlations. When
approaching criticality, a system shows `domain'-like regions with competing
phases and increased spatiotemporal correlations that tend to diverge. The
dynamics of these domains depend on the system's proximity to criticality. By
mapping fMRI signals from the brain to a spin-lattice model, we can study
brain's critical behavior. However, the extent to which the normal and
Alzheimer's brain exhibit distinct critical ordering based on their proximity
to criticality remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the domain
properties of the spin-lattice model derived from the Alzheimer's and
cognitively normal subjects.

The two-dimensional 1T-CrTe$_2$ has been an attractive room-temperature van
der Waals magnet which has a potential application in spintronic devices.
Although it was recognized as a ferromagnetism in the past, the monolayer
1T-CrTe$_2$ was recently found to exhibit zigzag antiferromagnetism with the
easy axis oriented at $70^\circ$ to the perpendicular direction of the plane.
Therefore, the origin of the intricate anisotropic magnetic behavior therein is
well worthy of thorough exploration. Here, by applying density functional
theory with spin spiral method, we demonstrate that the Kitaev interaction,
together with the single-ion anisotropy and other off-diagonal exchanges, is
amenable to explain the magnetic orientation in the metallic 1T-CrTe$_2$.
Moreover, the Ruderman-Kittle-Kasuya-Yosida interaction can also be extracted
from the dispersion calculations, which explains the metallic behavior of
1T-CrTe$_2$. Our results demonstrate that 1T-CrTe$_2$ is potentially a rare
metallic Kitaev material.

We analyze the origin of the parabolic background of magnetoresistance
oscillations measured in finite-width superconducting mesoscopic rings with
input and output stubs and in patterned films. The transmission model
explaining the sinusoidal oscillation of magnetoresistance is extended to
address the parabolic background as a function of the magnetic field. Apart
from the interference mechanism activated by the ring, pinned superconducting
vortices as topological defects introduce a further interference-based
distribution of supercurrents that affects, in turn, the voltmeter-sensed
quasiparticles. The onset of vortices changes the topology of the
superconducting state in a mesoscopic ring in a such a way that the full
magnetoresistance dynamics can be interpreted owing to the interference of the
constituents of the order parameter induced by both the ring with its
doubly-connected topology and the vortex lattice in it.

We theoretically consider the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect (IREE) induced
by spin pumping from a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) into a two-dimensional

coexist. We clarify that the magnetization and current in the 2DEG generated by
the IREE depend on the resonant frequency of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)
and azimuth angle of the spontaneous spin polarization of the FI. We further
show that the magnetization and current increase substantially as the ratio of
magnitudes of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions approaches unity.

altering the carrier concentration with back gate voltage, we transfer the wire
through several transport regimes: from residual Coulomb blockade to nonlinear
resonance regime, followed by linear resonance regime and, finally, to almost

measured with scanning gate microscopy and spectra of universal conductance
fluctuations. A clear sign of fractal behavior of magnetoconductance dependence
is observed for non-linear and linear resonance transport regimes.

We present a method to constrain local charge multipoles within

charge distribution around atomic sites and can indicate potential hidden
orders. Our method allows selective control of specific multipoles,
facilitating a quantitative exploration of the energetic landscape outside of
local minima. Thus, it enables a clear distinction between electronically and
structurally driven instabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method by applying it to charge quadrupoles in the prototypical orbitally
ordered material KCuF$_3$. We quantify intersite multipole-multipole
interactions as well as the energy-lowering related to the formation of an
isolated local quadrupole. We also map out the energy as a function of the size
of the local quadrupole moment around its local minimum, enabling
quantification of multipole fluctuations around their equilibrium value.
Finally, we study charge quadrupoles in the solid solution
KCu$_{1-x}$Zn$_x$F$_3$ to characterize the behavior across the
tetragonal-to-cubic transition. Our method provides a powerful tool for
studying symmetry breaking in materials with coupled electronic and structural
instabilities and potentially hidden orders.

Chemotaxis, i.e. motion generated by chemical gradients, is a motility mode
shared by many living species that has been developed by evolution to optimize
certain biological processes such as foraging or immune response. In
particular, auto-chemotaxis refers to chemotaxis mediated by a cue produced by
the chemotactic particle itself. Here, we investigate the collective behavior
of auto-chemotactic particles that are repelled by the cue and therefore
migrate preferentially towards low-concentration regions. To this end, we
introduce a lattice model inspired by the true self-avoiding walk which reduces
to the Keller-Segels model in the continuous limit, for which we describe the
rich phase behavior. We first rationalize a the chemically-mediated alignment
interaction between walkers in the limit of stationary concentration fields,
and then describe the various large-scale structures that can spontaneously
form and the conditions for them to emerge, among which we find stable bands
traveling at constant speed in the direction transverse to the band.

The site percolation on the triangular lattice is one of few exactly solved
statistical systems. Starting from critical percolation clusters of black or
white sites that are randomly placed, we randomly reassign the color of each
percolation cluster and obtain coarse-grained configurations by merging
clusters of the same color. It is shown that this process can be infinitely
iterated in the thermodynamic limit, leading to an iterative percolation model.
Further, we conjecture from self-matching argument that percolation clusters
remain fractal for any finite generation, which can even take any real number
by a generalized process. Extensive simulations are performed, and, from the
generation-dependent fractal dimension, a continuous family of previously
unknown universalities is revealed. Finally, following a similar process, the
iterative percolation is defined for critical bond-percolation clusters.

Dense suspensions often exhibit a dramatic response to large external
deformation. The recent body of work has related this behavior to transition
from an unconstrained lubricated to a constrained frictional state. Here, we
use numerical simulations to study the flow behavior and shear-induced
diffusion of frictional non-Brownian spheres in two dimensions under simple
shear flow. We first show that both viscosity $\eta$ and diffusivity
$D/\dot{\gamma}$ of the particles increase at characteristic shear stress,
which is associated with lubrication to frictional transition. Subsequently, we
propose a one-to-one relation between viscosity and diffusivity using the
length scale $\xi$ associated with the size of collective motions (rigid
clusters) of the particles. We demonstrate that $\eta$ and $D/\dot{\gamma}$ are
controlled by $\xi$ in two distinct flow regimes, i.e. in the frictionless and
frictional states, where the one-to-one relation is described as a crossover
from $D/\dot{\gamma}\sim\eta$ ({frictionless}) to $\eta^{1/3}$ ({frictional}).
We also confirm the proposed power laws are insensitive to the interparticle
friction and system size.

<br>
<br>
This paper focuses on investigating high-order harmonic generation (HHG) in
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under intense near-infrared laser fields. To model
the GQD and its interaction with the laser field, we utilize a mean-field
approach. Our analysis of the HHG power spectrum reveals fine structures and a
noticeable enhancement in cutoff harmonics due to the long-range correlations.
We also demonstrate the essential role of Coulomb interaction in determining of
harmonics intensities and cutoff position. Unlike atomic HHG, where the cutoff
energy is proportional to the pump wave intensity, in GQDs the cutoff energy
scales with the square root of the field strength amplitude. A detailed
time-frequency analysis of the entire range of HHG spectrum is presented using
a wavelet transform. The analysis reveals intricate details of the spectral and
temporal fine structures of HHG, offering insights into the various HHG
mechanisms in GQDs.

In the context of quantum gases, we obtain a many-body Hamiltonian for
spin-3/2 atoms with general multipole (spin, quadrupole, and octupole) exchange
interaction by employing the apparatus of irreducible spherical tensor
operators. This Hamiltonian implies the finite-range interaction, whereas, for
zero-range (contact) potentials parameterized by the $s$-wave scattering
length, the multipole exchange interaction becomes irrelevant. Following the
reduced description method for quantum systems, we derive the quantum kinetic
equation for spin-3/2 atoms in a magnetic field and apply it to examine the
high-frequency oscillations known as zero sound.

We have developed a state-of-the-art apparatus for laser-based spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometer spatial resolution
(micro-SARPES). This equipment is achieved through the combination of a
high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, a 6-eV laser with high photon flux
that is focused down to a few micrometers, a high-precision sample stage
control system, and a double very-low-energy-electron-diffraction spin
detector. The setup achieves an energy resolution of 1.5 (5.5) meV without
(with) the spin detection mode, compatible with a spatial resolution better
than 10 micrometers. This enables us to probe both spatially-resolved
electronic structures and vector information of spin polarization in three
dimensions. The performance of micro-SARPES apparatus is demonstrated by
presenting ARPES and SARPES results from topological insulators and Au
photolithography patterns on a Si (001) substrate.

Gate-defined quantum dots in silicon-germanium heterostructures have become a
compelling platform for quantum computation and simulation. Thus far,
developments have been limited to quantum dots defined in a single plane. Here,
we propose to advance beyond planar systems by exploiting heterostructures with
multiple quantum wells. We demonstrate the operation of a gate-defined vertical
double quantum dot in a strained germanium double quantum well. In quantum
transport measurements we observe stability diagrams corresponding to a double
quantum dot system. We analyze the capacitive coupling to the nearby gates and
find two quantum dots accumulated under the central plunger gate. We extract
the position and estimated size, from which we conclude that the double quantum
dots are vertically stacked in the two quantum wells. We discuss challenges and
opportunities and outline potential applications in quantum computing and
quantum simulation.

Boundaries of Walker-Wang models have been used to construct commuting
projector models which realize chiral unitary modular tensor categories (UMTCs)
as boundary excitations. Given a UMTC $\mathcal{A}$ representing the Witt class
of an anomaly, the article [arXiv:2208.14018] gave a commuting projector model
associated to an $\mathcal{A}$-enriched unitary fusion category $\mathcal{X}$
on a 2D boundary of the 3D Walker-Wang model associated to $\mathcal{A}$. That
article claimed that the boundary excitations were given by the enriched
center/M\"uger centralizer $Z^\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{X})$ of $\mathcal{A}$ in
$Z(\mathcal{X})$.
In this article, we give a rigorous treatment of this 2D boundary model, and
we verify this assertion using topological quantum field theory (TQFT)
techniques, including skein modules and a certain semisimple algebra whose
representation category describes boundary excitations. We also use TQFT
techniques to show the 3D bulk point excitations of the Walker-Wang bulk are
given by the M\"uger center $Z_2(\mathcal{A})$, and we construct
bulk-to-boundary hopping operators $Z_2(\mathcal{A})\to
Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ reflecting how the UMTC of boundary excitations
$Z^{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{X})$ is symmetric-braided enriched in
$Z_2(\mathcal{A})$.
This article also includes a self-contained comprehensive review of the
Levin-Wen string net model from a unitary tensor category viewpoint, as opposed

<h3>Mean field theory of chaotic insect swarms</h3>

<br>
<br>
The harmonically confined Vicsek model displays qualitative and quantitative
features observed in natural insect swarms. It exhibits a scale free transition
between single and multicluster chaotic phases. Finite size scaling indicates
that this unusual phase transition occurs at zero confinement [Physical Review
E 107, 014209 (2023)]. While the evidence of the scale-free-chaos phase
transition comes from numerical simulations, here we present its mean field
theory. Analytically determined critical exponents are those of the Landau
theory of equilibrium phase transitions plus dynamical critical exponent $z=1$
and a new critical exponent $\varphi=0.5$ for the largest Lyapunov exponent.
The phase transition occurs at zero confinement and noise in the mean field
theory. The noise line of zero largest Lyapunov exponents informs observed
behavior: (i) the qualitative shape of the swarm (on average, the center of
mass rotates slowly at the rate marked by the winding number and its trajectory
fills compactly the space, similarly to the observed condensed nucleus
surrounded by vapor), and (ii) the critical exponents resemble those observed
in natural swarms. Our predictions include power laws for the frequency of the
maximal spectral amplitude and the winding number.

<h3>Energy storage properties of ferroelectric nanocomposites</h3>

<br>
An atomistic effective Hamiltonian technique is used to investigate the
finite-temperature energy storage properties of a ferroelectric nanocomposite
consisting of an array of BaTiO$_{3}$ nanowires embedded in a SrTiO$_{3}$
matrix, for electric field applied along the long axis of the nanowires. We
find that the energy density \textit{versus} temperature curve adopts a
nonlinear, mostly temperature-independent response when the system exhibits
phases possessing an out-of-plane polarization and vortices while the energy
density more linearly increases with temperature when the nanocomposite either
only possesses vortices (and thus no spontaneous polarization) or is in a
paraelectric and paratoroidic phase for its equilibrium state. Ultrahigh energy
density up to $\simeq$140 J/cm$^{3}$ and an ideal 100% efficiency are also
predicted in this nanocomposite. A phenomenological model, involving a coupling
between polarization and toroidal moment, is further proposed to interpret
these energy density results.

<h3>Topological nature of the proper spin current and the spin-Hall torque</h3>

Spin currents driven by spin-orbit coupling are key to spin torque devices,
but determining the proper spin current is highly non-trivial. Here we derive a
general quantum-mechanical formula for the intrinsic proper spin current
showing that it is a topological quantity, and can be finite even in the gap.
We determine the spin-Hall current due to the bulk states of topological
insulators both deep in the bulk, where the system is unmagnetized, and near
the interface, where a proximity-induced magnetization is present, as well as
for low-dimensional spin-3/2 hole systems.

<br>

<br>
<br>
Thermoelectric effects in normal metals and superconductors are usually very
small due to the presence of electron-hole symmetry. Here, we show that
superconducting junctions brought out of equilibrium manifest a sizable bipolar
thermoelectric effect that stems from a strong violation of the detailed
balance. To fully control the effect, we consider a thermally biased SIS'IS
junction where the capacitance of the central S' region is small enough to
establish a Coulomb blockade regime. By exploiting charging effects we are able
to tune the Seebeck voltage, the thermocurrent, and thereby the power output of
this structure, via an external gate. We then analyse the main figures of merit
of bipolar thermoelectricity and we prospect for possible applications.

<br>
<br>
The quantum phase transition of the long-range transverse-field Ising model
is explored by combining a quantum Monte Carlo method with the optimal
computational complexity scaling and stochastic parameter optimization that
renders space and imaginary time isotropic, specifically achieved by tuning
correlation lengths. Varying the decay rate of the long-range interaction, we
exhaustively calculate the dynamical critical exponent and the other exponents
precisely in mean-field, nonuniversal, and Ising universality regimes. In our
simulations, critical properties are extracted only from a set of simulations
with different $L$, significantly improving computational cost compared to the
standard finite-size scaling approach based on data collapse. We also perform a
hypothesis test at the predicted universality boundary, which supports
preceding reports arguing that conventional theoretical prediction fails to
locate the universality boundary.

<h3>Three-dimensional atomic positions and local chemical order of medium-  and high-entropy alloys</h3>

<br>
<br>
Medium- and high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs) mix multiple principal elements with
near-equiatomic composition and represent a paradigm-shift strategy for
designing new materials for metallurgy, catalysis, and other fields. One of the
core hypotheses of M/HEAs is lattice distortion. However, experimentally
determining the 3D local lattice distortion in M/HEAs remains a challenge.
Additionally, the presumed random elemental mixing in M/HEAs has been
questioned by atomistic simulations, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
(EDS), and electron diffraction, which suggest the existence of local chemical
order in M/HEAs. However, the 3D local chemical order has eluded direct
experimental observation since the EDS elemental maps integrate the composition
of atomic columns along the zone axes, and the diffuse reflections/streaks in
electron diffraction of M/HEAs may originate from planar defects. Here, we
determine the 3D atomic positions of M/HEA nanocrystals using atomic electron
tomography, and quantitatively characterize the local lattice distortion,
strain tensor, twin boundaries, dislocation cores, and chemical short-range
order (CSRO) with unprecedented 3D detail. We find that the local lattice
distortion and strain tensor in the HEAs are larger and more heterogeneous than
in the MEAs. We observe CSRO-mediated twinning in the MEAs. that is, twinning
occurs in energetically unfavoured CSRO regions but not in energetically
favoured CSRO ones. This observation confirms the atomistic simulation results
of the bulk CrCoNi MEA and represents the first experimental evidence of
correlating local chemical order with structural defects in any material
system. We expect that this work will not only expand our fundamental
understanding of this important class of materials, but also could provide the
foundation for tailoring M/HEA properties through lattice distortion and local
chemical order.

<br>
<i>Davide Piccioni, Christian Apostoli, Federico Becca, Guglielmo Mazzola, Alberto Parola, Sandro Sorella, Giuseppe E. Santoro</i>
<br>
<br>
We show that a two-body Jastrow wave function is able to capture the
ground-state properties of the $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with
the single-ion anisotropy term, in both the topological and trivial phases.
Here, the optimized Jastrow pseudo potential assumes a very simple form in
Fourier space, i.e., $v_{q} \approx 1/q^2$, which is able to give rise to a
finite string-order parameter in the topological regime. The results are
analysed by using an exact mapping from the quantum expectation values over the
variational state to the classical partition function of the one-dimensional
Coulomb gas of particles with charge $q=\pm 1$. Here, two phases are present at
low temperatures: the first one is a diluted gas of dipoles (bound states of
particles with opposite charges), which are randomly oriented (describing the
trivial phase); the other one is a dense liquid of dipoles, which are aligned
thanks to the residual dipole-dipole interactions (describing the topological
phase, with the finite string order being related to the dipole alignment). Our
results provide an insightful interpretation of the ground-state nature of the
spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model.

<i>Takahiro Yokoyama, Yusei Kobayashi, Noriyoshi Arai, Arash Nikoubashman</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the self-assembly of amphiphilic nanocubes under rest and
shear using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
calculations. These particles combine both interaction and shape anisotropy,
making them valuable models for studying folded proteins and DNA-functionalized
nanoparticles. The nanocubes can self-assemble into various finite-sized
aggregates ranging from rods to self-avoiding random walks, depending on the
number and placement of the hydrophobic faces. Our study focuses on suspensions
containing multi- and one-patch cubes, with their ratio systematically varied.
When the binding energy is comparable to the thermal energy, the aggregates
consist of only few cubes that spontaneously associate/dissociate. However,
highly stable aggregates emerge when the binding energy exceeds the thermal
energy. Generally, the mean aggregation number of the self-assembled clusters
increases with the number of hydrophobic faces and decreases with the fraction
of one-patch cubes. In sheared suspensions, the more frequent collisions
between nanocube clusters lead to faster aggregation dynamics but also to
smaller terminal steady-state mean cluster sizes. The MD and KMC simulations
are in excellent agreement, and the analysis of the rate kernels enables the
identification of the primary mechanisms responsible for the (shear-induced)
cluster growth and breakup.

<br>
<br>
Stereolithographic 3D-printing (SLA) permits facile fabrication of
high-precision microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip devices. SLA photopolymers often
yield parts with low mechanical compliancy in sharp contrast to elastomers such
as poly (dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS). On the other hand, SLA-printable elastomers
with soft mechanical properties do not fulfill the distinct requirements for a
highly manufacturable resin in microfluidics (e.g., high-resolution
printability, transparency, low-viscosity). These limitations restrict our
ability to SLA-print efficient microfluidic actuators containing dynamic,
movable elements. Here we introduce low-viscous photopolymer resins based on a
tunable blend of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA, Mw~258) and poly
(ethylene glycol methyl ether) methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mw~300) monomers. In
these blends, which we term PEGDA-co-PEGMEMA, tuning the PEGMEMA-to-PEGDA ratio
alters the elastic modulus of the printed plastics by ~400-fold, reaching that
of PDMS. Through the addition of PEGMEMA, moreover, PEGDA-co-PEGMEMA retains
desirable properties of highly manufacturable PEGDA such as low viscosity,
solvent compatibility, cytocompatibility and low drug absorptivity. With
PEGDA-co-PEGMEMA, we SLA-printed drastically enhanced fluidic actuators
including microvalves, micropumps, and microregulators with a hybrid structure
containing a flexible PEGDA-co-PEGMEMA membrane within a rigid PEGDA housing.

<br>
<br>
In many physical situations, there appears the problem of reaching a single
target that is spatially distributed. Here we analyse how stochastic resetting,
also spatially distributed, can be used to improve the search process when the
target location is quenched, i.e. it does not evolve in time. More
specifically, we consider a model with minimal but sufficient ingredients that
allows us to derive analytical results for the relevant physical quantities,
such as the first passage time distribution. We focus on the minimisation of
the mean first passage time and its fluctuations (standard deviation), which
proves to be non-trivial. Our analysis shows that the no-disorder case is
singular: for small disorder, the resetting rate distribution that minimises
the mean first passage time leads to diverging fluctuations -- which impinge on
the practicality of this minimisation. Interestingly, this issue is healed by
minimising the fluctuations: the associated resetting rate distribution gives
first passage times that are very close to the optimal ones.

<br>
<br>
The impact of proximity-induced spin-orbit and exchange coupling on the
correlated phase diagram of rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) is
investigated theoretically. By employing \emph{ab initio}-fitted effective
models of RTG encapsulated by transition metal dichalcogenides (spin-orbit
proximity effect) and ferromagnetic Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (exchange proximity
effect), we incorporate the Coulomb interactions within the random-phase
approximation to explore potential correlated phases at different displacement
field and doping. We find a rich spectrum of spin-valley resolved Stoner and
intervalley coherence instabilities induced by the spin-orbit proximity
effects, such as the emergence of a \textit{spin-valley-coherent} phase due to
the presence of valley-Zeeman coupling. Similarly, proximity exchange removes
the phase degeneracies by biasing the spin direction, enabling a
magneto-correlation effect -- strong sensitivity of the correlated phases to
the relative magnetization orientations (parallel or antiparallel) of the
encapsulating ferromagnetic layers.

The electronic properties of a hybrid system made of single-bilayer graphene
structures subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field are studied for the
zigzag boundaries of the junction, zigzag-1 (ZZ1) and zigzag-2 (ZZ2). These
later examples exhibit different behaviors that have been investigated using
the continuum Dirac model. Our results reveal that the conductance depends on
the width of bilayer graphene for ZZ1 and shows maxima for ZZ2 as a function of
the magnetic field, in contrast to ZZ1. It is found that interfaces have
significant impacts on the transmission probability, with the confinement of
the ZZ1 boundary being more substantial than that of ZZ2

<br>
<br>
Nanoscale ferroelectric 2D materials offer unique opportunity to investigate
curvature and strain effects on materials functionalities. Among these,
CuInP2S6 (CIPS) has attracted tremendous research interest in recent years due
to combination of room temperature ferroelectricity, scalability to a few
layers thickness, and unique ferrielectric properties due to coexistence of 2
polar sublattices. Here, we explore the local curvature and strain effect on
the polarization in CIPS via piezoresponse force microscopy and spectroscopy.
To explain the observed behaviors and decouple the curvature and strain effects
in 2D CIPS, we introduce finite element Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire model. The
results show that bending induces ferrielectric domains in CIPS, and the
polarization-voltage hysteresis loops differ in bending and non-bending
regions. Our simulation indicates that the flexoelectric effect can affect
local polarization hysteresis. These studies open a novel pathway for the
fabrication of curvature-engineered nanoelectronic devices.

We theoretically study gate-defined one-dimensional channels in planar Ge
hole gases as a potential platform for non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. We
model the valence band holes in the Ge channel by adding appropriate
confinement potentials to the 3D Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian, additionally
taking into account a magnetic field applied parallel to the channel, an
out-of-plane electric field, as well as the effect of compressive strain in the
parent quantum well. Assuming that the Ge channel is proximitized by an
$s$-wave superconductor (such as, e.g., Al) we calculate the topological phase
diagrams for different channel geometries, showing that sufficiently narrow Ge
hole channels can indeed enter a topological superconducting phase with
Majorana zero modes at the channel ends. We estimate the size of the
topological gap and its dependence on various system parameters such as channel
width, strain, and the applied out-of-plane electric field, allowing us to
critically discuss under which conditions Ge hole channels may manifest
Majorana zero modes. Since ultra-clean Ge quantum wells with hole mobilities
exceeding one million and mean-free paths on the order of many microns already
exist, gate-defined Ge hole channels may be able to overcome some of the
problems caused by the presence of substantial disorder in more conventional
Majorana platforms.

Numerical simulations are performed on the collective dynamics of active
disks, whose self-propulsion speed ($U$) varies in time, and whose orientation
evolves according to rotational Brownian motion. Two protocols for the
evolution of speed are considered: (i) a deterministic one involving a periodic
change in U at a frequency $\omega$; and (ii) a stochastic one in which the
speeds are drawn from a power-law distribution at time-intervals governed by a
Poissonian process of rate $\beta$. In the first case, an increase in $\omega$
causes the disks to go from a clustered state to a homogeneous one through a
transition that has an intriguing analogy to the 2D Ising model, provided that
the direction of self-propulsion is allowed to reverse. Similarly, in the
second case, for a fixed value of $\beta$, the extent of cluster-breakup is
larger when reversals in the self-propulsion direction are permitted.
Motility-induced phase separation of the disks may therefore be avoided in
active matter suspensions in which the constituents are allowed to reverse
their self-propulsion direction, immaterial of the precise temporal nature of
the reversal (deterministic or stochastic). Equally, our results demonstrate
that phase separation could occur even in the absence of a time-averaged
motility of an individual active agent, provided that the rate of direction
reversals is smaller than the orientational diffusion rate.

The work of Ahn derives the noise power spectrum of a two-level fluctuator
(TLF) in the case that it interacts only with a subregion of a full electron
bath and thus is subject to a fluctuating temperature. However, Eq.~(1), which
gives the variance of the subbath temperature in terms of the heat capacity, in
that work carries the implicit assumption that the heat capacity of this
subbath may be taken to be a constant, which is a good approximation at higher
temperatures, but breaks down at lower temperatures. We thus extend this work
to the case in which the fact that the electronic heat capacity of a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) $C_V\propto T$, rather than constant in
temperature, is fully taken into account. We show that, at low temperatures,
the resulting power spectrum of the noise $S(\omega)\propto e^{-C/T^{3/8}}$, in
contrast to $S(\omega)\propto e^{-C'/T^{1/3}}$ as found previously, where $C$
and $C'$ are constants. We also compare the numerical results that one would
obtain from the two models and find that our results for $S(\omega)$ can differ
from those of Ahn by several orders of magnitude at low temperatures.
