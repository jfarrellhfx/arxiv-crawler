<h3>Ion-beam Assisted Sputtering of Titanium Nitride Thin Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15065" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15065</a>

Titanium nitride is a material of interest for many superconducting devices
such as nanowire microwave resonators and photon detectors. Thus, controlling
the growth of TiN thin films with desirable properties is of high importance.
In previous work on niobium nitride, ion beam-assisted sputtering (IBAS)
reduced nitrogen sensitivity during deposition in tandem with an increase in
nominal critical temperature. We have deposited thin films of titanium nitride
by both, the conventional method of DC reactive magnetron sputtering and the
IBAS method and compare their superconducting critical temperatures Tc as
functions of thickness, sheet resistance, and nitrogen flow rate. We perform
electrical and structural characterizations by electric transport and X-ray
diffraction measurements. Compared to the conventional method of reactive
sputtering, the IBAS technique has demonstrated a 10% increase in nominal
critical temperature and 33% reduced sensitivity to nitrogen flow, without
noticeable variation in the lattice structure. Additionally, we explore the
behavior of superconducting Tc in ultra-thin films. Trends in films grown at
high nitrogen concentrations follow predictions of mean-field theory in
disordered films and show suppression of superconducting Tc due to geometric
effects, while nitride films grown at low nitrogen concentrations strongly
deviate from the theoretical models.

Recent experiments have established that semiconductor-based moir\'e
materials can host incompressible states at a series of fractional
moir\'e-miniband fillings. These states have been identified as generalized
Wigner crystals in which electrons localize on a subset of the available
triangular-lattice moir\'e superlattice sites. In this article, we use
momentum-space exact diagonalization to investigate the many-body ground state
evolution at rational fillings from the weak-hopping classical lattice gas
limit, in which only spin degrees-of-freedom are active at low energies, to the
strong-hopping metallic regime where the Wigner crystals melt. We specifically
address the nature of the magnetic ground states of the generalized Wigner
crystals at fillings $\nu$ = 1/3 and $\nu$ = 2/3.

Bulk dislocation lattice defects are instrumental to identify translationally
active topological insulators (TATIs), featuring band inversion at a finite
momentum (${\bf K}_{\rm inv}$). TATIs host robust gapless modes around the
dislocation core, when the associated Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) satisfies
${\bf K}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo $2 \pi$). From the time evolution
of appropriate density matrices, we show that when a TATI via a real time ramp
enters into a trivial or topological insulating phase, devoid of any gapless
dislocation mode, signatures of the preramp defect modes survive for a long
time. More intriguingly, as the system ramps into a TATI phase from any
translationally inert insulators, signature of the dislocation mode dynamically
builds up near the defect core, which is more prominent for slow ramps. We
exemplify these generic outcomes for two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry
breaking insulators. Proposed dynamic responses at the dislocation core can be
experimentally observed on quantum crystals, optical lattices and metamaterials
with time tunable band gap.

<h3>Multiferroicity and Topology in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h3>

Van der Waals heterostructures have recently emerged as an exciting platform
for investigating the effects of strong electronic correlations, including
various forms of magnetic or electrical orders. Here, we perform an unbiased
exact diagonalization study of the effects of interactions on topological flat
bands of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at odd integer
fillings. We find that Chern insulator phases, expected from
interaction-induced spin and valley polarization of the bare band structure,
are quite fragile, and give way to spontaneous multiferroic order -- coexisting
ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, in presence of long-range Coulomb
repulsion. We provide a simple real-space picture to understand the phase
diagram as a function of interaction range and strength. Our findings establish
twisted TMDs as a novel and highly tunable platform for multiferroicity, with
potential applications to electrical control of magnetism.

<h3>Robust charge-density wave correlations in the electron-doped  single-band Hubbard model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14930" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14930</a>

<br>
<br>
There is growing evidence that the hole-doped single-band Hubbard and $t$-$J$
models do not have a superconducting ground state reflective of the
high-temperature cuprate superconductors but instead have striped spin- and
charge-ordered ground states. Nevertheless, it is proposed that these models
may still provide an effective low-energy model for electron-doped materials.
Here we study the finite temperature spin and charge correlations in the
electron-doped Hubbard model using quantum Monte Carlo dynamical cluster
approximation calculations and contrast their behavior with those found on the
hole-doped side of the phase diagram. We find evidence for a charge modulation
with both checkerboard and unidirectional components decoupled from any
spin-density modulations. These correlations are inconsistent with a
weak-coupling description based on Fermi surface nesting, and their doping
dependence agrees qualitatively with resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
measurements. Our results provide evidence that the single-band Hubbard model
describes the electron-doped cuprates.

<h3>Anomalous skew-scattering nonlinear Hall effect in $PT$-symmetric  antiferromagnets</h3>

Berry curvature and skew-scattering play central roles in determining both
the linear and nonlinear anomalous Hall effects. Yet in $PT$-symmetric
antiferromagnetic metals, Hall effects from either intrinsic Berry curvature
mediated anomalous velocity or the conventional skew-scattering process
individually vanish. Here we reveal an unexpected nonlinear Hall effect that
relies on both Berry curvature and skew-scattering working in cooperation. This
anomalous skew-scattering nonlinear Hall effect (ASN) is $PT$-even and
dominates the low-frequency nonlinear Hall effect for $PT$-symmetric
antiferromagnetic metals. Surprisingly, we find that in addition to its Hall
response, ASN produces helicity dependent photocurrents, in contrast to other
known $PT$-even nonlinearities in metals which are helicity blind. This
characteristic enables to isolate ASN and establishes new photocurrent tools to
interrogate the antiferromagnetic order of $PT$-symmetric metals.

<h3>G-crossed Modularity of Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases</h3>

The universal properties of (2 + 1)D topological phases of matter enriched by
a symmetry group G are described by G-crossed extensions of unitary modular
tensor categories (UMTCs). While the fusion and braiding properties of
quasiparticles associated with the topological order are described by a UMTC,
the G-crossed extensions further capture the properties of the symmetry action,
fractionalization, and defects arising from the interplay of the symmetry with
the topological order. We describe the relation between the G-crossed UMTC and
the topological state spaces on general surfaces that may include symmetry
defect branch lines and boundaries that carry topological charge. We define
operators in terms of the G-crossed UMTC data that represent the mapping class
transformations for such states on a torus with one boundary, and show that
these operators provide projective representations of the mapping class groups.
This allows us to represent the mapping class group on general surfaces and
ensures a consistent description of the corresponding symmetry-enriched
topological phases on general surfaces. Our analysis also enables us to prove
that a faithful G-crossed extension of a UMTC is necessarily G-crossed modular.

<h3>Bolometric detection of coherent Josephson coupling in a highly  dissipative environment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14953" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14953</a>

<br>
<br>
The Josephson junction is a building block of quantum circuits. Its behavior,
well understood when treated as an isolated entity, is strongly affected by
coupling to an electromagnetic environment. In 1983 Schmid predicted that a
Josephson junction shunted by a resistance exceeding the resistance quantum
$\mathbf{\textit{R}}_\mathrm{Q} = h/4e^2 \approx 6.45$ k$\mathbf{\Omega}$ for
Cooper pairs would become insulating since the phase fluctuations would destroy
the coherent Josephson coupling. Although this prediction has been confirmed in
charge transport experiments, recent microwave measurements have questioned
this interpretation. Here, we insert a small junction in a Johnson-Nyquist type
setup, where it is driven by weak current noise arising from thermal
fluctuations. Our heat probe minimally perturbs the junction's equilibrium,
shedding light on features not visible in charge transport. We find that while
charge transport through the junction is dissipative as expected, thermal
transport is determined by the inductive-like Josephson response, unambiguously
demonstrating that a supercurrent survives even deep into the expected
insulating regime. The discrepancy between these two measurements highlights
the difference between the low frequency and the high frequency response of a
junction and calls for further theoretical and experimental inputs on the
dynamics of Josephson junctions in a highly dissipative environment.

<h3>Dynamic Hardness Evolution in Metals from Impact Induced Gradient  Dislocation Density</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14976" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14976</a>

<br>
<br>
A clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of metals is critical for
developing superior structural materials as well as for improving material
processing techniques such as cold spray and shot peening. Using a
high-velocity (from 120 m/s to 550 m/s; strain rates >10^7 1/s)
micro-projectile impact testing and quasistatic (strain rates: 10^-2 1/s)
nanoindentation, we investigate the strain-rate-dependent mechanical behavior
of single-crystal aluminum substrates with (001), (011), and (111) crystal
orientations. Independent of crystal orientation, the dynamic hardness
initially increases with increasing impact velocity and reaches a plateau
regime at hardness 5 times higher than that of at quasistatic indentations.
Based on coefficient of restitution and post-mortem transmission Kikuchi
diffraction analyses, we show that distinct plastic deformation mechanisms with
a gradient dislocation density evolution govern the dynamic behavior. We also
discover a distinct deformation regime-stable plastic regime-that emerge beyond
the deeply plastic regime with unique strain rate insensitive microstructure
evolution and dynamic hardness. Our work additionally demonstrates an effective
approach to introduce strong spatial gradient in dislocation density in metals
by high-velocity projectile impacts to enhance surface mechanical properties,
as it can be employed in material processing techniques such as shot peening
and surface mechanical attrition treatment.

<h3>Anharmonic multiphonon origin of the valence plasmon in SrTi1-xNbxO3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Doped SrTi1-xNbxO3 exhibits superconductivity and a mid-infrared optical
response reminiscent of copper-oxide superconductors. Strangely, its plasma
frequency, omega_p, increases by a factor of ~3 when cooling from 300 K to 20
K, without any accepted explanation. Here, we present momentum-resolved
electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS) measurements of SrTi1-xNbxO3 at
nonzero momentum, q. We find that the infrared feature previously identified as
a plasmon is present at large q in insulating SrTiO3, where it exhibits the
same temperature dependence and may be identified as an anharmonic, multiphonon
background. Doping with Nb increases its peak energy and total spectral weight,
drawing this background to lower q where it becomes visible in IR optics
experiments. We conclude that the "plasmon" in doped SrTi1-xNbxO3 is not a
free-carrier mode, but a composite excitation that inherits its unusual
properties from the lattice anharmonicity of the insulator.

<h3>Edge channels in a graphene Fabry-Perot interferometer</h3>

<br>
<br>
Quantum-mechanical calculations of electron magnetotransport in graphene
Fabry-Perot interferometers are presented. The role of edge channels, and their
spatial structure, on Aharonov-Bohm interference is elucidated. For an
interferometer that is made by removing carbon atoms, which is typically
realized in nanolithography experiments, the constrictions are shown to cause
strong inter-channel scattering that establishes local equilibrium over a short
distance and makes the electron transport non-adiabatic. Nevertheless,
two-terminal conductance is found to reveal a common Aharonov-Bohm oscillation
pattern, which is accompanied by single-particle states that sweep through the
Fermi energy for the edge channels circulating along the physical boundary of
the device. Conductance oscillations are independent of graphene
crystallographic orientation. It is also found that the interferometer
constrictions host the localized states that might shorten the device or
disrupt the oscillation pattern. For an interferometer that is created by
electrostatic confinement, which is typically done in the split-gate
experiments, electron transport is shown to be adiabatic, similar to the
well-studied regime in traditional GaAs-based interferometers.

Charge state recognition in quantum dot devices is important in preparation
of quantum bits for quantum information processing. Towards auto-tuning of
larger-scale quantum devices, automatic charge state recognition by machine
learning has been demonstrated. In this work, we propose a simpler method using
machine learning and pre-processing. We demonstrate the operation of the charge
state recognition and evaluated an accuracy high as 96%. We also analyze the
explainability of the trained machine learning model by gradient-weighted class
activation mapping (Grad-CAM) which identifies class-discriminative regions for
the predictions. It exhibits that the model predicts the state based on the
change transition lines, indicating human-like recognition is realized.

<h3>Oxygen vacancies at the origin of pinned moments in oxide interfaces:  the example of tetragonal CuO/SrTiO$_3$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15084" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15084</a>

<br>
<br>
Obtaining an accurate theoretical description of the emergent phenomena in
oxide heterostructures is a major challenge. Recently, intriguing paramagnetic
spin and pinned orbital moments have been discovered by x-ray magnetic circular
dichro\"ism measurements at the Cu $L_{2,3}$-edge of a tetragonal CuO/SrTiO$_3$
heterostructure. Using first principles calculations, we propose a scenario
that explains both types of moments, based on the formation of oxygen vacancies
in the TiO$_2$ interface layer. We show the emergence of a paramagnetic 2D
electron gas hosted in the interface CuO layer. It is invisible at the Ti
$L_{2,3}$-edge since the valence of the Ti atoms remains unchanged. Strong
structural distortions breaking both the local and global fourfold rotation
$C_4$ symmetries at the interface lead to the in-plane pinning of the Cu
orbital moment close to the vacancy. Our results, and in particular the pinning
of the orbital moment, may have implications for other systems, especially
monoxide/dioxide interfaces with similar metal-oxygen bond length and weak
spin-orbit coupling.

<h3>Incommensurate antiferromagnetic order in weakly frustrated  two-dimensional van der Waals insulator CrPSe$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Although the magnetic order is suppressed by a strong magnetic frustration,
it is maintained but appears in complex order forms such as a cycloid or spin
density wave in weakly frustrated systems. Herein, we report a weakly
magnetic-frustrated two-dimensional van der Waals material CrPSe$_3$.
Polycrystalline CrPSe$_3$ was synthesized at an optimized temperature of
700$^\circ$C to avoid the formation of any secondary phases (e.g.,
Cr$_2$Se$_3$). The antiferromagnetic transition appeared at $T_N\sim 126$ K
with a large Curie-Weiss temperature $T_{\rm CW} \sim -371$ via magnetic
susceptibility measurements, indicating weak frustration in CrPSe$_3$ with a
frustration factor $f (|T_{\rm CW}|/T_N) \sim 3$. Evidently, the formation of
long-range incommensurate spin-density wave antiferromagnetic order with the
propagation vector $k = (0, 0.04, 0)$ was revealed by neutron diffraction
measurements at low temperatures (below 120K). The monoclinic crystal structure
of C2/m symmetry is preserved over the studied temperature range down to 20K,
as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy measurements. Our findings on the spin
density wave antiferromagnetic order in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic
materials, not previously observed in the MPX$_3$ family, are expected to
enrich the physics of magnetism at the 2D limit, thereby opening opportunities
for their practical applications in spintronics and quantum devices.

<h3>Competition-Induced Sign Reversal of Casimir-Lifshitz Torque: An  Investigation on Topological Node-Line Semimetal</h3>

<br>
<br>
The dispersion of quasiparticles in topological node-line semimetals is
significantly different in different directions. In a certain direction, the
quasiparticles behave like relativistic particles with constant velocity. In
other directions, they act as two-dimensional electron gas. The competition
between relativistic and nonrelativistic dispersions can induce a sign reversal
of Casimir-Lifshitz torque. Three different approaches can be applied to
generate this sign reversal, i.e., tuning the anisotropic parameter or chemical
potential in node-line semimetal, changing the distance between this material
and substrate birefringence. Detailed calculations are illustrated for the
system with topological node-line semimetal Ca$_3$P$_2$ and liquid crystal
material 4-cyano-4-n-pentylcyclohexane-phenyl.

<h3>Confined states in the tight-binding model on the hexagonal golden-mean  tiling</h3>

<br>
<i>Toranosuke Matsubara, Akihisa Koga, Sam Coates</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the tight-binding model with two distinct hoppings $(t_L, t_S)$ on
the two-dimensional hexagonal golden-mean tiling and examine the confined
states with $E=0$, where $E$ is the eigenenergy. Some confined states found in
the case $t_L=t_S$ are exact eigenstates even for the system with $t_L \neq
t_S$, where their amplitudes are smoothly changed. By contrast, the other
states are no longer eigenstates of the system with $t_L \neq t_S$. This may
imply the existence of macroscopically degenerate states which are
characteristic of the system with $t_L=t_S$, and that a discontinuity appears
in the number of the confined states in the thermodynamic limit.

<h3>Phase transitions and topological properties of the 5/2 quantum Hall  states with strong Landau-level mixing</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15117</a>
<br>
<i>Wenchen Luo, Wei Zhang, Yutao Hu, Hao Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We numerically study a 5/2 fractional quantum Hall system with even number of
electrons using the exact diagonalization where both the strong Landau level
(LL) mixing and a finite width of the quantum well have been considered and
adapted into a screened Coulomb interaction. With the principal component
analysis, we are able to recognize a compressible-incompressible phase
transition in the parameter space made of the magnetic field and the quantum
well width by the competition between the first two leading components of the
ground states wave functions, which is consistent with the low-lying spectral
feature and previous works in the odd-electron system. In addition, the
presence of the subdominant third component suggests an incompressible
transition occurring as the LL-mixing strength grows into a certain parameter
region associated with the ZnO experiments. We further investigate the strongly
LL-mixed phase in this emerging region with the Hall viscosity, wave function
overlaps, and the entanglement spectra. Results show it can be well described
as a particle-hole symmetrized Pfaffian state with the dual topological
properties of the Pfaffian and the anti-Pfaffian states.

<h3>The criterion of planar instability in alloy solidification under  dynamic conditions: A viewpoint from free energy</h3>

<i>Fengyi Yu</i>
<br>

An accurate prediction of the solidification structures could provide a
theoretical basis for optimizing the parameters and improving the mechanical
properties of components. In alloy solidification, the transport processes of
heat and solute result in morphological instability of the interface, forming
different patterns of solidification structure. As the first observable
phenomenon of the morphological instabilities, the planar instability
influences the subsequent stages significantly, deserving in-depth
investigations. In this paper, the planar instability in alloy solidification
under dynamic conditions is studied. Firstly, the dynamics of the planar
instability is performed by the theoretical model and phase-field model,
respectively. Secondly, to represent the history-dependence of solidification,
the dynamic parameters are adopted in the simulations. Then the criterion of
the planar instability under dynamic conditions is discussed. This paper
considers the critical parameters of the planar instability are the excess free
energy at the interface and corresponding interface energy. Finally, to
validate the criterion, the comparisons between the phase-field model and
theoretical model are carried out, showing good consistency. Moreover,
solidification processes with different preferred crystallographic orientations
are performed, demonstrating the effect mechanism of the excess free energy and
interface energy on the planar instability. The idea of the interface energy
influencing the planar instability could be applied to investigating other
patterns induced by interface instability.

<h3>Generalizability of Functional Forms for Interatomic Potential Models  Discovered by Symbolic Regression</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15124" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15124</a>

<i>Alberto Hernandez, Tim Mueller</i>
<br>
<br>
In recent years there has been great progress in the use of machine learning
algorithms to develop interatomic potential models. Machine-learned potential
models are typically orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory
but also orders of magnitude slower than physics-derived models such as the
embedded atom method. In our previous work, we used symbolic regression to
develop fast, accurate and transferrable interatomic potential models for
copper with novel functional forms that resemble those of the embedded atom
method. To determine the extent to which the success of these forms was
specific to copper, here we explore the generalizability of these models to
other elements and analyze their out-of-sample performance on several material
properties. We found that these forms work particularly well on elements that
are chemically similar to copper. When compared to optimized Sutton-Chen
models, which have similar complexity, the functional forms discovered using
symbolic regression perform better across all elements considered except gold
where they have a similar performance. They perform similarly to a moderately
more complex embedded atom form on properties on which they were trained, and
they are more accurate on average on other properties. We attribute this
improved generalized accuracy to the relative simplicity of the models
discovered using symbolic regression. The genetic programming models are found
to outperform other models from the literature about 50% of the time, with
about 1/10th the model complexity on average. We discuss the implications of
these results to the broader application of symbolic regression to the
development of new potentials and highlight how models discovered for one
element can be used to seed new searches for different elements.

To assess the potential optoelectronic applications of metal-halide
perovskites, it is critical to have a detailed understanding of the nature,
strength, and dynamics of the interactions between carriers and the polar
lattices. Here, we report the electronic and structural dynamics of
bismuth-based perovskite $\textrm{Cs}_{3}\textrm{Bi}_{2}\textrm{I}_{9}$
revealed by transient reflectivity and ultrafast electron diffraction. A
cross-examination of these experimental results combined with theoretical
analyses allows the identification of the major carrier-phonon coupling
mechanism and the associated time scales. It is found that carriers
photoinjected into $\textrm{Cs}_{3}\textrm{Bi}_{2}\textrm{I}_{9}$ form
self-trapped excitons on an ultrafast time scale. However, they retain most of
their energy and their coupling to Fr\"ohlich-type optical phonons is limited
at early times. Instead, the long-lived excitons exert an electronic stress via
deformation potential and develop a prominent, sustaining strain field as
coherent acoustic phonons in 10 ps. From sub-ps to ns and beyond, a similar
extent of the atomic displacements is found throughout the different stages of
structural distortions, from limited local modulations to a coherent strain
field to the Debye-Waller random atomic motions on longer times. The current
results suggest the potential use of bismuth-based perovskites for applications
other than photovoltaics to take advantage of carriers' stronger self-trapping
and long lifetime.

We experimentally investigated the detection performance of highly disordered
NbxTi1-xN based superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). The
dependence on the composition of the transition temperature Tc for NbxTi1-xN
films show a dome-like behavior on the Nb content, with a maximal Tc at
xNb~0.65 , and the Nb0.65Ti0.35N films also combine relatively large sheet
resistance and intermediate residual resistivity ratio. Moreover, 60-nm-wide
and 7-nm-thick Nb0.65Ti0.35N nanowires show a switching current as high as 14.5
uA, and saturated intrinsic detection efficiency with a plateau of more than 2
uA at 2.4 K. Finally, the corresponding SNSPDs on an alternative SiO2/Ta2O5
dielectric mirror showed a system detection efficiency of approximately 92% for
1550 nm photons, and the timing jitter is around 26 ps. Our results demonstrate
that the highly disordered NbxTi1-xN films are promising for fabricating SNSPDs
for near- and middle-infrared single photons with high detection efficiency and
low timing jitter.

Floquet time crystal, which breaks discrete time-translation symmetry, is an
intriguing phenomenon in non-equilibrium systems. It is crucial to understand
the rigidity and robustness of discrete time crystal (DTC) phases in a
many-body system, and finding a precisely solvable model can pave a way for
understanding of the DTC phase. Here, we propose and study a solvable spin
chain model by mapping it to a Floquet superconductor through the Jordan-Wigner
transformation. The phase diagrams of Floquet topological systems are
characterized by topological invariants and tell the existence of anomalous
edge states. The sub-harmonic oscillation, which is the typical signal of the
DTC, can be generated from such edge states and protected by topology. We also
examine the robustness of the DTC by adding symmetry-preserving and
symmetry-breaking perturbations. Our results on topologically protected DTC can
provide a deep understanding of the DTC when generalized to other interacting
or dissipative systems.

<h3>Calculation of critical exponents on fractal lattice Ising model by  higher-order tensor renormalization group method</h3>

The critical behavior of the Ising model on a fractal lattice, which has the
Hausdorff dimension $\log_{4} 12 \approx 1.792$, is investigated using a
modified higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) algorithm
supplemented with automatic differentiation to compute relevant derivatives
efficiently and accurately. The complete set of critical exponents
characteristic of a second-order phase transition was obtained. Correlations
near the critical temperature were analyzed through two impurity tensors
inserted into the system, which allowed us to obtain the correlation lengths
and calculate the critical exponent $\nu$. The critical exponent $\alpha$ was
found to be negative, consistent with the observation that the specific heat
does not diverge at the critical temperature. The extracted exponents satisfy
the known relations given by various scaling assumptions within reasonable
accuracy. Perhaps most interestingly, the hyperscaling relation, which contains
the spatial dimension, is satisfied very well, assuming the Hausdorff dimension
takes the place of the spatial dimension. Moreover, using automatic
differentiation, we have extracted four critical exponents ($\alpha$, $\beta$,
$\gamma$, and $\delta$) globally by differentiating the free energy.
Surprisingly, the global exponents differ from those obtained locally by the
technique of the impurity tensors; however, the scaling relations remain
satisfied even in the case of the global exponents.

<h3>Electron-phonon mediated spin-flip as driving mechanism for ultrafast  magnetization dynamics in 3$d$ ferromagnets</h3>

<i>Theodor Griepe, Unai Atxitia</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite intense experimental effort, theoretical proposals and modeling
approaches, a lack of consensus exists about the intrinsic mechanisms driving
ultrafast magnetization dynamics in 3$d$ ferromagnets. In this work, we find
evidence of electron-phonon mediated spin-flip as the driving mechanism for the
ultrafast magnetization dynamics in all three 3$d$ ferromagnets; nickel, iron
and cobalt. We use a microscopic three temperature model with parameters
calculated from first-principles, which has been validated by direct comparison
to the electron and lattice dynamics extracted from previous experiments. By
direct comparison to the experimentally measured magnetization dynamics for
different laser fluence, we determine the spin-flip probability of each
material. In contrast to previous findings but in agreement to ab-initio
predictions, we find that relatively small values of the spin-flip probability
enable ultrafast demagnetization in all three 3$d$ ferromagnets.

Polymer gels such as jellies and soft contact lenses are soft solids
consisting of three-dimensional polymer networks swollen with a large amount of
solvent. For approximately 80 years, the swelling of polymer gels has been
described using the Flory--Huggins mean-field theory. However, this theory is
problematic when applied to polymer gels with large solvent contents owing to
the significant fluctuations in polymer concentration. In this study, we
experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the semidilute scaling law over
the mean-field theory for predicting the swelling of polymer gels. Using the
semidilute scaling law, we experimentally determine the universal critical
exponent $\nu$ of the self-avoiding walk via swelling experiments on polymer
gels. The experimentally obtained value $\nu\simeq 0.589$ is consistent with
the previously reported value of $\nu\simeq 0.588$, which was obtained by
precise numerical calculations. Furthermore, we theoretically derive and
experimentally demonstrate a scaling law that governs the equilibrium
concentrations. This scaling law contradicts the predictions made by de Gennes'
$c^{*}$ theorem. A major deficiency of the $c^*$ theorem is that the network
elasticity, which depends on the as-prepared state, is neglected. These
findings reveal that the semidilute scaling law is a fundamental principle for
accurately predicting and controlling the equilibrium swelling of polymer gels.

<h3>Effect of Majorana edge states on information propagation and scrambling  in a Floquet spin chain</h3>

<br>
<br>
The action of any local operator on a quantum system propagates through the
system carrying the information of the local operator. This is usually studied
via the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). We study the information
propagation from one end of a periodically driven spin-1/2 $XY$ chain with open
boundary conditions using the Floquet infinite-temperature OTOC. We calculate
the OTOC for two different spin operators, $\sigma^x$ and $\sigma^z$, and find
that they show quite different behaviors. The OTOC for the spin operator which
is local in terms of Jordan-Wigner fermions ($\sigma^z$) shows no signature of
information scrambling inside the light cone of propagation. On the contrary,
the OTOC for the spin operator which is non-local in terms of Jordan-Wigner
fermions ($\sigma^x$) shows signatures of scrambling inside the light cone. For
sinusoidal driving, the model can be shown to host different types of Majorana
edge states, namely topological zero quasienergy edge states and anomalous edge
states. The two different types of edge states influence the information
propagation in different ways. We observe a localization of information at the
edge for both $\sigma^z$ and $\sigma^x$ OTOCs whenever edge states are present.
In addition, in the case of anomalous edge states, we see oscillations of the
OTOC in time near the edge, the oscillation period being inversely proportional
to the gap between the Floquet eigenvalues of the edge states. We provide an
analytical understanding of these effects due to the edge states. We also
observe an `unscrambling effect' in the $\sigma^x$ OTOC after reflection at the
other end of the system. Finally, we demonstrate that the information
propagates into the system mainly via the bulk states with the maximum value of
the group velocity, and we show how this velocity is controlled by the driving
frequency and amplitude.

Besides its fundamental interest, understanding the dynamics of pair breaking
in superconducting nanostructures is a central issue to optimize the
performances of superconducting devices such as qubits or photon detectors.
However, despite substantial research efforts, these dynamics are still not
well understood as this requires experiments in which quasiparticles are
injected in a controlled fashion. Until now, such experiments have employed
solid-state tunnel junctions with a fixed tunnel barrier. Here we use instead a
cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope to tune independently the energy and
the rate of quasiparticle injection through, respectively, the bias voltage and
the tunnelling current. For high energy quasiparticles, we observe the
reduction of the critical current of a nanowire and show it is mainly
controlled by the injected power and, marginally, by the injection rate. Our
results prove a thermal mechanism for the reduction of the critical current and
unveil the rapid dynamics of the generated hot spot.

<br>
The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the frustrated diamond-decorated
square lattice is known to feature various zero-field ground-state phases,
consisting of extended monomer-dimer and dimer-tetramer ground states as well
as a ferrimagnetic regime. Using a combination of analytical arguments, density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exact diagonalization, as well as
sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, we investigate the
properties of this system and the related Lieb lattice in the presence of a
finite magnetic field, addressing both the ground-state phase diagram as well
as several thermodynamic properties. In addition to the zero-field ground
states, we find at high magnetic field a spin-canted phase with a continuously
rising magnetization for increasing magnetic field strength, as well as the
fully polarized paramagnetic phase. At intermediate field strength, we identify
a first-order quantum phase transition line between the ferrimagnetic and the
monomer-dimer regime. This first-order line extends to finite temperatures,
terminating in a line of critical points that belong to the universality class
of the two-dimensional Ising model.

<h3>Tuning the magnetic interactions in van der Waals Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$  heterostructures: A comparative study of \textit{ab initio} methods</h3>

We investigate the impact of mechanical strain, stacking order, and external
electric fields on the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional (2D) van der
Waals (vdW) heterostructure in which a 2D ferromagnetic metallic Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
monolayer is deposited on germanene. Three distinct computational approaches
based on \textit{ab initio} methods are used, and a careful comparison is
given: (i) The Green's function method, (ii) the generalized Bloch theorem, and
(iii) the supercell approach. First, the shell-resolved exchange constants are
calculated for the three Fe atoms within the unit cell of the freestanding
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayer. We find that the results between methods (i) and (ii)
are in good qualitative agreement and also with previously reported values. An
electric field of ${\cal E}= \pm 0.5$~V/{\AA} applied perpendicular to the
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene heterostructure leads to significant changes of the
exchange constants. We show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene is mainly dominated by the nearest neighbors,
resulting in a good quantitative agreement between methods (i) and (ii).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DMI is highly tunable by strain, stacking,
and electric field, leading to a large DMI comparable to that of
ferromagnetic/heavy metal (FM/HM) interfaces. The geometrical change and
hybridization effect explain the origin of the high tunability of the DMI at
the interface. The electric-field driven DMI obtained by method (iii) is in
qualitative agreement with the more accurate \textit{ab initio} method used in
approach (ii). However, the field-effect on the DMI is overestimated by method
(iii) by about 50\%. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy can also be
drastically changed by the application of compressive or tensile strain in the
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/germanene heterostructure.

Many-body transport has emerged as an efficient tool for understanding
interaction effects in quantum materials with a multi-band electronic
structure. This paper proposes a formula for the two-particle transmission
coefficient for Cooper-pair transport between multi-band normal and
superconducting materials. The approach employs a tight-binding nonequilibrium
Green's function technique, allowing a direct calculation of the two-particle
current, without invoking the paradigm of Andreev reflection. As an application
of the theory, we demonstrate a low-field linear magnetoresistance effect for
superconductors with an induced nonunitary order parameter. These results
uncover an unexplored route for detecting unconventional nonunitary
superconductivity in quantum materials of current theoretical and experimental
interest.

<br>
We consider a weakly-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that is
loaded into an optical lattice with a two-point basis, and described by a
two-band Bose-Hubbard model with generic one-body and two-body terms. By first
projecting the system to the lower Bloch band and then applying the Bogoliubov
approximation to the resultant Hamiltonian, we show that the inverse
effective-mass tensor of the superfluid carriers in the Bogoliubov spectrum has
two physically distinct contributions. In addition to the usual inverse
band-mass tensor that is originating from the intraband processes within the
lower Bloch band, there is also a quantum-geometric contribution that is
induced by the two-body interactions through the interband processes. We also
discuss the conditions under which the latter contribution is expressed in
terms of the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states, i.e., the natural
Fubini-Study metric on the Bloch sphere.

(OH)$_4$ is determined to be compatible with ab-initio calculations. The
results obtained in this work show that some previous speculations in the
literature about the couplings are correct, obtaining a model with a mixture of
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings. We use a combination of
numerical techniques to study the magnetic properties of the model. Our
numerical calculations based on the density-matrix renormalization group method
reveal that the system presents Ising-like magnetization plateaux at rational

We first derive the Hamilton-Jacobi theory underlying continuous-time Markov
processes, and then use the construction to develop a variational algorithm for
estimating escape (least improbable or first passage) paths for a generic
stochastic chemical reaction network that exhibits multiple fixed points. The
design of our algorithm is such that it is independent of the underlying
dimensionality of the system, the discretization control parameters are updated
towards the continuum limit, and there is an easy-to-calculate measure for the
correctness of its solution. We consider several applications of the algorithm
and verify them against computationally expensive means such as the shooting
method and stochastic simulation. While we employ theoretical techniques from
mathematical physics, numerical optimization and chemical reaction network
theory, we hope that our work finds practical applications with an
inter-disciplinary audience including chemists, biologists, optimal control
theorists and game theorists.

<br>
<br>
While important for many industrial applications, chemical reactions
responsible for charging of solids in water are often poorly understood. We
theoretically investigate the charging kinetics of solid-liquid interfaces, and
find that the time-dependent equilibration of surface charge contains key
information not only on the reaction mechanism, but also on the valency of the
reacting ions. We construct a non-linear differential equation describing
surface charging by combining chemical Langmuir kinetics and electrostatic
Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Our results reveal a clear distinction between
late-time (near-equilibrium) and short-time (far-from-equilibrium) relaxation
rates, the ratio of which contains information on the charge valency and ad- or
desorption mechanism of the charging process. Similarly, we find that
single-ion reactions can be distinguished from two-ion reactions as the latter
show an inflection point during equilibration. Interestingly, such inflection
points are characteristic of autocatalytic reactions, and we conclude that the
Coulombic ion-surface interaction is an autocatalytic feedback mechanism.

tensor-network map that connects the proposed grokking setup with the standard
(perceptron) statistical learning theory and show that grokking is a
consequence of the locality of the teacher model. As an example, we analyse the
cellular automata learning task, numerically determine the critical exponent
and the grokking time distributions and compare them with the prediction of the
proposed grokking model. Finally, we numerically analyse the connection between
structure formation and grokking.

Recently the successful formation of PEO coatings on zinc in a phosphate

various mixtures of ZnO and ZnAl$_2$O$_4$. In frame of the current study, the
properties of the formed coatings including adhesion/cohesion, wear, corrosion
and photocatalytic activity were analysed to identify possible applications.
However, the coatings show internal porosity and a sponge-like structure. Thus
the cohesion within the coating is quite low. Pull-off tests have demonstrated
clear rupture within the PEO layer at strength values as low as 1 MPa. The
photocatalytic activity is limited, in spite of the formation of a higher
amount of ZnO at shorter treatment times. Interestingly, the composite coatings
of ZnO and higher amounts of ZnAl$_2$O$_4$ spinel showed a higher activity, but
not sufficient for fast and effective catalytic cleaning applications.

combination of density functional theory calculations including an on-site
Coulomb repulsion term (DFT+$U$) and Boltzmann transport theory within the
constant relaxation time approximation. For pristine SLs, we find the
stabilization of an antiferromagnetic charge-disproportionated (AFM-CD)
($d^{8}${$\underline L$}$^{2}$)$_{S=0}$($d^{8}$)$_{S=1}$ phase, irrespective of
strain. At $\delta$ = 0.125 and 0.25, the interplay of confinement and strain
triggers a varying degree of charge disproportionation, resulting in
ferrimagnetic insulators. However at $\delta$ = 0.5, an insulating phase
emerges with alternating stripes of Ni$^{2+}$ (high-spin) and Ni$^{2+}$
(low-spin) and oxygen vacancies ordered along the [110] direction (S-AFM),
resulting in a robust $n$-type in-plane power factor of 12.4~$\mu$W/K$^2$ cm
(assuming relaxation time $\tau = 4$~fs), at 300~K. This demonstrates the fine
tunability of electronic, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties by oxygen

Despite its ubiquity in quantum computation and quantum information, a
universally applicable definition of quantum entanglement remains elusive. The
challenge is further accentuated when entanglement is associated with other key
themes, e.g., quantum interference and quantum statistics. Here, we introduce
two novel motifs that characterize the interplay of entanglement and quantum
statistics: an 'entanglement pointer' and a 'statistics-induced entanglement
entropy'. The two provide a quantitative description of the statistics-induced
entanglement: (i) they are finite only in the presence of quantum entanglement
underlined by quantum statistics; (ii) their explicit form depends on the
quantum statistics of the particles (e.g., fermions, bosons, anyons). We have
experimentally implemented these ideas by employing an electronic
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer fed by two highly diluted electron beams in an
integer quantum Hall platform. Performing measurements of auto-correlation and
cross-correlation of current fluctuations of the scattered beams (following
'collisions'), we quantify the statistics-induced entanglement by
experimentally accessing the entanglement pointer and the statistics-induced
entanglement entropy. Our theoretical and experimental approaches pave the way
to study entanglement in various correlated platforms, e.g., those involving
anyonic Abelian and non-Abelian states.

A method for subsurface visualization and characterization of hidden
subsurface nano-structures based on Scanning Tuneling Microscopy/Spectroscopy
(STM/STS) has been developed. The nano-objects buried under a metal surface up
to several tens of nanometers can be visualized through the metal surface and
characterized with STM without destriying the sample. This non-destructive
method exploits quantum well (QW) states formed by partial electron confinement
between the surface and buried nano-objects. The specificity of STM allows for
nano-objects to be singled out and easily accessed. Then, their shape, size and
burial depth can be determined by analysing the spatial distribution and
oscillatory behavior of the electron density at the surface of the sample. The
proof of concept was demonstrated by fabricating argon nanoclusters embedded
into a single-crystalline Cu matrix. Taking advantage of the specific
electronic band structure Cu and inner electron focusing, we experimentally
demonstrated that noble-gas nanoclusters of several nanometers large buried as
deep as 80 nm can be detected, characterized and imaged. The ultime depth of
this ability is estimated as 110 nm. This approach using QW states paves the
way for an enhanced 3D characterization of nanostructures hidden well below a
metallic surface.

Quantum simulation of quasicrystals in synthetic bosonic matter now paves the

Yet thermal fluctuations in such systems compete with quantum coherence, and
significantly affect the zero-temperature quantum phases. Here we determine the

homogeneous quasicrystal potential. Our results are found using quantum Monte
Carlo simulations. Finite-size scaling is carefully considered and the quantum
phases are systematically distinguished from thermal phases. In particular, we
demonstrate stabilization of a genuine Bose glass phase against the normal
fluid in sizable parameter ranges. Our results for strong interactions are
interpreted using a fermionization picture and experimental relevance is
discussed.

Topological magnons in a one-dimensional (1D) ferromagnetic (FM)
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with anisotropic exchange interactions are
investigated. Apart from the inter-cellular isotropic Heisenberg interaction,
the intercellular anisotropic exchange interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), also can induce the
emergence of the non-trivial phase with two degenerate in-gap edge states
separately localized at the two ends of the 1D chain, while the intracellular
interactions instead unfavors the topological phase. The interplay among them
has synergistic effects on the topological phase transition, very different
from that in the two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnet. These results demonstrate
that the 1D magnons possess rich topological phase diagrams distinctly
different from the electronic version of the SSH model and even the 2D magnons.
Due to the lower dimensional structural characteristics of this 1D topological
magnonic system, the magnonic crystals can be constructed from bottom to top,
which has important potential applications in the design of novel magnonic
devices.

Cubic phonon interactions are now regularly computed from first principles,
and the quartic interactions have begun to receive more attention. Given this
realistic anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian, the classical phonon Green's
function can be precisely measured using molecular dynamics, which can then be
used to rigorously assess the range of validity for self-consistent
diagrammatic approaches in the classical limit. Here we use the bundled
irreducible derivative approach to efficiently and precisely compute the cubic
and quartic phonon interactions of CaF$_2$, systematically obtaining the
vibrational Hamiltonian purely in terms of irreducible derivatives. We assess
the fidelity of various bare and self-consistent diagrammatic approaches to the
phonon Green's function as compared to molecular dynamics. Specific attention
is given to the phonon frequency shifts and linewidths, demonstrating that the
4-phonon bubble diagram has an important contribution to the optical phonon
linewidths beyond $T=500$ K. Moreover, accurate results are obtained even at
$T=900$ K when performing self-consistency using the 4-phonon loop diagram and
evaluating the 3-phonon and 4-phonon bubble diagrams post self-consistency.
This procedure of assessing the classical limit of some set of diagrams using
molecular dynamics should serve as a critical test of perturbative approaches,
reserving comparisons to experiment for judging the quality of the Hamiltonian
itself and not the approximations used to solve it.

We analyze random resistor networks through a study of disordered lattice
Green's functions in arbitrary dimensions. We develop a systematic disorder
perturbation expansion to describe the weak disorder regime of such a system.
We use this formulation to compute ensemble averaged nodal voltages and bond
currents in a hierarchical fashion. We verify the validity of this expansion
with direct numerical simulations of a square lattice with resistances at each
bond chosen from an exponential distribution. Additionally, we construct a
formalism to recursively obtain the exact Green's functions for finitely many
disordered bonds. We provide explicit expressions for lattices with up to four
disordered bonds, which can be used to predict nodal voltage distributions for
arbitrarily large disorder strengths. Finally, we introduce a novel order
parameter that measures the overlap between the bond current and the optimal
path (the path of least resistance), for a given resistance configuration,
which helps to characterize the weak and strong disorder regimes of the system.

Quantum engineering of topological superconductors and of the ensuing
Majorana zero modes might hold the key for realizing a new paradigm for the
implementation of topological quantum computing and topology-based devices.
Magnet-superconductor hybrid (MSH) systems have proven to be experimentally
versatile platforms for the creation of topological superconductivity by
custom-designing the complex structure of their magnetic layer. Here, we
demonstrate that higher order topological superconductivity (HOTSC) can be
realized in two-dimensional MSH systems by using stacked magnetic structures.
We show that the sensitivity of the HOTSC to the particular magnetic stacking
opens an unprecedented ability to tune the system between trivial and
topological phases using atomic manipulation techniques. We propose that the
realization of HOTSC in MSH systems, and in particular the existence of the
characteristic Majorana corner modes, allows for the implementation of a
measurement-based protocols for topological quantum computing.

The electrical control of magnons opens up new ways to transport and process
information for logic devices. In magnetoelectrical multiferroics, the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction directly allow for such a control and,
hence, is of major importance. We determine the origin and the strength of the
(converse) spin current DM interaction in the R3c bulk phase of the
multiferroic BiFeO3 based on density functional theory. Our data supports only
the existence of one DM interaction contribution originating from the spin
current model. By exploring then magnon dispersion in the full Brillouin Zone,
we show that the exchange is isotropic, but the DM interaction and anisotropy
prefer any propagation and any magnetization direction within the full (111)
plane. Our work emphasizes the significance of the asymmetric potential induced
by the spin current over the structural asymmetry induced by the anionic
octahedron in multiferroics such as BiFeO3.

The notion of higher-order topological phases can have interesting
generalizations to systems with subsystem symmetries that exhibit fractonic
dynamics for charged excitations. In this work, we systematically study the
higher-order topological phases protected by a combination of subsystem
symmetries and ordinary global symmetries in two and three-dimensional
interacting boson systems, with some interacting fermionic examples.

We present an experimental technique to generate and measure a temperature
bias in the quantum Hall effect of GaAs/AlGaAs Corbino samples. The bias is
generated by injecting an electrical current at a central resistive heater and
the resulting radial temperature drop is determine by local measurements of the
conductance between internal and external concentric rings. The experimental
results are in agreement with the predictions of numerical simulations of the
heat flow through the substrate. We also compare these results with previous
predictions based on the thermoelectric response of these devices.

Computing phonons from first-principles is typically considered a solved
problem, yet inadequacies in existing techniques continue to yield deficient
results in systems with sensitive phonons. Here we circumvent this issue using
the lone irreducible derivative (LID) and bundled irreducible derivative (BID)
approaches to computing phonons via finite displacements, where the former
optimizes precision via energy derivatives and the latter provides the most
efficient algorithm using force derivatives. A condition number optimized (CNO)
basis for BID is derived which guarantees the minimum amplification of error.
Additionally, a hybrid LID-BID approach is formulated, where select irreducible
derivatives computed using LID replace BID results. We illustrate our approach
on two prototypical systems with sensitive phonons: the shape memory alloy AuZn
and metallic lithium. Comparing our resulting phonons in the aforementioned
crystals to calculations in the literature reveals nontrivial inaccuracies. Our
approaches can be fully automated, making them well suited for both niche
systems of interest and high throughput approaches.

Crystalline graphene heterostructures, namely Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral
trilayer graphene, subject to electric displacement fields, display a rich
confluence of competing orders, resulting in a valley-degenerate,
spin-polarized half-metal at moderate doping, and a spin- and valley-polarized
quarter-metal at low doping. Here we show that the annular Fermi surface of
such a quarter-metal can be susceptible toward the nucleation of a unique spin
and valley polarized superconducting state, accommodating interlayer Cooper
pairs that break the translational symmetry, giving rise to a Kekul\'e or
columnar pair-density-wave. The superconducting ground state produces isolated
Fermi pockets of neutral Majorana fermions, featuring a three-fold rotational
symmetry, resulting in power-law scaling physical observables with temperature
($T$), such as specific heat $C_v \sim T$.
