<h3>Band Gap Tuning of DC Reactively Sputtered ZnON Thin Films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08201" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08201</a>

Zinc oxynitride (ZnO$_x$N$_y$) has recently emerged as a highly promising
band gap-tunable semiconductor material for optoelectronic applications. In
this study, a novel DC reactive sputtering protocol was developed to fabricate
ZnO$_x$N$_y$ films with varying elemental concentrations, by precisely
controlling the working pressure. The band gap was rigorously analyzed using
UV-Visible spectroscopy, which was complemented by EDAX spectroscopy to
determine the variations in the elemental composition. The correlation between
the microstructure and band gap was investigated through the application of
AFM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy, while the Urbach theorem was used to evaluate
the defect states. This study revealed the existence of intermediate structures
formed during the tuning of the band gap, which can have important implications
for future research aimed at developing heterostructures and 2D superlattices
for photonics applications.

<h3>Flow patterns and defect dynamics of active nematics under an electric  field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08355" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08355</a>

<br>
<br>
The effects of an electric field on the flow patterns and defect dynamics of
two-dimensional active nematics is numerically investigated. We found that
field-induced director reorientation causes anisotropic active turbulence
characterized by enhanced flow perpendicular to the electric field. The average
flow speed and its anisotropy are maximized at an intermediate field strength.
Topological defects in the anisotropic active turbulence are localized and show
characteristic dynamics involving two pairs of defects. A laning state is found
at a larger field strength near the transition to the uniformly aligned state.
We obtained periodic oscillations between the laning state and active
turbulence, which resembles an experimental observation of active nematics
subject to anisotropic friction.

We study light-activated quasi-2d gels made of a colloidal network doped with
Janus particles. Following the gel formation, the internal dynamics of the gel
are monitored before, during, and after the light activation. We monitor both
the structure and dynamics, before, during and after the illumination period.
The mobility of the passive particles exhibits a characteristic scale-dependent
response. Immediately following light activation, the gel displays large-scale
reorganization, followed by progressive, short-scale displacements throughout
the activation period. Albeit subtle structural changes (including pore opening
and widening and shortening of strands) the colloidal network remains
connected, and the gel maintains its structural integrity. Once activity is
switched off, the gel keeps the memory of the structure inherited from the
active phase. Remarkably, the motility remains larger than that of the gel,
before the active period. The system has turned into a genuinely different gel,
with frozen dynamics, but with more space for thermal fluctuations. The above
conclusions remain valid long after the activity period.

<br>
<br>
Due to the success achieved by graphene, several 2D carbon-based allotropes
were theoretically predicted and experimentally synthesized. Here, we propose a
new 2D carbon allotrope named Sun-Graphyne (S-GY). We used density functional
theory and reactive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate its
mechanical, structural, electronic, and optical properties. The results showed
that S-GY exhibits good dynamical and thermal stabilities. Its formation energy
and elastic moduli are -8.57 eV/atom and 262.37 GPa, respectively. S-GY is a
semi-metal and presents two Dirac cones in its band structure. This material is
transparent, and its intense optical activity is limited to the infrared
region. Remarkably, the band structure of S-GY remains practically unchanged at
even moderate strain regimes. As far as we know, this is the first 2D carbon
allotrope to exhibit this behaviour.

<h3>Steric engineering of point defects in lead halide perovskites</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08412" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08412</a>

<i>Lucy D. Whalley</i>
<br>
<br>
Due to their high photovoltaic efficiency and low-cost synthesis, lead halide
perovskites have attracted wide interest for application in new solar cell
technologies. The most stable and efficient ABX$_3$ perovskite solar cells
employ mixed A-site cations, however the impact of cation mixing on carrier
trapping and recombination -- key processes that limit photovoltaic performance
-- is not fully understood. Here we analyse non-radiative carrier trapping in
the mixed A-cation hybrid halide perovskite MA$_{1-x}$Cs$_{x}$PbI$_3$. By using
rigorous first-principles simulations combined with techniques initially
developed for organic molecular materials, we show that cation mixing leads to
a hole trapping rate at the iodine interstitial that is seven orders of
magnitude greater than in the single cation system. We demonstrate that the
same defect in the same material can display a wide variety of defect activity
-- from electrically inactive to recombination centre -- and, in doing so,
resolve conflicting reports in the literature. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism in which composition can be used to determine the rate of carrier
trapping; this is achieved by controlling the phase and dynamical response of
the lattice through the steric size of the A-site cations. Our findings
elucidate crucial links between chemical composition, defect activity and
optoelectronic performance, and present a general approach that can help to
rationalise the development of new materials with target defect properties.

<h3>Effective dynamics and fluctuations of a trapped probe moving in a fluid  of active hard discs</h3>

<br>

We study the dynamics of a single trapped probe surrounded by self-propelled
active particles in two dimensions. In the limit of large size separation, we
perform an adiabatic elimination of the small active particles to obtain an
effective Markovian dynamics of the large probe, yielding explicit expressions
for the mobility and diffusion coefficient. To calculate these expressions, we
perform computer simulations employing active Brownian discs and consider two
scenarios: non-interacting bath particles and purely repulsive interactions
modeling volume exclusion. We keep the probe-to-bath size ratio fixed and vary
the propulsion speed of the bath particles. The positional fluctuations of a
trapped probe are accessible in experiments, for which we test the prediction
from the adiabatic elimination. Although the approximations cause a discrepancy
at equilibrium, the overall agreement between predicted and measured probe
fluctuations is very good at larger speeds.

<h3>The absence of mixed valency for Pr in pristine and hole-doped PrNiO$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08460</a>

Infinite-layer nickelates ($R$NiO$_2$) exhibit some distinct differences as
compared to cuprate superconductors, leading to a debate concerning the role of
rare-earth ions ($R$=La, Pr, Nd) in the low-energy many-body physics. Although
rare-earth $4f$ orbitals are typically treated as inert `core' electrons in
studies, this approximation has been questioned. An active participation of
$4f$ states is most likely for PrNiO$_2$ based on an analogy to cuprates where
Pr cuprates differ significantly from other cuprates. Here, we adopt density
functional plus dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) to investigate the role
of Pr $4f$ orbitals and more generally the correlated electronic structure of
PrNiO$_2$ and its hole-doped variant. We find that the Pr $4f$ states are
insulating and show no evidence for either a Kondo resonance or Zhang-Rice
singlet formation as they do not have any hybridization channels near the Fermi
energy. The biggest effects of hole doping are to shift the Pr $5d$ and $4f$
states further away from the Fermi energy while enhancing the Ni $3d$ - O $2p$
hybridization, thus reducing correlation effects as the O $2p$ states get
closer to the Fermi energy. We again find no evidence for either Kondo or
Zhang-Rice physics for the $4f$ states upon hole doping. We conclude by
commenting on implications for other reduced valence nickelates.

<h3>Shear-induced bimodality and stability analysis of chiral spheroidal  swimmers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08483</a>
<br>
<i>Mohammad Reza Shabanniya, Amir Abbasi, Arghavan Partovifard, Ali Naji</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the shear-induced behavior of chiral (circle-swimming) and nonchiral
swimmers in a planar channel subjected to Poiseuille (pressure-driven) flow.
The swimmers are modeled as active Brownian spheroids, self-propelling with a
fixed-magnitude velocity, pointing along their axis of symmetry. We consider
both cases of prolate and oblate swimmers and focus primarily on swimmers that
possess an intrinsic, or active, counterclockwise angular velocity, in addition
to the shear-induced angular velocity they acquire within the channel flow
(Jeffery orbits). The probabilistic results are established using a
Smoluchowski equation within the position orientation phase space that is
solved numerically. We show that the interplay between shear- and
chirality-induced angular velocities, combined with the effects due to particle
self-propulsion and steric particle-wall interactions, lead to an interesting
range of effects, including pinning, off-centered and near-wall accumulation of
swimmers within the channel. This is further accompanied by the linear
stability analysis of swimmers, used to explain the probabilistic results. We
discuss the qualitative differences of probabilistic results that emerge due to
the different regimes of rotational dynamics of swimmers in channel flow,
particularly the shear-trapping/-escaping of prolate/oblate swimmers and the
difference in latitudes of fixed points associated with each swimmer shape. Our
results point to possible mechanisms for flow-driven separation of active
spheroidal particles based on their chirality strength.

<h3>Discrete scale invariant fixed point in a quasiperiodic classical dimer  model</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07879" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07879</a>

We study close-packed dimers on the quasiperiodic Ammann-Beenker (AB) graph,
that was recently shown to have the unusual feature that hard-core dimer
constraints are exactly reproduced at successive discrete length scales. This
observation led to a conjecture that it would be possible to construct an exact
real-space decimation scheme where each iteration preserves both the
quasiperiodic tiling structure and the constraint. Here, we confirm this
conjecture by explicitly constructing the corresponding renormalization group
transformation and show, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, that the
dimer distributions flow to a fixed point with non-zero dimer potentials. We
use the fixed-point Hamiltonian to demonstrate the existence of slowly decaying
dimer correlations. We thus identify a remarkable example of a classical
statistical mechanical model whose properties are controlled by the fixed point
of an exact renormalization group procedure exhibiting discrete scale
invariance but lacking translational and continuous rotational symmetries.

<h3>Complex fixed points of the non-Hermitian Kondo model in a Luttinger  liquid</h3>

Non-Hermitian physics in open quantum many-body systems provides novel
opportunities for discovery of exotic quantum phenomena unexpected in Hermitian
systems. A previous study of the non-Hermitian Kondo problem in ultra-cold
atoms reports reversion of renormalization group flows which violates the
$g$-theorem and produces an unusual quantum phase transition. In this work, we
study the effect of electron-electron interactions by considering the
non-Hermitian Kondo problem in a Luttinger liquid. By performing a perturbative
renormalization group analysis to two-loop order, we find that the interplay
between non-Hermitian Kondo couplings and electron-electron interactions can
produce a pair of complex fixed points. Complex fixed points have often been
discussed in an attempt to understand extremely long correlation length of
Hermitian systems with weakly first-order transitions. Here, we show that
complex fixed points arise naturally and can be physically realized in open
quantum systems. We discuss consequences of the complex fixed points and future
directions.

<h3>A model of $d$-wave superconductivity, antiferromagnetism, and charge  order on the square lattice</h3>

Early studies proposed a connection between cuprate superconductivity and
fractionalized spin liquid states. But the low temperature phase diagram is
dominated by states without fractionalization, with a competition between
superconductivity and charge-ordered states which break translational symmetry.
Our theory uncovers novel features associated with a particular spin-liquid
presumed to underlie the pseudogap metal, and shows that it has multiple
nearly-degenerate instabilities to confinement of fractionalized excitations,
leading to antiferromagnetism, $d$-wave superconductivity, and/or charge order.
Our theory provides routes to resolving a number of open puzzles on the cuprate
phase diagram.
The spin liquid is described by a SU(2) gauge theory of $N_f=2$ massless
fundamental Dirac fermions, has an emergent SO(5)$_f$ global symmetry, and is
presumed to confine at low energies to the N\'eel state. At non-zero doping (or
smaller Hubbard repulsion at half-filling) we argue that confinement occurs via
the Higgs condensation of bosonic chargons carrying fundamental SU(2) gauge
charges moving in $\pi$ flux. At half-filling, the low energy Higgs sector has
$N_b=2$ relativistic bosons with a possible emergent SO(5)$_b$ global symmetry
describing rotations between a $d$-wave superconductor, period-2 charge
stripes, and the time-reversal breaking `$d$-density wave' state. We propose a
deconfined quantum critical point between a confining state which breaks
SO(5)$_f$ and a confining state which breaks SO(5)$_b$. The pattern of symmetry
breaking within both SO(5)s is determined by terms likely irrelevant at the
critical point, which can be chosen to obtain a transition between N\'eel order
and $d$-wave superconductivity. A similar theory applies at non-zero doping and
large $U$, with longer-range couplings of the chargons leading to charge order
with longer periods.

<h3>Tensor network study of the Shastry-Sutherland model with weak  interlayer coupling</h3>

The layered material SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has long been studied because of
its fascinating physics in a magnetic field and under pressure. Many of its
properties are remarkably well described by the Shastry-Sutherland model (SSM)
- a two-dimensional frustrated spin system. However, the extent of the
intermediate plaquette phase discovered in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ under pressure
is significantly smaller than predicted in theory, which is likely due to the
weak interlayer coupling that is present in the material but neglected in the
model. Using state-of-the-art tensor network methods we study the SSM with a
weak interlayer coupling and show that the intermediate plaquette phase is
destabilized already at a smaller value around $J''/J\sim0.04-0.05$ than
previously predicted from series expansion. Based on our phase diagram we
estimate the effective interlayer coupling in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ to be around
$J''/J\sim0.026$ at ambient pressure.

<h3>Isometric tensor network representations of two-dimensional thermal  states</h3>

Tensor networks provide a useful tool to describe low-dimensional complex
many-body systems. Finding efficient algorithms to use these methods for finite
temperature simulations in two dimensions is a continuing challenge. Here, we
use the class of recently introduced isometric tensor network states (isoTNS),
which can also be directly realized with unitary gates on a quantum computer.
We utilize a purification ansatz to efficiently represent thermal states of the
transverse field Ising model. By performing an imaginary time evolution
starting from infinite temperature, we find that this approach offers a new way
with low computational complexity to represent states at finite temperatures.

<h3>Momentum-independent magnetic excitation continuum in the honeycomb  iridate H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$</h3>

<br>
<br>
In the search for realizations of Quantum Spin Liquids (QSL), it is essential
to understand the interplay between inherent disorder and the correlated
fluctuating spin ground state. H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ is regarded as a spin liquid
proximate to the Kitaev-limit (KQSL) in which H zero-point motion and stacking
faults are known to be present. Bond disorder has been invoked to account for
the existence of unexpected low-energy spin excitations. Controversy remains
about the nature of the underlying correlated state and if any KQSL physics
survives. Here, we use resonant X-ray spectroscopies to map the collective
excitations in H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ and characterize its magnetic state. We
uncover a broad bandwidth and momentum-independent continuum of magnetic
excitations at low temperatures that are distinct from the paramagnetic state.
The center energy and high-energy tail of the continuum are consistent with
expectations for dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev interactions between dynamically
fluctuating spins. The absence of a momentum dependence to these excitations
indicates a broken translational invariance. Our data support an interpretation
of H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ as a disordered topological spin liquid in close
proximity to bond-disordered versions of the KQSL. Our results shed light on
how random disorder affects topological magnetic states and have implications
for future experimental and theoretical works toward realizing the Kitaev model
in condensed matter systems

<h3>Dimensionality dependent electronic structure of the exfoliated van der  Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) was used to measure the local
electronic structure in few-layer exfoliated flakes of the van der Waals
antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. The resulting spectra show a systematic softening and
broadening of $NiS_6$ multiplet excitations with decreasing layer count from
the bulk to three atomic layers (3L). These trends are driven by a decrease in
the transition metal-ligand and ligand-ligand hopping integrals, and in the
charge-transfer energy: $\Delta$ = 0.60 eV in the bulk and 0.22 eV in 3L
NiPS$_3$. Relevant intralayer magnetic exchange integrals computed from the
electronic parameters exhibit a systematic decrease in the average interaction
strength with thickness and place 2D NiPS$_3$ close to the phase boundary
between stripy and spiral antiferromagnetic order, which may explain the
apparent vanishing of long-range order in the 2D limit. This study explicitly
demonstrates the influence of $inter$layer electronic interactions on
$intra$layer ones in insulating magnets. As a consequence, the magnetic
Hamiltonian in few-layer insulating magnets can be significantly different from
that in the bulk.

<br>
<br>
We investigate magnetization dynamics of Mn$_{2}$Au/Py (Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$)
thin film bilayers using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and Brillouin
light scattering spectroscopy. Our bilayers exhibit two resonant modes with
zero-field frequencies up to almost 40 GHz, far above the single-layer Py FMR.
Our model calculations attribute these modes to the coupling of the Py FMR and
the two antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) modes of Mn2Au. The
coupling-strength is in the order of 1.6 T$\cdot$nm at room temperature for
nm-thick Py. Our model reveals the dependence of the hybrid modes on the AFMR
frequencies and interfacial coupling as well as the evanescent character of the
spin waves that extend across the Mn$_{2}$Au/Py interface

<h3>Abundant lattice instability in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07922" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07922</a>

<br>
<br>
Kagome materials are emerging platforms for studying charge and spin orders.
In this work, we have revealed a rich lattice instability in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ by calculations. Beyond verifying the $\sqrt3 \times
\sqrt3 \times 3$ charge density wave (CDW) order observed by the recent
experiment, we further identified three more possible CDW structures, i,e.,
$\sqrt3 \times \sqrt3 \times 2$ CDW with $P6/mmm$ symmetry, $2 \times 2 \times
2$ CDW with $Immm$ symmetry, and $2 \times 2 \times 2$ CDW with $P6/mmm$
symmetry. The former two are more energetically favored than the $\sqrt3 \times
\sqrt3 \times 3$ phase, while the third one is comparable in energy. These CDW
structures involve mainly the out-of-plane movements of Sc and Sn atoms, while
V atoms constituting the kagome net are almost unchanged. We attribute the
lattice instability to the small Sc atomic radius. In contrast, such an
instability disappears in its sister compounds $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$ is Y, or a
rare-earth element) where $R$ has a larger radius. Our work indicates that
ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ might exhibit varied CDW phases in different experimental
conditions and provides insights to explore rich charge orders in kagome
materials.

<h3>Less is different: why sparse networks with inhibition differ from  complete graphs</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07927" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07927</a>
<br>
<i>Gustavo Menesse, Osame Kinouchi</i>
<br>
<br>
In neuronal systems, inhibition contributes to stabilizing dynamics and
regulating pattern formation. Through developing mean field theories of
neuronal models, using complete graph networks, inhibition is commonly viewed
as one control parameter of the system, promoting an absorbing phase
transition. Here, we show that for sparse networks, inhibition weight is not a
control parameter of the transition. We present analytical and simulation
results using stochastic integrate and fire neurons. We also give a simple
explanation about why the inhibition role depends on topology, even when the
topology has dimensionality greater than the critical one. Thus, the generality
of neuronal systems mean-field results presented in the literature should be
reanalyzed with care.

<h3>Effect of dynamical screening in the Bethe-Salpeter framework: Excitons  in crystalline naphthalene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07948" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07948</a>
<br>
<i>Xiao Zhang, Joshua A. Leveillee, André Schleife</i>
<br>
<br>
Solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the optical polarization
functions is a first principles means to model optical properties of materials
including excitonic effects. One almost ubiquitously used approximation
neglects the frequency dependence of the screened electron-hole interaction.
This is commonly justified by the large difference in magnitude of electronic
plasma frequency and exciton binding energy. We incorporated dynamical effects
into the screening of the electron-hole interaction in the BSE using two
different approximations as well as exact diagonalization of the exciton
Hamiltonian. We compare these approaches for a naphthalene organic crystal, for
which the difference between exciton binding energy and plasma frequency is
only about a factor of ten. Our results show that in this case, corrections due
to dynamical screening are about 15\,\% of the exciton binding energy. We
analyze the effect of screening dynamics on optical absorption across the
visible spectral range and use our data to establish an \emph{effective}
screening model as a computationally efficient approach to approximate
dynamical effects in complex materials in the future.

<h3>Second Quantization: Gating a Quantum Dot Through the Sequential Removal  of Single Electrons from a Nanoscale Floating Gate</h3>

We use the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to charge floating
metallic gates defined on the surface of a Si/SiGe heterostructure. The AFM tip
serves as an ideal and movable cryogenic switch, allowing us to bias a floating
gate to a specific voltage and then lock the charge on the gate by withdrawing
the tip. Biasing with an AFM tip allows us to reduce the size of a quantum dot
floating gate electrode down to $\sim100~\mathrm{nm}$. Measurements of the
conductance through a quantum dot formed beneath the floating gate indicate
that its charge changes in discrete steps. From the statistics of the
single-electron leakage events, we determine the floating gate leakage
resistance $R \sim 10^{19}~ \mathrm{Ohm}$ - a value immeasurable by
conventional means.

Compositionally complex alloys hold the promise of simultaneously attaining
superior combinations of properties such as corrosion resistance,
light-weighting, and strength. Achieving this goal is a challenge due in part
to a large number of possible compositions and structures in the vast alloy
design space. High throughput methods offer a path forward, but a strong
connection between the synthesis of a given composition and structure with its
properties has not been fully realized to date. Here we present the rapid
identification of light weight highly corrosion-resistant alloys based on
combinations of Al and Cr in a Cantor-like base alloy (Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni).
Previously unstudied alloy stoichiometries were identified using a combination
of high throughput experimental screening coupled with key metallurgical and
electrochemical corrosion tests, identifying alloys with excellent passivation
behavior. Importantly, the electrochemical impedance modulus of the
exposure-modified, air-formed film at the corrosion potential was found as an
accurate non-destructive predictor of corrosion and passivation
characteristics. Multi-element EXAFS analyses connected more ordered type
chemical short range order in the Ni-Al 1st nn shell to poorer corrosion. This
report underscores the utility of high throughput exploration of
compositionally complex alloys for the identification and rapid screening of
vast stoichiometric space.

We show that the spectra of Wishart matrices built from magnetization time
series can describe the phase transitions and the critical phenomena of the
Potts model with a different number of states. We can statistically determine
the transition points, independent of their order, by studying the density of
the eigenvalues and corresponding fluctuations. In some way, we establish a
relationship between the actual thermodynamics with the spectral thermodynamics
described by the eigenvalues. The histogram of correlations between time series
interestingly supports our results. In addition, we present an analogy to the
study of the spectral properties of the Potts model, considering matrices
correlated artificially. For such matrices, the eigenvalues are distributed in
two groups that present a gap depending on such correlation.

<br>
<br>
Topological spin textures such as magnetic skyrmions hold considerable
promise as robust, nanometre-scale, mobile bits for sustainable computing. A
longstanding roadblock to unleashing their potential is the absence of a device
enabling deterministic electrical readout of individual spin textures. Here we
present the wafer-scale realization of a nanoscale chiral magnetic tunnel
junction (MTJ) hosting a single, ambient skyrmion. Using a suite of electrical
and multi-modal imaging techniques, we show that the MTJ nucleates skyrmions of
fixed polarity, whose large readout signal - 20-70% relative to uniform states
- corresponds directly to skyrmion size. Further, the MTJ exploits
complementary mechanisms to stabilize distinctly sized skyrmions at zero field,
thereby realizing three nonvolatile electrical states. Crucially, it can write
and delete skyrmions using current densities 1,000 times lower than
state-of-the-art. These results provide a platform to incorporate readout and
manipulation of skyrmionic bits across myriad device architectures, and a
springboard to harness chiral spin textures for multi-bit memory and
unconventional computing.

<br>
<br>
The micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS) force and acceleration sensor
utilizing the graphene-induced non-radiative transition was investigated. The
graphene-induced non-radiative transition is very sensitive to the distance,
and the deflection of the graphene ribbon is highly susceptive to applied force
or acceleration. Thus, a high-sensitivity MEMS sensor can be achieved with
detecting the graphene ribbon's deflection of 1 nm, the force of 0.1 pN, and
the acceleration of 0.1 mg. The MEMS sensor, with a size of only tens of
microns, can be charged by light irradiation without connecting power sources.
In addition, it allows long-distance detection, i.e., wireless transmitter
circuit can be omitted. Therefore, it will have significant application
prospects in the fields of micro-smart devices, wearable devices, biomedical
systems, and so on.

<i>Biao Huang</i>
<br>
<br>
We reconstruct the spectral pairing (SP) theories to allow for analytical
descriptions of non-prethermal clean discrete time crystals (DTCs). It is shown
that the strong Ising interactions and drivings alone stabilize a class of
``cat scar" eigenstates exhibiting counter-intuitive Fock space localization
and long-range correlations in mesoscopic clean systems, which resemble the
glassy cat eigenstates in many-body localized DTCs. In particular, we introduce
a symmetry indicator method to enumerate cat scars, with which a set of
unexpected inhomogeneous scar patterns are identified in addition to the
ferromagnetic scars found before. These scars enforce clean DTCs with rigid
inhomogeneous patterns, offering a viable way to prove mesoscopic eigenstate
orders experimentally. Further, we provide three analytical scaling relations
to characterize the amplitudes, Fock space localization, and lifetime for clean
DTCs associated with cat scars. Symmetry indicators and scalings relations
constitute an analytical scheme long-sought-after to systematically predict the
behaviors for clean DTCs.

<br>
<br>
The ThIrSi superconductor, with $T_c = 6.5$ K, is expected to show unusual
features in view of its noncentrosymmetric structure and the presence of heavy
elements featuring a sizable spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report a
comprehensive study of its electronic properties by means of local-probe
techniques: muon-spin rotation and relaxation ({\textmu}SR) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). Both the superfluid density $\rho_\mathrm{sc}(T)$
(determined via transverse-field {\textmu}SR) and the spin-lattice relaxation
rate $T_1^{-1}(T)$ (determined via NMR) suggest a nodeless superconductivity.
Furthermore, the absence of spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_c$, as evinced
from zero-field {\textmu}SR measurements, indicates a preserved time-reversal
symmetry in the superconducting state of ThIrSi. Temperature-dependent upper
critical fields as well as field-dependent superconducting muon-spin
relaxations suggest the presence of multiple superconducting gaps in ThIrSi.

EPW is an open-source software for $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of
electron-phonon interactions and related materials properties. The code
combines density functional perturbation theory and maximally-localized Wannier
functions to efficiently compute electron-phonon coupling matrix elements on
ultra-fine Brillouin zone grids. This data is employed for predictive
calculations of temperature-dependent properties and phonon-assisted quantum
processes in bulk solids and low-dimensional materials. Here, we report on
significant new developments in the code that occurred during the period
2016-2022, namely: a transport module for the calculation of charge carrier
mobility and conductivity under electric and magnetic fields within the
$\textit{ab initio}$ Boltzmann transport equation; a superconductivity module
for the calculation of critical temperature and gap structure in
phonon-mediated superconductors within the $\textit{ab initio}$ anisotropic
multi-band Eliashberg theory; an optics module for calculations of
phonon-assisted indirect transitions; a module for the calculation of small and
large polarons without supercells using the $\textit{ab initio}$ polaron
equations; and a module for calculating electron-phonon couplings, band
structure renormalization, and temperature-dependent optical spectra using the
special displacement method. For each capability, we outline the methodology
and implementation, and provide example calculations. We describe recent code
refactoring to prepare EPW for exascale architectures, we discuss efficient
parallelization strategies, and report on extreme parallel scaling tests.

Hanle magnetoresistance (HMR) is a type of magnetoresistance where interplay
of the spin Hall effect, Hanle-type spin precession, and spin-dependent
scattering at the top/bottom surfaces in a heavy metal controls the effect. In
this study, we modulate HMR in ultrathin Pt by ionic gating, where the surface
Rashba field created by a strong electric field at the interface between the
ionic gate and Pt plays the dominant role in the modulation. This finding can
facilitate investigations of gate-tunable, spin-related effects and fabrication
of spin devices.

High-Entropy Materials are composed of multiple elements on comparatively
simpler lattices. Due to the multicomponent nature of such materials, the
atomic scale sampling is computationally expensive due to the combinatorial
complexity. We propose a genetic algorithm based methodology for sampling such
complex chemically-disordered materials. Genetic Algorithm based Atomistic
Sampling Protocol (GAASP) variants can generate low and well as high-energy
structures. GAASP low-energy variant in conjugation with metropolis criteria
avoids the premature convergence as well as ensures the detailed balance

thermodynamic predictions as well as diverse structures can be generated for

<h3>Nonlinear photocurrents from radio to infrared region in the WTe$_2$  monolayer: A quantum kinetics study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08103" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08103</a>
<br>
<i>Yuan Liu, Zhen-Gang Zhu, Gang Su</i>
<br>
<br>
Second-order nonlinear photocurrents, which refer to DC current [i.e.,
photogalvanic effect (PGE)] and second harmonic current [i.e., second harmonic
generation (SHG)] induced by light, are important physical phenomena in
nonlinear optics. The PGE (SHG) related to linearly and circularly polarized
light are called the linear and circular PGE (LPGE and CPGE) [linear and
circular SHG (LSHG and CSHG)], respectively. In this work, we use the quantum
kinetics under relaxation time approximation to study the dependence of
second-order nonlinear photocurrents on Fermi level and frequency under
different out-of-plane electric fields in WTe$_2$ monolayer from radio to
infrared region. We find that the maximum frequency at which the Berry
curvature dipole mechanism for the nonlinear Hall effect plays a major role is
about 1 THz. In radio and microwave regions, two large peaks of nonlinear
conductivities occur when the Fermi level is equal to the energy corresponding
to gap-opening points. In terms of frequency, in radio region, LPGE and SHG
conductivities maintain a large constant while the CPGE conductivity
disappears. In microwave region, LPGE and SHG start to decrease with increasing
frequency while the CPGE is large. In 125-300 THz region and in y direction,
the presence of DC current without the disturbance of second harmonic current
under circularly polarized light may be useful for fabricating new
optoelectronic devices. Moreover, we illustrate that when calculating the
nonlinear photocurrents of practical materials, the theories in the clean limit
fail and it is necessary to use a theory that considers scattering effects. We
also point out that for materials with femtosecond-scale relaxation times and
complex energy band structures, the quantum kinetics is more accurate than the
semi-classical Boltzmann equation method. Besides, phenomenological expressions
of PGE and SHG are provided.

For the first time in the world behavioral functions of laboratory mammals
exposed to silver nanoparticles were studied with the regard to age. Silver
nanoparticles coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone with the size of 8.7 nm were
used in the present research as a potential xcenobiotic. Elder mice adapted to
the xcenobiotic better than younger animals. Younger animals demonstrated more
drastic anxiety than the elder ones. Thus, it is concluded that adaptive
homeostasis non-linearly changes with the age. Presumably, it may improve
during the prime of life and start to decline just after certain stage.

<h3>Synthesis and physical properties of (Pb0.5M0.5)(Sr,La)2CuOz (z~5; M =  Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn)</h3>

<br>
(Pb0.5Cu0.5)(Sr0.5La0.5)2CuOz (abbreviated as (Pb,Cu)-"1-2-0-1") with
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 25 K is a member (n = 1) of one
of the homologous series of cuprate superconductors,
(Pb4+,Cu2+)(Sr2+,Ln3+)2(Y3+,Ca2+)n-1Cu2+nO2-2n+3 (n = 1-4; Ln: lanthanoid
elements). For the (Pb,Cu)-"1-2-0-1", substitution effects of 3d transition
metal elements M (M = Fe, Co, and Zn) for the Cu site in the (Pb,Cu)-O
charge-reservoir layer (labelled as Cu(1)) are systematically investigated.
Because Fe, Co and Ni ions exist as divalent or trivalent in ionic crystals,
the Sr2+/La3+ ratio in the (Sr,Ln) site is adjusted to satisfy charge
neutrality, assuming that they are in a trivalent state. This results in the
successful synthesis of new materials with nominal compositions of
(Pb0.5M0.5)(Sr0.75La0.25)2CuOz (M = Fe and Co). This observation suggests that
Fe and Co are trivalent in "1-2-0-1". For M = Zn, the nominal composition of
(Pb0.5Zn0.5)(Sr0.5La0.5)2CuOz was found to yield a nearly single "1-2-0-1"
phase. Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity and magnetization were
measured, and superconductivity was confirmed only for the case of M = Zn with
a Tc of 19.7 K. For these three materials, the distribution of Fe, Co and Zn
between Cu(1) and another Cu site in the Cu-O2 plane labelled as Cu(2) was
investigated employing transmission electron microscopy, which showed that Fe,
Co, and Zn occupy both the Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites.

The emergence of new nanoporous materials, based e.g. on 2D materials, offers
new avenues for water filtration and energy. There is accordingly a need to
investigate the molecular mechanisms at the root of the advanced performances
of these systems in terms of nanofluidic and ionic transport. In this work, we
introduce a novel unified methodology for Non-Equilibrium classical Molecular
Dynamic simulations (NEMD), allowing to apply likewise pressure, chemical
potential and voltage drops across nanoporous membranes and quantifying the
resulting observables characterizing confined liquid transport under such
external stimuli. We apply the NEMD methodology to study a new type of
synthetic Carbon NanoMembranes (CNM), which have recently shown outstanding
performances for desalination, keeping high water permeability while
maintaining full salt rejection. The high water permeance of CNM, as measured
experimentally, is shown to originate in prominent entrance effects associated
with negligible friction inside the nanopore. Beyond, our methodology allows to
fully calculate the symmetric transport matrix and the cross-phenomena such as
electro-osmosis, diffusio-osmosis, streaming currents, etc. In particular, we
predict a large diffusio-osmotic current across the CNM pore under
concentration gradient, despite the absence of surface charges. This suggests
that CNMs are outstanding candidates as alternative, scalable membranes for
osmotic energy harvesting.

The nonanalyticity of the Loschmidt echo is termed as the dynamical quantum
phase transitions. It extends the notion of quantum criticality to a
nonequilibrium scenario, corresponding to the singular behaviour of the
Loschmidt echo at critical times in quantum quenched systems. Here, we
establish a new paradigm of dynamical phase transitions driven by a sudden
change in the internal spatial correlations of the disorder potential in a
low-dimensional disordered system. The Loschmidt echo characterizes the quantum
quench dynamics and shows a distinctly different behaviour for different
correlation exponents in the time scale. Our results indicate the existence of
anomalous dynamical phase transitions triggered by the spatial correlations of
the random potential. The physical origin of the anomalous transitions is the
overlap between two distinctly different extended states. Furthermore, the
quench dynamics show a clear signature of the delocalization phase transition
in the correlated Anderson model.

Hybrid density functional calculation is indispensable to accurate
description of electronic structure, whereas the formidable computational cost
restricts its broad application. Here we develop a deep equivariant neural
network method (named DeepH-hybrid) to learn the hybrid-functional Hamiltonian
from self-consistent field calculations of small structures, and apply the
trained neural networks for efficient electronic-structure calculation by
passing the self-consistent iterations. The method is systematically checked to
show high efficiency and accuracy, making the study of large-scale materials
with hybrid-functional accuracy feasible. As an important application, the
DeepH-hybrid method is applied to study large-supercell Moir\'{e} twisted
materials, offering the first case study on how the inclusion of exact exchange
affects flat bands in the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.

The viscous flow of polymer chains in dense melts is dominated by topological
constraints whenever the single chain contour length, N, becomes larger than
the characteristic scale Ne, defining comprehensively the macroscopic
rheological properties of the highly entangled polymer systems. Even though the
latter are naturally connected to the presence of hard constraints like knots
and links within the polymer chains, the difficulty of integrating the rigorous
language of mathematical topology with the physics of polymer melts has limited
somehow a genuine topological approach to the problem of classifying these
constraints and to how they are related to the rheological entanglements. In
this work, we tackle this problem by studying the occurrence of knots and links
in lattice melts of randomly knotted and randomly concatenated ring polymers of
various bending stiffness. Specifically, by introducing an algorithm which
shrinks the chains to their minimal shapes which do not violate topological
constraints and by analyzing those in terms of suitable topological invariants,
we provide a detailed characterization of the topological properties at the
intra-chain level (knots) and of links between pairs and triplets of distinct
chains. Then, by employing the Z1-algorithm on the minimal conformations in
order to extract the entanglement length $N_e$, we show that the ratio $N/N_e$,
the number of entanglements per chain, can be remarkably well reconstructed in
terms of 2-chain links solely.

Degeneracy points of parameter-dependent Hermitian matrices play a
fundamental role in quantum physics, as illustrated by the concept of Berry
phase in quantum dynamics, the Weyl semimetals in condensed-matter physics, and
the robust ground-state degeneracies in topologically ordered quantum systems.
Here, we construct simple ball-and-spring mechanical systems, whose
eigenfrequency degeneracies mimic the behaviour of degeneracy points of
electronic band structures. These classical-mechanical arrangements can be
viewed as de-quantized versions of Weyl Josephson circuits, i.e.,
superconducting nanostructures proposed recently to mimic band structure
effects of Weyl semimetals. In the mechanical setups we study, we identify
degeneracy patterns beyond simple Weyl points, including the chirality flip
effect and a quadratic degeneracy point. Our theoretical work is a step toward
simple and illustrative table-top experiments exploring topological and
differential geometrical aspects of physics.

It is rarely reported that collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals can have

whose N\'eel temperatures are above room temperature, have very large AHE with
anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) -100 $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and
$-54\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$, respectively. We further complete the symmetry
resquirements for realizing the AHE in collinear antiferromagnetism.

<br>
<br>
Trions are charged excitons that form upon optical or electrical excitation
of low-dimensional semiconductors in the presence of charge carriers (holes or
electrons). Trion emission from semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) occurs in the near-infrared and at lower energies compared to the
respective exciton. It can be used as an indicator for the presence of excess
charge carriers in SWCNT samples and devices. Both excitons and trions are
highly sensitive to the surrounding dielectric medium of the nanotubes, having
an impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, the influence
of different dielectric materials on exciton and trion emission from
electrostatically doped networks of polymer-sorted (6,5) SWCNTs in top-gate
field-effect transistors is investigated. The observed differences of trion and
exciton emission energies and intensities for hole and electron accumulation
cannot be explained with the polarizability or screening characteristics of the
different dielectric materials, but they show a clear dependence on the charge
trapping properties of the dielectrics. Charge localization (trapping of holes
or electrons by the dielectric) reduces exciton quenching, emission blue-shift
and trion formation. Based on the observed carrier type and dielectric material
dependent variations, the ratio of trion to exciton emission and the exciton
blue-shift are not suitable as quantitative metrics for doping levels of carbon
nanotubes.

Using the Single site Gutzwiller method, we study the ground state properties
of an interexchange symmetric multi-component (two- and three-) bosonic mixture
and generalize these results to a $n$-component ($n=2,3,4,\cdots$) system. We
compute the phase diagram, the Entanglement Entropy, and the ground state
spectral decomposition. Three phases namely the $n$-component Superfluid state
(nSF), the $n$-component Mott insulator state (nMI), and the
Super-counter-fluid state (SCF) are observed. Interestingly, we find that there
are $n-1$ SCF lobes to separate the two neighboring nMI lobes in the phase
diagram. More importantly, we reveal that the SCF phase is maximally entangled
compared to the other two phases, and the Entanglement Entropy is derived
analytically for the SCF phase. In addition, the demixing effect for this
$n$-component mixture is also discussed and the demixed state is formed once
the interspecies interaction strength is larger than the intraspecies
interaction strength.

We analyze F\"urth's 1933 classical uncertainty relations in the modern
language of stochastic differential equations. Our interest is motivated by
applications to non-equilibrium classical statistical mechanics. We show that
F\"urth's uncertainty relations are a property enjoyed by martingales under the
measure of a diffusion process. This result implies a lower bound on
fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in
stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an
inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic
energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance
between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our
analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof
Gaw\c{e}dzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition
described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic
Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition.
Finally, we illustrate how F\"urth's relations admit a straightforward
extension to piecewise deterministic processes. We thus show that the results
in the paper concern properties enjoyed by general Markov processes.

All two-dimensional hard regular polygons have stable crystalline structures
above a finite phase-transition density, and adding short-range interactions is
believed not to qualitatively change their thermal stabilities. By molecular
dynamics simulation, however, we find that adding a short-range Lennard-Jones
interaction on each vertex of the hard regular triangle leads to ground-state
degeneracy of the triangular system due to the fact that the unit cell of the
crystal formed by a dimer has two isotopic structures with identical potential
energies, which induces spontaneous crystalline instability and allows the
system to be in the glassy state at any finite temperatures before liquidizing.
At a fixed finite temperature, the initial crystalline structure eventually
evolves to the glassy state spontaneously through a down-hill process after it
comes over a single energy barrier. This mechanism is further verified by the
observation that forbidding one of the two isotopic structures of the unit cell
extremely heightens the energy barrier.

Generative Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNN) have recently demonstrated
exceptional results in image and language generation tasks, contributing to the
growing popularity of generative models in both scientific and commercial
applications. This work presents a physical interpretation of the ARNNs by
reformulating the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting systems
into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and
biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian's couplings and
external fields, featuring widely used structures like the residual connections
and a recurrent architecture with clear physical meanings. However, the
exponential growth, with system size, of the number of parameters of the hidden
layers makes its direct application unfeasible. Nevertheless, its
architecture's explicit formulation allows using statistical physics techniques
to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. As examples, new effective ARNN
architectures are derived from two well-known mean-field systems, the
Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, showing superior performances
in approximating the Boltzmann distributions of the corresponding physics model
than other commonly used ARNNs architectures. The connection established
between the physics of the system and the ARNN architecture provides a way to
derive new neural network architectures for different interacting systems and
interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.

By solving the Liouville equation, third-order nonlinear terms is found via
iterative density matrix. Regarding the improved modeling, all frequency range
is taken instead of weak absorptive limit. Considered process can be compared
with saturation fitting for heavy-hole excitons in the InAs quantum well.

<h3>Doping asymmetry in the three-band Hamiltonian for cuprate ladders:  failure of the standard model of superconductivity in cuprates</h3>

The relevance of the single-band two-dimensional Hubbard model to
superconductivity in the doped cuprates has recently been questioned, based on
Density matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) computations on extended t-J models
that found superconductivity over unrealistically broad doping region upon
electron-doping, yet complete absence of superconductivity for hole-doping. We
report very similar results from DMRG calculations on Cu$_2$O$_3$ two-leg
ladder within the parent three-band correlated-electron Hamiltonian. The strong
asymmetry found in our calculations are in contradiction to the deep and
profound symmetry between electron- and hole-doped cuprate superconductors,
apart from their critical temperatures, that has been found from recent
experiments.

<h3>Density Matrix Renormalization Group study of superconducting pairing  near the quarter-filled Wigner crystal</h3>

Charge ordering is often found in the phase diagram of unconventional
superconductors in close proximity to the superconducting state. This has led
to the suggestion that fluctuations of charge order can mediate superconducting
pairing. While several mechanisms can lead to charge order, one common
mechanism is the long-range Coulomb interaction, resulting in a Wigner crystal
charge ordered state. We investigate using exact diagonalization and the
density matrix renormalization group the properties of superconducting
pair-pair correlations near a Wigner crystal as a function of $V$, the nearest
neighbor Coulomb interaction. We consider several different lattice boundary
conditions for an electron density of 0.5 per site, the quarter-filled band.
Our results show that the strength of pairing decreases with $V$ and remains
weaker than the tendency of pairing for non-interacting electrons.

<h3>Dark exciton energy splitting in monolayer WSe2: insights from  time-dependent density-functional theory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08375" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08375</a>
<br>
<i>Jia Shi, Volodymyr Turkowski, Duy Le, Talat S. Rahman</i>
<br>
<br>
We present here a formalism based on time-dependent density-functional theory
(TDDFT) to describe characteristics of both intra- and inter-valley excitons in
semiconductors, the latter of which had remained a challenge. Through the usage
of an appropriate exchange-correlation kernel (nanoquanta), we trace the energy
difference between the intra- and inter-valley dark excitons in monolayer (1L)
WSe2 to the domination of the exchange part in the exchange-correlation
energies of these states. Furthermore, our calculated transition contribution
maps establish the momentum resolved weights of the electron-hole excitations
in both bright and dark excitons thereby providing a comprehensive
understanding of excitonic properties of 1L WSe2. We find that the states
consist of hybridized excitations around the corresponding valleys which leads
to brightening of the dark excitons, i.e., significantly decreasing their
lifetime which is reflected in the PL spectrum. Using many-body perturbation
theory, we calculate the phonon contribution to the energy bandgap and the
linewidths of the excited electrons, holes and (bright) exciton to find that as
the temperature increases the bandgap significantly decreases, while the
linewidths increase. Our work paves for describing the ultrafast charge
dynamics of transition metal dichalcogenide within an ab initio framework.

In the field of molecular electronics, particularly in quantum transport
studies, the orientation of molecules plays a crucial role. This orientation,
with respect to the electrodes, can be defined through the cavity of
ring-shaped monocyclic hydrocarbon molecules. In this manuscript, we unveil the
geometrical conformation of these molecules when they are trapped between two
atomically sharp electrodes through a combination of dynamic simulations,
electronic transport calculations based on density functional theory, and break
junction experiments under room conditions. Moreover, we present a novel
criterion for determining the molecular orientation of benzene, toluene,
(aromatic) and cyclohexane (aliphatic) solvents. Our findings for the
identification of the molecular orientations on gold metal nanocontacts and
their associated transport properties, can improve the understanding of
molecular electronics using more complex cyclic hydrocarbons.

<h3>Polarons in two-dimensional atomic crystals</h3>

The polaron is the archetypal example of a quasiparticle emerging from the
interaction between fermionic and bosonic fields in quantum field theory. In
crystalline solids, polarons are formed when electrons and holes become dressed
by the quanta of lattice vibrations. While experimental signatures of polarons
in bulk three-dimensional materials abound, only rarely have polarons been
observed in two-dimensional atomic crystals. Here, we shed light on this
asymmetry by developing a quantitative ab initio theory of polarons in
atomically-thin crystals. Using this conceptual framework, we unravel the
real-space structure of the recently-observed hole polaron in hexagonal boron
nitride, we discover an unexpected critical condition for the existence of
polarons in two-dimensional crystals, and we establish the key materials
descriptors and the universal laws that underpin polaron physics in two
dimensions.

Metallic graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) represent a critical component in the
toolbox of low-dimensional functional materials technolo-gy serving as 1D
interconnects capable of both electronic and quantum information transport. The
structural constraints imposed by on-surface bottom-up GNR synthesis protocols
along with the limited control over orientation and sequence of asymmetric
monomer building blocks during the radical step-growth polymerization has
plagued the design and assembly of metallic GNRs. Here we report the
regioregular synthesis of GNRs hosting robust metallic states by embedding a
symmetric zero-mode superlattice along the backbone of a GNR. Tight-binding
electronic structure models predict a strong nearest-neighbor electron hopping
interaction between adjacent zero-mode states resulting in a dispersive
metallic band. First principles DFT-LDA calculations confirm this prediction
and the robust, metallic zero-mode band of olympicene GNRs (oGNRs) is
experimentally corroborated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

<h3>Overlap renormalization group transformations for disordered systems</h3>

We establish a renormalization group approach which is implemented on the
degrees of freedom defined by the overlap of two replicas to determine the
critical fixed point and to extract four critical exponents for the phase
transition of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. In addition, we
couple the overlap order parameter to a fictitious field and introduce it
within the two-replica Hamiltonian of the system to study its explicit
symmetry-breaking with the renormalization group. Overlap transformations do
not require a renormalization of the random couplings of a system to extract
the critical exponents associated with the relevant variables of the
renormalization group. We conclude by discussing the applicability of such
transformations in the study of any phase transition which is fully
characterized by an overlap order parameter.

<h3>Wave packet dynamics and edge transport in anomalous Floquet topological  phases</h3>

The possibility of attaining chiral edge modes under periodic driving has
spurred tremendous attention, both theoretically and experimentally, especially
in light of anomalous Floquet topological phases that feature vanishing Chern
numbers unlike any static counterpart. We here consider a periodically
modulated honeycomb lattice and experimentally relevant driving protocols,
which allows us to obtain edge modes of various character in a simple model. We
calculate the phase diagram over a wide range of parameters and recover an
anomalous topological phase with quasienergy gaps harbouring edge states with
opposite chirality. Motivated by the advances in single-site control in optical
lattices, we investigate wave packet dynamics localized at the edges in
distinct Floquet topological regimes that cannot be achieved in equilibrium. We
analyse transport properties in edge modes originating from the same bands, but
with support at different quasienergies and sublattices as well as possessing
different chiralities. We find that an anomalous Floquet topological phase can
in general generate more robust chiral edge motion than a Haldane phase. Our
results demonstrate that the rich interplay of wave packet dynamics and
topological edge states can serve as a versatile tool in ultracold quantum
gases in optical lattices.

We study Fermi-Hubbard models with kinetically constrained dynamics that
conserves both total particle number and total center of mass, a situation that
arises when interacting fermions are placed in strongly tilted optical
lattices. Through a combination of analytics and numerics, we show how the
kinetic constraints stabilize an exotic non-Fermi liquid phase described by
fermions coupled to a gapless bosonic field, which in many respects mimics a
dynamical gauge field. This offers a novel route towards the study of non-Fermi
liquid phases in the precision environments afforded by ultracold atom
platforms.
