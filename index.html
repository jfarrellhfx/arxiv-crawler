<h3>Superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene: possible pairing  symmetries, impurity-induced states and Chern number</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13030" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13030</a>

<br>
<br>
We consider the most energetically favorable symmetry-allowed spin-singlet
and spin-triplet superconducting pairing symmetries in twisted bilayer graphene
at the magic angle, whose normal state physics is described by a six-band
effective tight-binding model. We compute the Chern number as a function of the
superconducting order parameter strength and the chemical potential and we find
a topological phase transition only for the chiral $p+ip'$ superconducting
state. Different from the regular graphene systems for which this happens at
the van Hove singularity, for TBG the topological phase transition arises at
the point where the Fermi surface becomes tangent to the boundary of the first
Brillouin zone. For each pairing symmetry we study the formation of subgap
impurity states for both scalar and magnetic impurities. We analyze the number
of subgap states as well as their spin polarized density of states that we find
to exhibit peculiar properties that allows one to distinguish between
spin-singlet and triplet pairing. Thus only triplet-paired states may exhibit
opposite-energy impurity states with the same spin, same as for regular
graphene systems\, moreover we find that this spin may flip at the
twist-induced van Hove singularity.

<h3>Supersymmetry on the honeycomb lattice: resonating charge stripes,  superfrustration, and domain walls</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13031" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13031</a>

<br>
<br>
We study a model of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with
nearest-neighbor exclusion and extended repulsive interactions that exhibits
`lattice supersymmetry' [P. Fendley, K. Schoutens, and J. de Boer, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 90, 120402 (2003)]. Using a combination of exact diagonalization of large
($N\leq56$ site) systems, mean-field numerics, and symmetry analysis, we
establish a rich phase structure as a function of fermion density, that
includes non-Fermi liquid behavior, resonating charge stripes, domain-wall and
bubble physics, and identify a finite range of fillings with extensive ground
state degeneracy and both gapped and gapless spectra. We comment on the
stability of our results to relaxing the stringent requirements for
supersymmetry, and on their possible broader relevance to systems of
strongly-correlated electrons with extended repulsive interactions.

<h3>Charge and Entanglement Criticality in a U(1)-Symmetric Hybrid Circuit  of Qubits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13038" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13038</a>

<i>Ahana Chakraborty, Kun Chen, Aidan Zabalo, Justin H. Wilson, J. H. Pixley</i>
<br>
<br>
We study critical properties of the entanglement and charge-sharpening
measurement-induced phase transitions in a non-unitary quantum circuit evolving
with a U(1) conserved charge. Many critical properties appear distinct from the
generic non-conserving case and percolation; however, upon interpreting the
critical features as mixtures of both entanglement and charge-sharpening
transitions, many critical features are brought within range of the generic
case. Nonetheless, the multifractal properties of the entanglement transition
remain distinct from the generic case without any symmetry, indicating a unique
universality class due to the U(1) symmetry. We compute entanglement critical
exponents and correlation functions via various ancilla measures, use a
transfer matrix for multifractality, and compute correlators associated with
charge sharpening to explain these findings. Through these correlators, we also
find evidence consistent with the charge-sharpening transition being of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type (including the predicted "jump" in
stiffness), which simultaneously argues for a broad critical fan for this
transition. As a result, attempts to measure critical properties in this system
will see anomalously large exponents consistent with overlapping criticality.

<h3>Integrability breaking and bound states in Google's decorated XXZ  circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13042" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13042</a>
<br>
<i>Ana Hudomal, Ryan Smith, Andrew Hallam, Zlatko Papić</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent quantum simulation by Google [Nature 612, 240 (2022)] has demonstrated
the formation of bound states of interacting photons in a quantum-circuit
version of the XXZ spin chain. While such bound states are protected by
integrability in a one-dimensional chain, the experiment found the bound states
to be unexpectedly robust when integrability was broken by decorating the
circuit with additional qubits, at least for small numbers of qubits ($\leq
24$) within the experimental capability. Here we scrutinize this result by
state-of-the-art classical simulations, which greatly exceed the experimental
system sizes and provide a benchmark for future studies in larger circuits. We
find that the bound states consisting of a small and finite number of photons
are indeed robust in the non-integrable regime, even after scaling to the
infinite time and infinite system size limit. Moreover, we show that such
systems possess unusual spectral properties, with level statistics that
deviates from the random matrix theory expectation. On the other hand, for low
but finite density of photons, we find a much faster onset of thermalization
and significantly weaker signatures of bound states, suggesting that anomalous
dynamics may only be a property of dilute systems with zero density of photons
in the thermodynamic limit. The robustness of the bound states is also
influenced by the number of decoration qubits and, to a lesser degree, by the
regularity of their spatial arrangement.

<h3>Bipolar thermoelectrical SQUIPT (BTSQUIPT)</h3>

<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the quasiparticle current behaviour of a
thermally-biased bipolar thermoelectrical superconducting quantum interference
proximity transistor, formed by a normal metal wire embedded in a
superconducting ring and tunnel-coupled to a superconducting probe. In this
configuration, the superconducting gap of the wire can be modified through an
applied magnetic flux. We analyse the thermoelectric response as a function of
magnetic flux, at fixed temperatures, in the case of a device made of the same
superconductor. We demonstrate magnetically controllable, bipolar
thermoelectric behaviour and discuss optimal working conditions by looking at
the thermoelectric power and other figures of merit of the device.

<h3>Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of Bose-Bose mixtures in optical lattices</h3>

<br>
<i>Pardeep Kaur, Kuldeep Suthar, Dilip Angom, Sandeep Gautam</i>
<br>
<br>
We examine the quench dynamics across quantum phase transitions from a Mott
insulator (MI) to a superfluid (SF) phase in a two-component bosonic mixture in
an optical lattice. We show that two-component Bose mixtures exhibit
qualitatively different quantum dynamics than one-component Bose gas. Besides
second-order MI-SF transitions, we also investigate quench dynamics across a
first-order MI-SF transition. The Bose mixtures show the critical slowing down
of dynamics near the critical transition point, as proposed by the Kibble-Zurek
mechanism. For MI-SF transitions with homogeneous lattice-site distributions in
the MI phase, the dynamical critical exponents extracted by the power-law
scaling of the proposed quantities obtained via numerical simulations are in
very close agreement with the mean-field predictions.

High pressure plays a crucial role in the field of superconductivity.
Compressed hydride superconductors are leaders in the race for a material that
can conduct electricity without resistance at high or even room temperature.
Different synthetic paths under pressure will drive the formation of different
polyhydrides. In the present work, through precise control of the synthesis
pathway, we have discovered new lanthanum superhydride, cubic A15-type
La$_4$H$_{23}$, with lower stabilization pressure compared to the reported
$\textit{fcc}$ LaH$_{10}$. Superconducting La$_4$H$_{23}$ was obtained by laser
heating of LaH$_3$ with ammonia borane at about 120 GPa. Transport measurements
reveal the maximum critical temperature $\textit{T}$$_{C}$(onset) = 105 K at
118 GPa, as evidenced by the sharp drop of electrical resistance and the
displacement of superconducting transitions in applied magnetic fields.
Extrapolated upper critical field $\textit{B}$$_{C2}$(0) of La$_4$H$_{23}$ is
about 33 T at 114 GPa in agreement with theoretical estimates. Discovered
lanthanum hydride is a new member of the A15 family of superconductors with
$\textit{T}$$_C$ exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.

<h3>Finite Size Effects in Addition and Chipping Processes</h3>

We investigate analytically and numerically a system of clusters evolving via
collisions with clusters of minimal mass (monomers). Each collision either
leads to the addition of the monomer to the cluster or the chipping of a
monomer from the cluster, and emerging behaviors depend on which of the two
processes is more probable. If addition prevails, monomers disappear in a time
that scales as $\ln N$ with the total mass $N\gg 1$, and the system reaches a
jammed state. When chipping prevails, the system remains in a quasi-stationary
state for a time that scales exponentially with $N$, but eventually, a giant
fluctuation leads to the disappearance of monomers. In the marginal case,
monomers disappear in a time that scales linearly with $N$, and the final
supercluster state is a peculiar jammed state, viz., it is not extensive.

<h3>Spintronic Quantum Phase Transition in a $Graphene/Pb_{0.24}Sn_{0.76}Te$  Heterostructure with Giant Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13113" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13113</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Mechanical stacking of two dissimilar materials often has surprising
consequences for heterostructure behavior. In particular, a two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) is formed in the heterostructure of the topological
crystalline insulator Pb0.24Sn0.76Te and graphene due to contact of a polar
with a nonpolar surface and the resulting changes in electronic structure
needed to avoid polar catastrophe. We study the spintronic properties of this
heterostructure with non-local spin valve devices. We observe spin-momentum
locking at lower temperatures that transitions to regular spin channel
transport only at ~40 K. Hanle spin precession measurements show a spin
relaxation time as high as 2.18 ns. Density functional theory calculations
confirm that the spin-momentum locking is due to a giant Rashba effect in the
material and that the phase transition is a Lifshitz transition. The
theoretically predicted Lifshitz transition is further evident in the phase
transition-like behavior in the Land\'e g-factor and spin relaxation time.

<h3>Active oscillatory associative memory</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13123" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13123</a>
<br>
<i>Matthew Du, Agnish Kumar Behera, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan</i>
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, physical models of associative memory assume conditions of
equilibrium. Here, we consider a prototypical oscillator model of associative
memory and study how active noise sources that drive the system out of
equilibrium, as well as nonlinearities in the interactions between the
oscillators, affect the associative memory properties of the system. Our
simulations show that pattern retrieval under active noise is more robust to
the number of learned patterns and noise intensity than under passive noise. To
understand this phenomenon, we analytically derive an effective energy
correction due to the temporal correlations of active noise in the limit of
short correlation decay time. We find that active noise deepens the energy
wells corresponding to the patterns by strengthening the oscillator couplings,
where the more nonlinear interactions are preferentially enhanced. Using
replica theory, we demonstrate qualitative agreement between this effective
picture and the retrieval simulations. Our work suggests that nonlinearity in
the oscillator couplings can improve memory under nonequilibrium conditions.

<h3>Size scaling of failure strength at high disorder</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13138" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13138</a>
<br>
<i>Zsuzsa Danku, Gergő Pál, Ferenc Kun</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate how the macroscopic response and the size scaling of the
ultimate strength of materials change when their local strength is sampled from
a fat-tailed distribution and the degree of disorder is varied in a broad
range. Using equal and localized load sharing in a fiber bundle model, we
demonstrate that a transition occurs from a perfectly brittle to a
quasi-brittle behaviour as the amount of disorder is gradually increased. When
the load sharing is localized the high load concentration around failed regions
make the system more prone to failure so that a higher degree of disorder is
required for stabilization. Increasing the system size at a fixed degree of
disorder an astonishing size effect is obtained: at small sizes the ultimate
strength of the system increases with its size, the usual decreasing behaviour
sets on only beyond a characteristic system size. The increasing regime of the
size effect prevails even for localized load sharing, however, above the
characteristic system size the load concentration results in a substantial
strength reduction compared to equal load sharing. We show that an adequate
explanation of the results can be obtained based on the extreme order
statistics of fibers' strength.

<h3>Static wetting of a barrel-shaped droplet on a soft-layer-coated fiber</h3>

<br>
<br>
A droplet can deform a soft substrate due to capillary forces when they are
in contact. We study the static deformation of a soft solid layer coated on a
rigid cylindrical fiber when an axisymmetric barrel-shaped droplet is embracing
it. We find that the elastic deformation increases with decreasing rigid fiber
radius. Significant disparities of deformation between the solid-liquid side
and the solid-gas side are found when their solid surface tensions are
different. When the coated layer is soft enough and the rigid fiber radius is
less than the thickness of the coated layer, pronounced displacement
oscillations are observed. Such slow decay of deformation with distances from
the contact line position suggests a possible long-range interaction between
droplets on a soft-layer-coated fiber.

<h3>Competing phases and intertwined orders in coupled wires near the  self-dual point</h3>

<br>
<br>
The interplay between different quantum phases plays an important role in
strongly correlated systems, such as high-$T_c$ cuprates, quantum spin systems,
and ultracold atoms. In particular, the application of effective field theory
model and renormalization group analysis suggested that the coexistence of
density wave (DW) and superfluid (SF) orders can lead to a supersolid phase of
ultracold bosons. Here we revisit the problem by considering weakly coupled
wires, where we treat the intra-wire interactions exactly via bosonization and
inter-wire couplings using a mean-field theory which becomes asymptotically
exact in the limit of high dimensionality. We obtain and solve the mean-field
equations for the system near the self-dual point, where each wire has the
Luttinger parameter $K=1$ and the inter-wire DW and SF coupling strengths are
identical. This allows us to find explicit solutions for the possible
supersolid order. An energy comparison between different possible solutions
shows that the supersolid order is energetically unfavorable at zero
temperature. This suggests that the density wave and superfluid phases are
connected by a first order transition near the self-dual point. We also discuss
the relation between our work and the intertwining of charge density wave and
superconducting orders in cuprates.

<h3>Interface Modification for Energy Levels Alignment and Charge Extraction  in CsPbI$_3$ Perovskite Solar Cells</h3>

<br>
<br>
In perovskite solar cells (PSCs) energy levels alignment and charge
extraction at the interfaces are the essential factors directly affecting the
device performance. In this work, we present a modified interface between
all-inorganic CsPbI$_3$ perovskite and its hole selective contact
(Spiro-OMeTAD), realized by a dipole molecule trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO),
to align the energy levels. On a passivated perovskite film, by n-Octyl
ammonium Iodide (OAI), we created an upward surface band-bending at the
interface by TOPO treatment. This improved interface by the dipole molecule
induces a better energy level alignment and enhances the charge extraction of
holes from the perovskite layer to the hole transport material. Consequently, a
Voc of 1.2 V and high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% were
achieved for inorganic CsPbI$_3$ perovskite solar cells. Further, to
demonstrate the effect of the TOPO dipole molecule, we present a layer-by-layer
charge extraction study by transient surface photovoltage technique (trSPV)
accomplished by charge transport simulation.

Understanding nucleation from aqueous solutions is of fundamental importance
in a multitude of fields, ranging from materials science to biophysics. The
complex solvent-mediated interactions in aqueous solutions hamper the
development of a simple physical picture elucidating the roles of different
interactions in nucleation processes. In this work we make use of three
complementary techniques to disentangle the role played by short and long-range
interactions in solvent mediated nucleation. Specifically, the first approach
we utilize is the local molecular field (LMF) theory to renormalize long-range
Coulomb electrostatics. Secondly, we use well-tempered metadynamics to speed up
rare events governed by short-range interactions. Thirdly, deep learning-based
State Predictive Information Bottleneck approach is employed in analyzing the
reaction coordinate of the nucleation processes obtained from LMF treatment
coupled with well-tempered metadynamics. We find that the two-step nucleation
mechanism can largely be captured by the short-range interactions, while the
long-range interactions further contribute to the stability of the primary
crystal state at ambient conditions. Furthermore, by analyzing the reaction
coordinate obtained from combined LMF-metadynamics treatment, we discern the
the fluctuations on different time scales, highlighting the need for long-range
interactions when accounting for metastability.

<h3>Analytical Insights and Universal Behavior in Fast Thermal Equilibration  Protocols</h3>

When a system deviates from equilibrium, it is possible to manipulate and
control it to drive it towards equilibrium within a finite time $t_f$, even
reducing its natural relaxation time scale $\tau_{relax}$. Although numerous
theoretical and experimental studies have explored these shortcut protocols,
few have yielded analytical results for the probability distribution of work,
heat and entropy production. In this paper, we propose a two-step protocol that
captures the essential characteristics of more general protocols and has
analytical solution for the relevant thermodynamic probability distributions.
Additionally, we demonstrate that for very short protocol duration $t_f\ll
\tau_{relax}$, all protocols exhibit universal behavior in their shape and for
the ratio of probability distribution functions of positive and negative work,
heat and the entropy production.

$\mathcal{H}\Phi$ [$aitch$-$phi$] is an open-source software package of
numerically exact and stochastic calculations for a wide range of quantum
many-body systems. In this paper, we present the newly added functions and the
implemented methods in vers. 2 and 3. In ver. 2, we implement spectrum
calculations by the shifted Krylov method, and low-energy excited state
calculations by the locally optimal blocking preconditioned conjugate gradient
(LOBPCG) method. In ver. 3, we implement the full diagonalization method using
ScaLAPACK and GPGPU computing via MAGMA. We also implement a real-time
evolution method and the canonical thermal pure quantum (cTPQ) state method for
finite-temperature calculations. The Wannier90 format for specifying the
Hamiltonians is also implemented. Using the Wannier90 format, it is possible to
perform the calculations for the $ab$ $initio$ low-energy effective
Hamiltonians of solids obtained by the open-source software RESPACK. We also
update Standard mode $\unicode{x2014}$simplified input format in
$\mathcal{H}\Phi$$\unicode{x2014}$ to use these functions and methods. We
explain the basics of the implemented methods and how to use them.

<h3>The Structural Difference Between Strong and Fragile Liquids</h3>

A structural order parameter for disordered configurations is defined, based,
not on local topologies, but on the degree of local restraint imposed on each
atom. This restraint parameter provides a clear distinction between a strong
liquid (SiO2) and a fragile liquid (a binary Lennard-Jones mixture) without
reference to dynamics. Where the fragile liquid exhibits an abrupt transition
from unrestrained to restrain below the melting point, molten silica is highly
constrained even at equilibrium. We determine the temperature dependence of the
average number of particles restrained per pinned particle and consider the
feature of the potential energy landscape responsible for determining the
fragility.

<h3>Two-stage random sequential adsorption of discorectangles and disks on a  two-dimensional surface</h3>

<br>
<br>
The different variants of two-stage random sequential adsorption (RSA) models
for packing of disks and discorectangles on a two-dimensional (2D) surface were
investigated. In the SD model, the discorectangles were first deposited and
then the disks were added. In the DS model, the disks were first deposited and
then discorectangles were added. At the first stage the particles were
deposited up to the selected concentration and at the final (second) stage the
particles were deposited up to the saturated (jamming) state. The main
parameters of the models were the concentration of particles deposited at the
first stage, aspect ratio of the discorectangles $\varepsilon$ (length to
diameter of ratio $\varepsilon=l/d$) and disk diameter $D$. All distances were
measured using the value of $d$ as a unit of measurement of linear dimensions,
the disk diameter was varied in the interval $D \in [1-10]$, and the aspect
ratio value was varied in the interval $\varepsilon\in [1-50]$. The
dependencies of the jamming coverage of particles deposited at the second stage
versus the parameters of the models were analyzed. The presence of first
deposited particles for both models regulated the maximum possible disk
diameter, $D_{max}$ (SD model) or the maximum aspect ratio, $\varepsilon_{max}$
(DS model). This behavior was explained by the deposition of particles in the
second stage into triangular (SD model) or elongated (DS model) pores formed by
particles deposited at the first stage. The percolation connectivity of disks
(SD model) and discorectangles (DS model) for the particles with a hard core
and a soft shell structure was analyzed. The disconnectedness was ensured by
overlapping of soft shells. The dependencies of connectivity versus the
parameters of SD and DS models were also analyzed.

We theoretically study transient electroosmotic flow of general Maxwell
fluids through polyelectrolyte grafted nanochannel with a layered distribution
of charges. By applying the method of Laplace transform, we semi-analytically
obtain transient electroosmotic flow from Cauchy momentum equation and Maxwell
constitutive equation.
For nanochannels grafted with polyelectrolyte layers having different layered
distribution of charges, we study the influence of dimensionless relaxation
time, dimensionless polyelectrolyte layer thickness and dimensionless drag
coefficient on transient electroosmotic flow. We verify that adjusting charge
distributions of the layer can control intentionally the direction of the flows
as well as strength of electroosmotic flow.

<br>
<br>
We study the collective vibrational excitations of crystals under
out-of-equilibrium steady conditions that give rise to entropy production.
Their excitation spectrum comprises equilibrium-like phonons of thermal origin
and additional collective excitations called entropons because each of them
represents a mode of spectral entropy production. Entropons coexist with
phonons and dominate over them when the system is far from equilibrium while
they are negligible in near-equilibrium regimes. The concept of entropons has
been recently introduced and verified in a special case of crystals formed by
self-propelled particles. Here, we show that entropons exist in a broader class
of active cyrstals that are intrinsically out of equilibrium and characterized
by the lack of detailed balance. After a general derivation, several explicit
examples are discussed, including crystals consisting of particles with
alignment interactions and frictional contact forces.

<h3>Layer number and stacking order-dependent thermal transport in  molybdenum disulfide with sulfur vacancies</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13311" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13311</a>
<br>
<i>Ranjuna M K, Jayakumar Balakrishnan</i>
<br>
<br>
Recent theoretical works on two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide, MoS$_2$,
with sulfur vacancies predict that the suppression of thermal transport in
MoS$_2$ by point defects is more prominent in monolayers and becomes negligible
as layer number increases. Here, we investigate experimentally the thermal
transport properties of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide crystals with
inherent sulfur vacancies. We study the first-order temperature coefficients of
interlayer and intralayer Raman modes of MoS$_2$ crystals with different layer
numbers and stacking orders. The in-plane thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) and
total interface conductance per unit area ($ g $) across the 2D
material-substrate interface of mono-, bi- and tri-layer MoS$_2$ samples are
measured using the micro-Raman thermometry. Our results clearly demonstrate
that the thermal conductivity is significantly suppressed by sulfur vacancies
in monolayer MoS$_2$. However, this reduction in $\kappa$ becomes less evident
as the layer number increases, confirming the theoretical predictions. No
significant variation is observed in the $\kappa$ and $ g $ values of 2H and 3R
stacked bilayer MoS$_2$ samples.

Higher-order topological phases are gapped phases of matter that host gapless
corner or hinge modes. For the case of superconductors, corner or hinge modes
are gapless Majorana modes or Majorana zero modes. To construct 3d higher-order
topological superconductors, we consider a topological-insulator/superconductor
multilayer under in-plane Zeeman coupling. We found three different types of
higher-order topological superconductor phases, a second-order topological
superconductor phase with Majorana hinge flat bands, a second-order Dirac
superconductor phase with surface Majorana cones and Majorana hinge arcs, and
nodal-line superconductor phases with drumhead surface states and Majorana
hinge arcs.

In the last six years (2015-2021), many superconducting hydrides with
critical temperatures $\textit{T}$$_C$ of up to 253 K, a record for today, have
been discovered. Now, a special field of hydride superconductivity at ultrahigh
pressures has developed. For the most part, the properties of superhydrides are
well described by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of strong electron-phonon
interaction, especially when anharmonicity of phonons is taken into account.
The isotope effect, the effect of the magnetic field (up to 60-70 T) on the
critical temperature and critical current in the hydride samples, the
dependence of $\textit{T}$$_C$ on the pressure and degree of doping - all data
indicate that polyhydrides are conventional superconductors, the theory of
which was created by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957.
This work presents a retrospective analysis of data for 2015-2021 and
describes the main directions for future research in the field of hydride
superconductivity. The thesis consists of six chapters devoted to the study of
the structure and superconductivity of binary and ternary superhydrides of
thorium (ThH$_9$ and ThH$_{10}$), yttrium (YH$_6$ and YH$_9$), europium and
other lanthanides (Ce, Pr, Nd), and lanthanum-yttrium (La-Y). This work
describes the physical properties of cubic decahydrides, hexahydrides, and
hexagonal metal nonahydrides, demonstrates high efficiency of evolutionary
algorithms and density functional methods in predicting the formation of
polyhydrides under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. We proposed a
theoretical-experimental algorithm for analyzing the superconducting properties
of hydrides, which makes it possible to systematize the accumulated
experimental data. In general, this research is a vivid example of the
effectiveness and synergy of modern methods for studying the condensed state of
matter under high pressures.

<br>
<br>
Identifying the necessary conditions for the onset of rigidity in a gel
remains a challenge. It has been suggested that local particle coordination
could be used to establish such conditions, but rigid gels occur for various
coordination numbers. Combining simulations, oscillatory rheology, and a
percolation analysis, for particles where the valence can be controlled, we
find that the onset of rigidity coincides with the percolation of particles
with three or more bonds, which arises after the connectivity percolation. We
show that the rigidity results from an interplay of bonding and non-bonding
interactions, providing insight into low-valence colloidal gel rigidity.

Three-terminal coherent conductors are able to perform as quantum
thermocouples when the heat absorbed from one terminal is transformed into
useful power in the other two. Allowing for a phase coherent coupling to the
heat source we introduce a way to control and improve the thermoelectric
response via quantum interference. A simple setup composed of a scanning probe
between two resonant tunneling regions is proposed that achieves better
performance than incoherent analogues by enhancing the generated power and
efficiency, and reducing the output current noise.

Analog tunable memristors are widely utilized as artificial synapses in
various neural network applications. However, exploiting the dynamical aspects
of their conductance change to implement active neurons is still in its
infancy, awaiting the realization of efficient neural signal recognition
functionalities. Here we experimentally demonstrate an artificial neural
information processing unit that can detect a temporal pattern in a very noisy
environment, fire a single output spike upon successful detection and reset
itself in a fully unsupervised, autonomous manner. This circuit relies on the
dynamical operation of only two memristive blocks: a non-volatile Ta$_2$O$_5$
device and a volatile VO$_2$ unit. A fading functionality with exponentially
tunable memory time constant enables adaptive operation dynamics, which can be
tailored for the targeted temporal pattern recognition task. In the trained
circuit false input patterns only induce short-term variations. In contrast,
the desired signal activates long-term memory operation of the non-volatile
component, which triggers a firing output of the volatile block.

<h3>Dissipative Chiral Channels, Ohmic Scaling and Half-integer Hall  Conductivity from the Relativistic Quantum Hall Effect</h3>

The quantum Hall effect (QHE), which was observed in 2D electron gas under an
external magnetic field, stands out as one of the most remarkable transport
phenomena in condensed matter. However, a long standing puzzle remains
regarding the observation of the relativistic quantum Hall effect (RQHE). This
effect, predicted for a single 2D Dirac cone immersed in a magnetic field, is
distinguished by the intriguing feature of half-integer Hall conductivity
(HIHC). In this work, we demonstrate that the condensed-matter realization of
the RQHE and the direct measurement of the HIHC are feasible by investigating
the underlying quantum transport mechanism. We reveal that the manifestation of
HIHC is tied to the presence of dissipative half-integer quantized chiral
channels circulating along the interface of the RQHE system and a Dirac metal.
Importantly, we find that the Ohmic scaling of the longitudinal conductance of
the system plays a key role in directly measuring the HIHC in experiments.
Furthermore, we propose a feasible experimental scheme based on the 3D
topological insulators to directly measure the HIHC. Our findings not only
uncover the distinct transport mechanism of the HIHC for the RQHE, but also
paves the way to the measurement of the HIHC in future experiments.

<h3>Negative diffusion of excitons in quasi-two-dimensional systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
We show how two different mobile-immobile type models explain the observation
of negative diffusion of excitons reported in experimental studies in
quasi-two-dimensional semiconductor systems. The main reason for the effect is
the initial trapping and a delayed release of free excitons in the area close
to the original excitation spot. The density of trapped excitons is not
registered experimentally. Hence, the signal from the free excitons alone
includes the delayed release of not diffusing trapped particles. This is seen
as the narrowing of the exciton density profile or decrease of mean-squared
displacement which is then interpreted as a negative diffusion. The effect is
enhanced with the increase of recombination intensity as well as the rate of
the exciton-exciton binary interactions.

We study theoretically the electronic properties of the artificial quantum
dot honeycomb lattice defined in a two-dimensional electron gas, focusing on
the possibility of achieving a regime in which electronic correlations play a
dominant role. At first we establish a non-interacting model compatible with
recently studied experimentally devices. According to the values of the
obtained electron-electron interaction integrals, we postulate that the
inclusion of inherent electron-gas self-screening is indispensable to
reconstruct the experimental observations. Applying the Thomas-Fermi type of
screening, we show that the radius of the anti-dot is crucial to achieve a
correlated state in which phenomena like antiferromagentic ordering and
interaction-induced insulating state appear. We estimate the conditions for
which the electronically correlated state in an artificial honeycomb lattice
can be realized.

A tunneling junction between normal electrode and a topological
superconducting wire, mediated by a quantum dot, is considered theoretically.
We show that the presence of the dot in the junction can be advantageous to
Majorana zero modes identification. Namely, we demonstrate that for the dot
strongly coupled to the wire, the Majorana mode from the upper chiral sub-band
"leaks" into the dot, providing supplementary information on Majorana mode
formation. Thus, both the Zeeman-split dot sub-levels detect Majorana partners
of a Kramers pair, formed at the wire end. The characteristic three-peak
structures in both spin sectors of the spectral density of the dot, distinguish
from the trivial scenario of one Andreev resonance at Fermi energy produced
exclusively by the dot's spin sub-levels.

Chirality is an indispensable concept that pervades fundamental science and
nature, manifesting itself in diverse forms such as chiral quasiparticles and
chiral structures. Of particular interest are Weyl phonons carrying specific
Chern numbers and chiral phonons doing circular motions in crystals. Up to now,
Weyl and chiral phonons have been studied independently and the interpretations
of chirality seem to be different in these two concepts, impeding our
understanding. Here, we demonstrate that Weyl and chiral phonons are entangled
in chiral crystals. Employing a typical chiral crystal of elementary tellurium
(Te) as a case study, we expound on the intrinsic relationship between Chern
number of Weyl phonons and pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) of chiral phonons. In
light of the mutual coupling, we propose Raman scattering as a new technique to
demonstrate the existence of Weyl phonons in Te, by detecting the
chirality-induced energy splitting between the two constituent chiral phonon
branches for Weyl phonons. By using the same experimental approach, we also
observe the obstructed phonon surface states for the first time.

We report on the transport of ultracold cesium and rubidium atoms over
$37.2\,$cm in under $25\,$ms using an optical conveyor belt formed by two
counter-propagating beams with a controllable frequency difference that
generate a movable optical lattice. By carefully selecting the waists and focus
positions, we are able to use two static Gaussian beams for the transport,
avoiding the need for a Bessel beam or vari-focus lenses. We characterize the
transport efficiency for both species, including a comparison of different
transport trajectories, gaining insight into the loss mechanisms and finding
the minimum jerk trajectory to be optimum. Using the optimized parameters, we
are able to transport up to $7 \times 10^6$ cesium or rubidium atoms with an
efficiency up to $75\,$%. To demonstrate the viability of our transport scheme
for experiments employing quantum gas microscopy, we produce Bose-Einstein
condensates of either species after transport and present measurements of the
simultaneous transport of both species.

<h3>Scaling of granular column collapses on inclined planes</h3>

Granular column collapse is a simple but important problem to the granular
material community, due to its links to dynamics of natural hazards, such as
landslides and pyroclastic flows, and many industrial situations, as well as
its potential of analyzing transient and non-local rheology of granular flows.
This article proposes a new dimensionless number to describe the run-out
behaviour of granular columns on inclined planes based on both previous
experimental data and dimensional analysis. With the assistance of the
sphero-polyhedral discrete element method (DEM), we simulate inclined granular
column collapses with different initial aspect ratios, inter-particle
frictions, and initial solid fractions on inclined planes with different
inclination angles (2.5$^{\circ}$ - 20.0$^{\circ}$) to verify the proposed
dimensional analysis. Detailed analyses are further provided for better
understanding of the influence of different initial conditions and boundary
conditions, and to help unify the description of the relative run-out distances
of systems with different inclination angles. This work determines the
similarity and unity between granular column collapses on inclined planes and
those on horizontal planes, and helps investigate the transient rheological
behaviour of granular flows, which has direct relevance to various natural and
engineering systems.

Weak antilocalization (WAL) effect is commonly observed in 2D systems, or 3D
topological insulators, topological semimetal systems. Here we report the clear
sign of WAL effect in high quality Ta$_{0.7}$Nb$_{0.3}$Sb$_2$ single crystals,
in below 50$^\circ$ K region. The chemical vapor transport method was employed
to grow the single crystal samples, the high crystallization quality and
uniform element distribution are verified by X-ray diffractions and electron
microscopy techniques. Employing the Hall effect and two-band model fitting,
the high carrier mobility (> 1000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ in 2 to 300$^\circ$ K
region) and off-compensation electron/hole ratio are obtained. Due to the
different angular dependence of WAL effect and the fermiology of
Ta$_{0.7}$Nb$_{0.3}$Sb$_2$ single crystal, interesting magnetic-field-induced
symmetry change is observed in angular magnetoresistance. These interesting
transport properties will lead to more theoretical and applicational
exploration in Ta$_{0.7}$Nb$_{0.3}$Sb$_2$ and related semimetal materials.

Understanding the mechanism of ferromagnetism in ferromagnetic topological
insulators (TIs) is a key to realize exotic time-reversal-symmetry-broken
quantum phases. However, electronic states relevant to the ferromagnetism are
highly controversial. Here we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
on (CrxSb1-x)2Te3 thin films, high-Curie-temperature (T_C) ferromagnetic TIs,
spanning the non-doped (T_C=0 K) to highly-doped (T_C=192 K) region. We found
that, upon Cr doping to Sb2Te3, the bulk valence-band valley exhibits
filling-in behavior while retaining band inversion, leading to the formation of
a nearly-flat band in high-T_C regime and evolution from a six-petal flower to
a Star-of-David Fermi surface. Despite the weakening of spin-orbit coupling
with Cr doping, the Dirac-cone state persists up to the highest-T_C sample, and
shows a clear magnetic-gap opening below TC accompanied with an unexpected band
shift, signifying its strong coupling with spontaneous ferromagnetism. The
present result lays the foundation for understanding the interplay between band
topology and ferromagnetism in TIs.

Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) offers a nonferromagnetic scheme to realize spin
polarization through utilizing an electric field. Electrically tunable SOI
through electrostatic gates have been investigated, however, the relatively
weak and volatile tunability limit its practical applications in spintronics.
Here, we demonstrate the nonvolatile electric-field control of SOI via
constructing ferroelectric Rashba architectures, i.e., 2D Bi2O2Se/PMN-PT
ferroelectric field effect transistors. The experimentally observed weak
antilocalization (WAL) cusp in Bi2O2Se films implies the Rashba-type SOI that
arises from asymmetric confinement potential. Significantly, taking advantage
of the switchable ferroelectric polarization, the WAL-to-weak localization (WL)
transition trend reveals the competition between spin relaxation and dephasing
process, and the variation of carrier density leads to a reversible and
nonvolatile modulation of spin relaxation time and spin splitting energy of
Bi2O2Se films by this ferroelectric gating. Our work provides a scheme to
achieve nonvolatile control of Rashba SOI with the utilization of ferroelectric
remanent polarization.

<h3>A complete escape from localization on a hierarchical lattice: a Koch  fractal with all states extended</h3>

<br>
<br>
An infinitely large Koch fractal is shown to be capable of sustaining only
extended, Bloch-like eigenstates, if certain parameters of the Hamiltonian
describing the lattice are numerically correlated in a special way, and a
magnetic flux of a special strength is trapped in every loop of the geometry.
We describe the system within a tight binding formalism and prescribe the
desired correlation between the numerical values of the nearest neighbor
overlap integrals, along with a special value of the magnetic flux trapped in
the triangular loops decorating the fractal. With such conditions, the lattice,
despite the absence of translational order of any kind whatsoever, yields an
absolutely continuous eigenvalue spectrum, and becomes completely transparent
to an incoming electron with any energy within the allowed band. The results
are analytically exact. An in-depth numerical study of the inverse
participation ratio and the two-terminal transmission coefficient corroborates
our findings. Our conclusions remain valid for a large set of lattice models,
built with the same structural units, but beyond the specific geometry of a
Koch fractal, unraveling a subtle universality in a variety of such low
dimensional systems.

As one of the most important n-type thermoelectric (TE) materials, Bi2Te3 has
been studied for decades, with efforts to enhance the thermoelectric
performance based on element doping, band engineering, etc. In this study, we
report a novel bulk-insulating topological material system as a replacement for
n-type Bi2Te3 materials: V doped Bi1.08Sn0.02Sb0.9Te2S (V:BSSTS) . The V:BSSTS
is a bulk insulator with robust metallic topological surface states.
Furthermore, the bulk band gap can be tuned by the doping level of V, which is
verified by magnetotransport measurements. Large linear magnetoresistance is
observed in all samples. Excellent thermoelectric performance is obtained in
the V:BSSTS samples, e.g., the highest figure of merit ZT of ~ 0.8 is achieved
in the 2% V doped sample (denoted as V0.02) at 550 K. The high thermoelectric
performance of V:BSSTS can be attributed to two synergistic effects: (1) the
low conductive secondary phases Sb2S3, and V2S3 are believed to be important
scattering centers for phonons, leading to lower lattice thermal conductivity;
and (2) the electrical conductivity is increased due to the high-mobility
topological surface states at the boundaries. In addition, by replacing one
third of costly tellurium with abundant, low-cost, and less-toxic sulfur
element, the newly produced BSSTS material is inexpensive but still has
comparable TE performance to the traditional Bi2Te3-based materials, which
offers a cheaper plan for the electronics and thermoelectric industries. Our
results demonstrate that topological materials with unique band structures can
provide a new platform in the search for new high performance TE materials.

Tailoring the quantum many-body interactions in layered materials through
appropriate heterostructure engineering can result in emergent properties that
are absent in the constituent materials thus promising potential future
applications. In this article, we have demonstrated controlling the otherwise
robust magnetic properties of transition metal phosphorus trisulphides
(Mn/Fe/NiPS3) in their heterostructures with Weyl semimetallic MoTe2 which can
be attributed to the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya (DM) interactions at the interface
of the two different layered materials. While the DM interaction is known to
scale with the strength of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we also demonstrate
here that the effect of DM interaction strongly varies with the spin
orientation/dimensionality of the magnetic layer and the low-energy electronic
density of state of the spin-orbit coupled layer. The observations are further
supported by a series of experiments on heterostructures with a variety of
substrates/underlayers hosting variable SOC and electronic density of states.

General features of the $\alpha-\beta$ transition of quartz are investigated.
Molecular dynamics methods are mainly used, an analytic treatment being
deferred to a work in preparation. A basic preliminary observation is that the
transition involves only a subsystem of four normal modes on which the
remaining ones just act as a reservoir. The dynamics of the relevant subsystem
turns out to be Hamiltonian, being governed by an effective potential that
depends on the specific energy of the total system. The effective potential is
actually calculated through time averages. It describes the transition as a
pitchfork bifurcation, and also explains the phenomenon of the soft mode, since
it exhibits a frequency that vanishes at the transition. The critical exponent
too is estimated.

Van der Waals magnetic materials are currently of great interest as materials
for applications in future ultrathin nanoelectronics and nanospintronics. Due
to weak coupling between individual monolayers, these materials can be easily
obtained in the monolayer and bilayer forms. The latter are of specific
interest as they may be considered as natural two-dimensional spin valves. In
this paper, we study theoretically spin waves in bilayers of transition metal
dichalcogenides. The considerations are carried within the general spin wave
theory based on effective spin Hamiltonian and Hollstein-Primakoff-Bogolubov
transformation. The spin Hamiltonian includes intra-layer as well as
inter-layer nearest-neighbour exchange interactions, easy-plane anisotropy, and
additionally a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. The bilayer systems consist
of two ferromagnetic (in-plane magnetization) monolayers that are coupled
either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically. In the latter case, we
analyse the spin wave spectra in all magnetic phases, i.e. in the
antiferromagnetic, spin-flop, and ferromagnetic ones.

Van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional materials have opened up
new frontiers in condensed matter physics, unlocking unexplored possibilities
in electronic and photonic device applications. However, the investigation of
wide-gap high-$\kappa$ layered dielectrics for devices based on van der Waals
structures has been relatively limited. In this work, we demonstrate an easily
reproducible synthesis method for the rare earth oxyhalide LaOBr, and we
exfoliate it as a 2D layered material with a measured static dielectric
constant of $\epsilon_{0, \perp} \simeq 9$ and a wide bandgap of 5.3 eV.
Furthermore, our research demonstrates that LaOBr can be used as a
high-$\kappa$ dielectric in van der Waals field-effect transistors with high
performance and low interface defect concentrations. Additionally, it proves to
be an attractive choice for electrical gating in excitonic devices based on 2D
materials. Our work demonstrates the versatile realization and functionality of
2D systems with wide-gap and high-$\kappa$ van der Waals dielectric
environments.

<br>
The interplay between Coulomb interaction, electron-phonon coupling, and
phonon-phonon coupling has a significant impact on the low-energy behavior of
three-dimensional type-I tilted Dirac semimetals. To investigate this
phenomenon, we construct an effective theory, calculate one-loop corrections
contributed by all these interactions, and establish the coupled
energy-dependent flows of all associated interaction parameters by adopting the
renormalization group approach. Deciphering such coupled evolutions allows us
to determine a series of low-energy critical outcomes for these materials. At
first, we present the low-energy tendencies of all interaction parameters. The
tilting parameter exhibits distinct tendencies that depend heavily upon the
initial anisotropy of fermion velocities. In comparison, the latter is mainly
dominated by its own initial value but less sensitive to the former. With
variance of these two quantities, parts of the interaction parameters are
driven towards the strong anisotropy in the low-energy, indicating the screened
interaction in certain directions, while others tend to move towards an
approximate isotropy. Additionally, we observe that the tendencies of
interaction parameters can be qualitatively clustered into three distinct types
of fixed points, accompanying the potential instabilities around which certain
interaction-driven phase transition is trigged. Furthermore, approaching such
fixed points leads to physical quantities, such as the density of states,
compressibility, and specific heat, exhibiting behavior that is significantly
different from their non-interacting counterparts and even deviates slightly
from Fermi-liquid behavior. Our investigation sheds light on the intricate
relationship between different types of interactions in these semimetals, and
provide useful insights into their fundamental properties.

We analytically calculate the contribution to the local density of states due
to thermal sources in a disk-like patch within the framework of fluctuational
electrodynamics. We further introduce a wavevector cutoff method to approximate
this contribution. We compare the results obtained with the source and cutoff
method with the numerical exact LDOS above a metal disk attained by SCUFF-EM
calculations. By this comparison we highlight the difference and resemblance of
thermal and geometrical boundary conditions which are both relevant for
near-field scanning microscope measurements. Finally, we give an outlook to
general lateral temperature profiles and compare it with surface profiles.

<br>
<br>
Ultrathin, solution-processed emerging solar cells with high power-per-weight
(PPW) outputs demonstrate unique potential for applications where low weight,
high power output, and flexibility are indispensable. The following perspective
explores the literature of emerging PVs and highlights the maximum reported PPW
values of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) 29.4 W/g, Organic Solar Cells (OSCs)
32.07 W/g and Quantum Dot Solar Cells (QDSC) 15.02 W/g, respectively. The
record PPW values of OSCs and PSCs are approximately one order of magnitude
higher compared to their inorganic ultrathin solar cells counterparts (approx.
3.2 W/g for CIGS and a-Si). This consists emerging PVs, very attractive for a
variety of applications where the PPW is the key parameter. In particular, both
OSCs and PSCs can be implemented in different scenarios of applications (indoor
and biocompatible applications for OSCs and outdoor and high-energy radiation
conversion conditions for the PSCs) due to their unique optoelectronic and
physiochemical properties. Finally, our theoretical optical and electrical
simulation and optimization study for the most promising and well-suited PV
technologies, showed an impressive maximum realistic theoretical PPW limit of
74.3 and 93.7 W/g for PSCs and OSCs, respectively. Our finding shows that the
literature PSCs and OSCs towards high PPW outputs, is not quite close to the
theoretical maximum and thus more work needs to be done to further increase the
PPW output of these promising PV technologies.

<h3>A versatile unitary transformation framework for an optimal bath  construction in density-matrix based quantum embedding approaches</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13446" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13446</a>
<br>
<i>Quentin Marécat, Matthieu Saubanère</i>
<br>
<br>
The performance of embedding methods is directly tied to the quality of the
bath orbitals construction. In this paper, we develop a versatile framework,
enabling the investigation of the optimal construction of the orbitals of the
bath. As of today, in state-of-the-art embedding methods, the orbitals of the
bath are constructed by performing a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the
impurity-environment part of the 1RDM, as originally presented in Density
Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET). Recently, the equivalence between the SVD
protocol and the use of unitary transformation, the so-called Block-Householder
transformation, has been established. We present a generalization of the
Block-Householder transformation by introducing additional flexible parameters.
The additional parameters are optimized such that the bath-orbitals fulfill
physically motivated constrains. The efficiency of the approach is discussed
and exemplified in the context of the half-filled Hubbard model in
one-dimension.

<br>
<br>
We report the nonlinear dielectric properties of three triple-perovskite
ruthenates: Ba$_3$CoRu$_2$O$_9$, Ba$_3$BiRu$_2$O$_9$, and Sr$_3$CaRu$_2$O$_9$.
These compounds exhibit notable correlations among their spin, charge, lattice,
and polar degrees of freedom. Ba$_3$CoRu$_2$O$_9$ displays a pronounced
frequency-dependent relaxation in $\chi_{2,3}$ just above the magnetoelastic
transition, occurring around 100K, followed by an abrupt loss of polarization
within the ordered phase. In Ba$_3$BiRu$_2$O$_9$, we encounter the possibility
of multiple coexisting relaxation behaviors, indicating a complex phase
strongly influenced by the spin-gap opening at 175K. Lastly,
Sr$_3$CaRu$_2$O$_9$ displays anomalies with strong dispersion effects close to
its magnetic transitions, pointing to a robust coupling between magnetic and
dipolar orders in the system. These measurements highlight the significance of
higher-order (hyper-)susceptibilities in providing profound insight into the
dynamics of a system, offering information otherwise inaccessible through the
linear polarization response alone.

<h3>Transition from viscous fingers to foam during drainage in heterogeneous  porous media</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13451" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13451</a>
<br>
<i>Federico Lanza, Santanu Sinha, Alex Hansen, Alberto Rosso, Laurent Talon</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the behavior of drainage displacements in heterogeneous porous
media finding a transition from viscous fingering to foam-like region. A pore
network model incorporating the formation of blobs is adopted to study this
phenomenon. By imposing a pressure difference between the inlet and outlet, we
observe that the displacement pattern undergoes a significant transition from a
continuous front of growing viscous fingers to the emergence of foam, which
develops and propagates until breakthrough. This transition occurs at a
specific distance from the inlet, which we measure and analyze as a function of
the viscosity ratio and the capillary number, demonstrating that it follows a
non-trivial power-law decay with both the parameters. Moreover, we discuss the
relationship between the evolution of the total flow rate and the local
pressure drop, showing that the foam developed reduces global mobility. We
observe that foam is formed from the fragmentation of viscous fingers beneath
the front, and this instability mechanism is connected with fluctuations of the
local flow rate, which we analyze both in the viscous fingering region and in
the foam region.

<h3>Dissipation and recovery in collagen fibrils under cyclic loading: a  molecular dynamics study</h3>

<br>
<i>Amir Suhail, Anuradha Banerjee, R. Rajesh</i>
<br>
<br>
The hysteretic behavior exhibited by collagen fibrils, when subjected to
cyclic loading, is known to result in both dissipation as well as accumulation
of residual strain. On subsequent relaxation, partial recovery has also been
reported. Cross-links have been considered to play a key role in overall
mechanical properties. Here, we modify an existing coarse grained molecular
dynamics model for collagen fibril with initially cross-linked collagen
molecules, which is known to reproduce the response to uniaxial strain, by
incorporating reformation of cross-links to allow for possible recovery of the
fibril. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that our model
successfully replicates the key features observed in experimental data,
including the movement of hysteresis loops, the time evolution of residual
strains and energy dissipation, as well as the recovery observed during
relaxation. We also show that the characteristic cycle number, describing the
approach towards steady state, has a value similar to that in experiments. We
also emphasize the vital role of the degree of cross-linking on the key
features of the macroscopic response to cyclic loading.

<br>
<br>
The current challenge to realizing continuously tunable magnetism lies in our
inability to systematically change properties such as valence, spin, and
orbital degrees of freedom as well as crystallographic geometry. Here, we
demonstrate that ferromagnetism can be externally turned on with the
application of low-energy helium implantation and subsequently erased and
returned to the pristine state via annealing. This high level of continuous
control is made possible by targeting magnetic metastability in the ultra-high
conductivity, non-magnetic layered oxide PdCoO2 where local lattice distortions
generated by helium implantation induce emergence of a net moment on the
surrounding transition metal octahedral sites. These highly-localized moments
communicate through the itinerant metal states which triggers the onset of
percolated long-range ferromagnetism. The ability to continuously tune
competing interactions enables tailoring precise magnetic and magnetotransport
responses in an ultra-high conductivity film and will be critical to
applications across spintronics.

<h3>Lattice structure dependence of laser-induced ultrafast magnetization  switching in ferrimagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13522" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13522</a>
<br>
<i>J. A. Vélez, R. M. Otxoa, U. Atxitia</i>
<br>
<br>
The experimental discovery of single-pulse ultrafast magnetization switching
in ferrimagnetic alloys, such as GdFeCo and MnRuGa, opened the door to a
promising route toward faster and more energy efficient data storage. A recent
semi-phenomenological theory has proposed that a fast, laser-induced
demagnetization below a threshold value puts the system into a dynamical regime
where angular momentum transfer between sublattices dominates. Notably, this
threshold scales inversely proportional to the number of exchange-coupled
nearest neighbours considered in the model, which in the simplest case is
directly linked to the underlying lattice structure. In this work, we study the
role of the lattice structure on the laser-induced ultrafast magnetization
switching in ferrimagnets by complementing the phenomenological theory with
atomistic spin dynamics computer simulations. We consider a spin model of the
ferrimagnetic GdFeCo alloy with increasing number of exchange-coupled
neighbours. Within this model, we demonstrate that the laser-induced
magnetization dynamics and switching depends on the lattice structure. Further,
we determine that the critical laser energy for switching reduces for
decreasing number of exchange-coupled neighbours.

<br>
<br>
The microscopic mechanism of heavy band formation, relevant for
unconventional superconductivity in CeCoIn$_5$ and other Ce-based heavy fermion
materials, depends strongly on the efficiency with which $f$ electrons are
delocalized from the rare earth sites and participate in a Kondo lattice.
Replacing Ce$^{3+}$ ($4f^1$, $J=5/2$) with Sm$^{3+}$ ($4f^5$, $J=5/2$), we show
that a combination of crystal field and on-site Coulomb repulsion causes
SmCoIn$_5$ to exhibit a $\Gamma_7$ ground state similar to CeCoIn$_5$ with
multiple $f$ electrons. Remarkably, we also find that with this ground state,
SmCoIn$_5$ exhibits a temperature-induced valence crossover consistent with a
Kondo scenario, leading to increased delocalization of $f$ holes below a
temperature scale set by the crystal field, $T_v$ $\approx$ 60 K. Our result
provides evidence that in the case of many $f$ electrons, the crystal field
remains the most important tuning knob in controlling the efficiency of
delocalization near a heavy fermion quantum critical point, and additionally
clarifies that charge fluctuations play a general role in the ground state of
"115" materials.

In this article, we review different studies based on advanced x-ray
diffraction techniques - especially coherent x-ray diffraction - that allowed
us to reveal the behaviour of such symmetry-breaking systems as Charge Density
Wave (CDW) and Spin density Wave (SDW), through their local phase. After a
brief introduction on the added value of using coherent x-rays, we show how the
method can be applied to CDW and SDW systems, in both static and dynamical
regimes. The approach allowed us to probe the particular sliding state of CDWs
systems by observing them through their phase fluctuations, to which coherent
x-rays are particularly sensitive. Several compounds stabilizing a CDW phase
able to slide are presented, each with a different but clearly pronounced
signature of the sliding state. Two main features emerge from this series of
experiments which have been little treated until now, the influence of CDW
pinning by the sample surfaces and the propagation of periodic phase defects
such as charge solitons across the entire sample. Phase models describing the
spatial and temporal properties of sliding CDWs are presented in the last part
of this review.

A nonperturbative dynamical coupling approach based on tight-binding
molecular dynamics is used to evaluate the electron-ion (electron-phonon)
coupling parameter in irradiated semiconductors as a function of the electronic
temperature up to ~25,000 K. The method accounts for arbitrary electronic
distribution function via the Boltzmann equation, enabling a comparative
analysis of various models: fully equilibrium electronic distribution,
band-resolved local equilibria (distinct temperatures and chemical potential of
electrons in the valence and the conduction band), and a full nonequilibrium
distribution. It is demonstrated that the nonequilibrium produces the
electron-phonon coupling parameter different by at most ~35% from its
equilibrium counterpart for identical deposited energy density, allowing to use
the coupling parameter as a function of the single electronic equivalent (or
kinetic) temperature. The following 14 semiconductors are studied here - group
IV: Si, Ge, SiC; group III-V: AlAs, AlP, GaP, GaAs, GaSb; oxides: ZnO, TiO2,
Cu2O; layered PbI2; ZnS and B4C.

<h3>How massless are Weyl fermions in Weyl semimetals?</h3>

Circularly polarized light fails to generate currents in inversion-symmetric
Weyl semimetals with degenerate Weyl nodes. While each node generates current
with the direction depending on its chirality, the two currents in the two
degenerate nodes of opposite chirality cancel each other. By extension, it is
also generally expected that the currents generated at the same Weyl node by
the fields of opposite helicity should also observe mirror symmetry and cancel.
Surprisingly, here we find that this is not the case. The origin of this effect
lies in the nonlinear energy dispersion, which manifests strongly already very
close to the Weyl nodes, where linear dispersion is expected to hold and the
Weyl fermions are thus expected to be massless. A scheme based on using a
trefoil field composed of a counterrotating fundamental and its second harmonic
is proposed to control the induced asymmetry at a chiral node from positive to
negative, including zero.

Charge density waves (CDW) have been reported in NdNiO$_2$ and LaNiO$_2$ thin
films grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrates using Ni-$L_3$ resonant x-ray scattering in
Refs. [1-3]. In their comment [arXiv:2306.15086] on these reports, Pelliciari
et al. found no evidence for a CDW in a NdNiO$_2$ film by performing
fixed-momentum energy-dependent measurements. Instead, they observed a nearby
non-resonant scattering peak, attributed to the (101) substrate reflection,
made accessible at Ni-$L_3$ due to third harmonic light contamination. Here we
present fixed-momentum energy-dependent resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
measurements across Ni-$L_3$ on NdNiO$_2$, used in the preceding study [1]. We
see intrinsic Ni-$L_3$ energy profiles at all measured \textbf{Q} values,
including a strong resonance effect at $\mathbf{Q}_\mathrm{CDW} = (-1/3, 0,
0.316)$ reciprocal lattice units. Attempts to measure the (101) substrate peak
using third harmonic light at Ni-$L_3$ at I21, Diamond were unfruitful. Our
results clearly demonstrate the electronic origin of the scattering peak
published in Ref. [1] and lack of a detectable structural component in the
peak.

In a magnetic field, vortices significantly contribute to the dark counts of
single-photon detectors made of superconducting wires, and they are also
limiting the critical current of such devices. To address this issue, we
prepared superconducting microwires with a pinhole grid from WSi thin films and
report on corresponding critical-current and count-rate measurements in an
external magnetic field B. When compared to corresponding devices without
pinholes, the critical current only weakly depends on the magnetic field at B <
16 mT and it is even larger already at B > 10 mT. Moreover, dark counts are not
only suppressed in zero field, but particularly in magnetic fields B < 16 mT,
while photon counts are virtually field insensitive in the same range of the
magnetic field.

<br>
<br>
The rapid design of advanced materials is a topic of great scientific
interest. The conventional, ``forward'' paradigm of materials design involves
evaluating multiple candidates to determine the best candidate that matches the
target properties. However, recent advances in the field of deep learning have
given rise to the possibility of an ``inverse'' design paradigm for advanced
materials, wherein a model provided with the target properties is able to find
the best candidate. Being a relatively new concept, there remains a need to
systematically evaluate how these two paradigms perform in practical
applications. Therefore, the objective of this study is to directly,
quantitatively compare the forward and inverse design modeling paradigms. We do
so by considering two case studies of refractory high-entropy alloy design with
different objectives and constraints and comparing the inverse design method to
other forward schemes like localized forward search, high throughput screening,
and multi objective optimization.

We derive a widely-applicable first principles approach for determining
two-body, static effective interactions for low-energy Hamiltonians with
quantitative accuracy. The algebraic construction rigorously conserves all
instantaneous two-point correlation functions in a chosen model space at the
level of the random phase approximation, improving upon the traditional
uncontrolled static approximations. Applied to screened interactions within a
quantum embedding framework, we demonstrate these faithfully describe the
relaxation of local subspaces via downfolding high-energy physics in molecular
systems, as well as enabling a systematically improvable description of the
long-range plasmonic contributions in extended graphene.

Van der Waals interactions are ubiquitous and they play an important role for
the stability of materials. Current understanding of this type of coupling is
based on linear response theory, while optical nonlinearities are rarely
considered in this context. Many materials, however, exhibit strong optical
nonlinear response, which prompts further evaluation of dispersive forces
beyond linear response. Here we present a $\textit{Discrete Coupled Nonlinear
Dipole}$ approach that takes into account linear and nonlinear properties of
all dipolar nanoparticles in a given system. This method is based on a
Hamiltonian for nonlinear dipoles, which we apply in different systems
uncovering a complex interplay of distance, anisotropy, polarizibilities, and
hyperpolarizabilities in the vdW energy. This investigation broadens our basic
understanding of dispersive interactions, especially in the context of
nonlinear materials.

Antiferromagnetic (AF) materials are attracting increasing interest of
research in magnetic physics and spintronics. Here, we report controllable
synthesis of room-temperature AF $\alpha$-MnTe nanocrystals (N\'eel temperature
~ 307 K) via molten-salt-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The growth
kinetics are investigated regarding the dependence of flake dimension and
macroscopic shape on growth time and temperature. The high crystalline quality
and atomic structure are confirmed by various crystallographic characterization
means. Cryogenic magneto-transport measurements reveal anisotropic
magnetoresistance (MR) response and a complicated dependence of MR on
temperature, owing to the subtle competition among multiple scattering
mechanisms of thermally excited magnetic disorders (magnon drag), magnetic
transition and thermally populated lattice phonons. Overall positive MR
behavior with twice transitions in magnitude is observed when out-of-plane
external magnetic field ($B$) is applied, while a transition from negative to
positive MR response is recorded when in-plane $B$ is applied. The rich
magnetic transport properties render $\alpha$-MnTe a promising material for
exploiting functional components in magnetic devices.

The phase transition behavior and charge storage mechanism of Pr$_2$MgZrO$_6$

following the sequence 14 to 87 to 225. High temperature Raman spectroscopy
demonstrated a significant feature of a monoclinic to tetragonal phase

semiconductor to metal transition in PMM. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of
the Mn 2p state confirmed the presence of oxygen vacancies in PMM at room
temperature. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of PMM as an
electrode was evaluated. The PMM electrode displayed an intercalated
pseudocapacitive nature, exhibiting a maximum possible specific capacitance of

The ac electrical transport properties of polycrystalline Pr$_2$MgZrO$_6$
(PMZ) have been investigated using conductivity and impedance spectroscopic
techniques. The crystal structure of PMZ has been determined to be monoclinic
through a combination of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies. Ag
mode in the Raman spectra has been identified as the breathing vibration of the
ZrO6 octahedra. The ac conductivity spectra of PMZ exhibit distinct
characteristics at different temperature ranges. At lower temperatures (less
than 420 K), the spectra are fitted using a double power law, indicating the
involvement of multiple microstructural features. On the other hand, at higher
temperatures (greater than 460 K), the spectra follow Jonscher's law,
suggesting a simpler conduction mechanism. Through the analysis of
conductivity, permittivity, and impedance, an insulator-metal transition has
been observed around 452 K. This transition signifies a significant change in
the electrical properties of PMZ and provides valuable insights into its
conductive nature.

We introduce a pseudo-spin model for the argentophilic bond expected in
silver-based bilayered materials arising from a spontaneous pseudo-magnetic
field interacting with pseudo-spins of two unconventional Ag ions, namely $\rm
Ag^{2+}$ and $\rm Ag^{1-}$ electronically distinct from (\textit{albeit}
energetically degenerate to) the conventional $\rm Ag^{1+}$ cation typically
observed in monolayered materials. This model suggests the possibility of
tuning the dimensionality and hence the conductor-semiconductor-insulator
properties of honeycomb layered materials by application of external electric
and magnetic fields, analogous to driving a superconducting system to the
normal regime by critical electric and magnetic fields.

Vanishing of the total angular momentum of the electrons occupying all
orbitals of a closed shell in an atom is a textbook fact. Understanding the
symmetry content of the atomic shell as irreducible representation of angular
momentum, enables straightforward transfer of the notion to (translational or
helically) periodic systems. More relevant generalizations naturally appear:
stratum shell is intermediate step to physically sound band representations,
including elementary and basic ones and connected components. We show that
nontrivial determinant representation indicates stable topology of band in
single colorless layer groups and obstructive limit in in single colorless line
groups.

Motivated by the recently discovered incompressible insulating phase in the
bilayer graphene exciton experiment [arXiv:2306.16995], we study using
bosonization two Coulomb-coupled spinless quantum wires and examine the
possibility of realizing the similar phenomenology in one dimension. We explore
the possible phases as functions of $k_{F}$'s and interactions. We show that an
incompressible insulating phase can arise for two lightly doped electron-hole
quantum wires (i.e., $k_{F1}=-k_{F2}$ and small $|k_{F1}|$) due to strong
interwire interactions. Such an insulating phase forms a parity-even
wire-antisymmetric charge density wave without interwire phase coherence, which
melts to a phase allowing for a perfect negative drag upon heating. The
finite-temperature response is qualitatively consistent with the ``exciton
solid'' phenomenology in the bilayer graphene exciton experiment, providing a
potential explanation for the observed correlated insulating phase.
