<h3>Optimal active particle navigation meets machine learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05558" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05558</a>
<br>

The question of how "smart" active agents, like insects, microorganisms, or
future colloidal robots need to steer to optimally reach or discover a target,
such as an odor source, food, or a cancer cell in a complex environment has
recently attracted great interest. Here, we provide an overview of recent
developments, regarding such optimal navigation problems, from the micro- to
the macroscale, and give a perspective by discussing some of the challenges
which are ahead of us. Besides exemplifying an elementary approach to optimal
navigation problems, the article focuses on works utilizing machine
learning-based methods. Such learning-based approaches can uncover highly
efficient navigation strategies even for problems that involve e.g. chaotic,
high-dimensional, or unknown environments and are hardly solvable based on
conventional analytical or simulation methods.

<h3>First order alignment transition in an interfaced active nematic</h3>

We investigate experimentally the dynamic phase transition of a
two-dimensional active nematic layer interfaced with a passive liquid crystal.
Under a temperature ramp that leads to the transition of the passive liquid
into a highly anisotropic lamellar smectic-A phase, and in the presence of a
magnetic field, the coupled active nematic reorganizes its flow and
orientational patterns from the turbulent into a quasi-laminar regime aligned
perpendicularly to the field. Remarkably, while the phase transition of the
passive fluid is known to be continuous, our observations reveal intermittent
dynamics of the order parameter and the coexistence of aligned and turbulent
regions in the active nematic, a signature of discontinuous, or first order,
phase transitions.

<h3>Coastal Kelvin Mode and The Fractional Quantum Hall Edge</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05669</a>

This letter explores the relationship between the coastal Kelvin mode
observed in the shallow water model of ocean waves and the edge mode of a
fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state. The hydrodynamic equations for the FQH
state can be written as a generalized form of the shallow water equations with
Coriolis force, where the density replaces the height of the fluid column and
the magnetic field plays the role of the Coriolis parameter. In the FQH case,
the potential vorticity associated with the shallow water model becomes a
constant. In contrast to the shallow water equations, the hydro system for the
FQH state contains higher derivatives of velocity which enforces the no-stress
boundary condition in addition to the no-penetration condition at the hard wall
or coastal boundary. For these boundary conditions, the linearized edge
dynamics has two chiral edge modes propagating in the same direction: a
non-dispersing Kelvin mode and a dispersing chiral boson mode. We investigate
the nature of these modes in the presence of the tangent electric field. We
show that the Kelvin mode does not couple to the electric field and cannot
transport charge. However, the dispersive chiral boson mode is consistent with
the edge dynamics of the FQH state and satisfies the anomaly equation.

<h3>Dynamic Exchange Coupling between Magnets Mediated by Attenuating  Elastic Waves</h3>

Coupling between spatially separated magnets can be mediated by excitations
such as photons and phonons, which can be characterized as coherent coupling
and dissipative coupling with real and imaginary coupling rate. We
theoretically predict the existence of dynamic exchange coupling in a closed
magneto-elastic system mediated by attenuating elastic waves and whose coupling
rate is complex in general, leading to alternating repulsive or attractive
spectrum depending on thickness of the elastic media. The presence of dynamic
exchange coupling and its competition with coherent coupling are numerically
verified according to the generalized Hooke's law in magneto-elastic systems.
The predicted mechanism provides a new strategy to synchronize precessing
magnets as well as other excitations over long distance and pave the way for
non-Hermitian engineering of collective modes in hybrid magnonics, phononics
and photonics.

<h3>Nonequilibrium diffusion of active particles bound to a semi-flexible  polymer network: simulations and fractional Langevin equation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05851" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05851</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
In a viscoelastic environment, the diffusion of a particle becomes
non-Markovian due to the memory effect. An open question is to quantitatively
explain how self-propulsion particles with directional memory diffuse in such a
medium. Based on simulations and analytic theory, we address this issue with
active viscoelastic systems where an active particle is connected with multiple
semi-flexible filaments. Our Langevin dynamics simulations show that the active
cross-linker displays super- and sub-diffusive athermal motion with a
time-dependent anomalous exponent $\alpha$. In such viscoelastic feedback, the
active particle always has superdiffusion with $\alpha=3/2$ at times shorter
than the self-propulsion time ($\tau_A$). At times greater than $\tau_A$, the
subdiffusion emerges with $\alpha$ bounded between $1/2$ and $3/4$. Remarkably,
the active subdiffusion is reinforced as the active propulsion (Pe) is more
vigorous. In the high-Pe limit, the athermal fluctuation in the stiff filament
eventually leads to $\alpha=1/2$, which can be misinterpreted with the thermal
Rouse motion in a flexible chain. We demonstrate that the motion of active
particles cross-linking a network of semi-flexible filaments can be governed by
a fractional Langevin equation combined with fractional Gaussian noise and an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. We analytically derive the velocity autocorrelation
function and mean-squared displacement of the model, explaining their scaling
relations as well as the prefactors. We find that there exist the threshold Pe
($\mathrm{Pe}^*$) and cross-over times ($\tau^*$ and $\tau^\dagger$) above
which the active viscoelastic dynamics emerge on the timescales of $\tau^*
\lesssim t \lesssim \tau^\dagger$. Our study may provide a theoretical insight
into various nonequilibrium active dynamics in intracellular viscoelastic
environments.

<h3>Three-Dimensional Damage Characterisation in Dual Phase Steel using Deep  Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05869" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05869</a>

High performance sheet metals with a multi-phase microstructure suffer from
deformation induced damage formation during forming in the constituent phases
but importantly also where these intersect. To capture damage in terms of the
physical processes in three dimensions (3D) and its stochastic nature during
deformation, two challenges remain to be tackled: First, bridging high
resolution analysis towards large scales to consider statistical data and,
second, characterising in 3D with a resolution appropriate for sub-micron sized
voids at a large scale. Here, we present how this can be achieved using
panoramic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metallographic serial sectioning,
and deep-learning assisted automatic image analysis. This brings together the
3D evolution of active damage mechanisms with volumetric and environmental
information for thousands of individual damage sites. We also assess potential
surface preparation artefacts in 2D analyses. Overall, we find that for the
material considered here, a dual phase (DP800) steel, martensite cracking is
the dominant but not sole origin of deformation induced damage and that for a
quantitative comparison of damage density, metallographic preparation can
induce additional surface damage density far exceeding what is commonly induced
between uniaxial straining steps.

<h3>Return of the phonons: Planckian scattering emerges from vibronic  dynamics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06077" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06077</a>
<br>
<i>Alhun Aydin, Donghwan Kim, Joonas Keski-Rahkonen, Eric J. Heller</i>
<br>

Strange metals exhibit universal linear-in-temperature resistivity described
by the Planckian scattering rate, the origin of which was not previously
understood. It was thought that phonons were disqualified as a prime agent, in
spite of their predominance in many other resistivity contexts. The problem
seems to have been not with phonons, but how they were treated. Here we show
that Planckian resistivity can in fact emerge from the \textit{nonperturbative}
scattering dynamics of thermal lattice vibrations and \textit{coherent} charge
carriers. This becomes apparent when describing the lattice vibrations in the
coherent state representation, and treating charge carriers as quantum wave
packets negotiating the resulting active deformation potential by a
wave-on-wave approach. Under this coherent and nonperturbative scattering
dynamics, we find that carrier velocities are suppressed, the quasiparticle
picture breaks down and a new phase called the vibronic fluid emerges. A
competition between the static and dynamic aspects of the random acoustic
deformation potential is set up, leading a previously conjectured quantum bound
of diffusion $\hbar/m^{*}$ with universal properties. We successfully obtain
the $T$-linear resistivity of three different cuprates using their experimental
parameters in our numerical simulations. We explain the underlying mechanism
for the Planckian scattering based on the phenomenological model of Thouless
scaling theory. Furthermore, we provide explanations for the violation of the
Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit as well as the emergence of the displaced Drude peak in
strange metals.

<h3>Simple and accurate screening parameters for dielectric-dependent  hybrids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05549" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05549</a>

A simple effective screening parameter for screened range-separated hybrid is
constructed from the compressibility sum rule in the context of linear-response
time-dependent Density Functional Theory. When applied to the
dielectric-dependent hybrid (DDH), it becomes remarkably accurate for bulk
solids compared to those obtained from fitting with the model dielectric
function or depending on the valence electron density of materials. The present
construction of the screening parameter is simple and realistic. The screening
parameter developed in this way is physically appealing and practically useful
as it is straightforward to obtain using the average over the unit cell volume
of the bulk solid, bypassing high-level calculations of the dielectric function
depending on random-phase approximation. Furthermore, we have obtained a very
good accuracy for energy band gaps, positions of the occupied d-bands,
ionization potentials, optical properties of semiconductors and insulators, and
geometries of bulk solids (equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli) from
the constructed DDH.

<h3>Atomic resolution mapping of localized phonon modes at grain boundaries</h3>

<br>

Phonon scattering at grain boundaries (GBs) is significant in controlling
nanoscale device thermal conductivity. However, GBs could also act as
waveguides for selected modes. To measure localized GB phonon modes, meV energy
resolution is needed with sub-nm spatial resolution. Using monochromated
electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron
microscope (STEM) we have mapped the 60 meV optic mode across GBs in silicon at
atomic resolution and compared it to calculated phonon densities of states
(DOS). The intensity is strongly reduced at GBs characterised by the presence
of five- and seven-fold rings where bond angles differ from the bulk. The
excellent agreement between theory and experiment strongly supports the
existence of localized phonon modes and thus of GBs acting as waveguides.

<h3>Off-stoichiometric softening and polytypic transformations in the  plastic deformation of the C14 Fe$_2$Nb Laves phase</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05553</a>

<br>
<br>
Plastic deformation of the brittle C14-Fe$_2$Nb Laves phase occurs mostly by
basal slip due to the complex crystal structure. Here, we compare the barriers
for basal slip for the known mechanisms of direct slip, synchroshear and
undulating slip using density functional theory calculations. According to our
calculated generalized stacking fault (SF) energies, the most favorable
mechanisms are synchroshear and undulating slip. Both mechanisms lead to stable
SF with a formation energy of 50 $mJ/m^2$ through the same unstable SF
configuration at the transition. The energy barrier of approximately 3 $J/m^2$
indicates a low dislocation mobility as expected from the brittle character. We
also determine the influence of vacancies and antisite defects on the formation
energy of stable and unstable SF. Both kinds of point defects tend to lower the
energy barrier on both sides of 2:1 stoichiometry. This explains the
experimentally observed off-stoichiometric softening of C14-Fe$_2$Nb. The small
energy differences between the Fe$_2$Nb Laves phase polytypes raises the
question if there are further deformation mechanisms with low barrier.
Therefore, we additionally consider transformations between C14, C15 and C36
Laves phases as further deformation mechanism. Our calculations for polytypic
transformations by successive synchroshear steps show that the corresponding
energy barriers are in fact very similar to the energy barrier for basal slip
in C14. This suggests that the energy needed to create a stable SF in C14 by
synchroshear is also sufficient to initiate polytypic transformations where
existing SFs in C14 are further transformed to form C15 or C36 Laves phases.

Layered antiferromagnetic materials have emerged as a novel subset of the
two-dimensional family providing a highly accessible regime with prospects for
layer-number-dependent magnetism. Furthermore, transition metal phosphorous
trichalcogenides, MPX3 (M = transition metal; X = chalcogen) provide a platform
for investigating fundamental interactions between magnetic and lattice degrees
of freedom providing new insights for developing fields of spintronics and
magnonics. Here, we use a combination of temperature dependent Raman
spectroscopy and density functional theory to explore
magnetic-ordering-dependent interactions between the manganese spin degree of
freedom and lattice vibrations of the non-magnetic sub-lattice via a
Kramers-Anderson super-exchange pathway in both bulk, and few-layer, manganese
phosphorous triselenide (MnPSe$_3$). We observe a nonlinear temperature
dependent shift of phonon modes predominantly associated with the non-magnetic
sub-lattice, revealing their non-trivial spin-phonon coupling below the
N{\'e}el temperature at 74 K, allowing us to extract mode-specific spin-phonon
coupling constants.

At the 2D limit, hexagonal systems such as monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene exhibit unique coupled spin and
momentum-valley physics (valley pseudospin) owing to broken spatial inversion
symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. Circularly polarized light provides
the means for pseudospin-selective excitation of excitons (or electrons and
holes) and can yield momentum-valley polarized populations of carriers that are
the subject of proposed valleytronic applications. The chirality of these
excited carriers have important consequences for the available
relaxation/scattering pathways, which must conserve (pseudo)angular momentum as
well as energy. One available relaxation channel that satisfies these
constraints is coupling to chiral phonons. Here we show that chiral
carrier-phonon coupling following valley-polarized photoexcitation is expected
to leads to a strongly valley-polarized chiral phonon distribution that is
directly measurable using ultrafast phonon-diffuse scattering techniques. Using
ab-initio calculations we show how the dynamic phonon occupations and valley
anisotropy determined by nonequilibrium observations can provide a new window
on the physical processes that drive carrier valley-depolarization in monolayer
TMDs.

The extremely low temperatures have limited the availability and accuracy of
experimental thermophysical property measurements for cryogens, particularly
transport properties. Traditional scaling techniques such as corresponding
states theory have long been known to be inaccurate for fluids with strong
quantum effects. To address this need, this paper investigates how quantum
effects impact thermodynamics and momentum transfer (shear viscosity) in the
fluid phases of hydrogen, deuterium, and neon. We utilize experimental
viscosity measurements and reference empirical equations of state to show that
conventional entropy scaling is inadequate for quantum-dominated systems. We
then provide a simple empirical correction to entropy scaling based on the
ratio of quantum to packing length scale that accounts for the deviations.

<h3>Symmetry, spin and orbital character of a van-Hove singularity in  proximity to a Lifshitz transition in Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</h3>

The physics of strongly correlated electron materials is often governed by
Van Hove singularities (VHss) in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The
divergence of the density of states generated by the VHss can promote
electron-electron interactions and the emergence of new phases such as
superconductivity, ferromagnetism, metamagnetism, nematicity and density wave
orders. The shape and intensity of this divergence depends sensitively on the
order and symmetry of the VHs, and hence a detailed understanding of the
low-energy electronic structure is essential to understand the role of VHss in
emergent phases. A family of materials with a large diversity of emergent
phases that can be related to VHss close to the Fermi energy is the
Ruddlesden-Popper series of the strontium ruthenates. Here we study the
low-energy electronic structure at the surface of ferromagnetic
Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at
millikelvin temperatures. We identify multiple VHss close to the Fermi energy
and establish their spin character. Using quasiparticle interference we extract
the orbital character and symmetry of the VHs closest to the Fermi energy,
enabling us to identify a new mechanism for a field-induced Lifshitz transition
facilitated by spin-orbit coupling as the origin of the metamagnetic behaviour
in Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$.

<h3>The effect of bias current configuration on the performance of SQUID  arrays</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05609" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05609</a>

Designing superconducting electronic devices involves a careful study of all
the elements in the circuit, including the superconducting bias leads, however,
the effect of the bias current leads on the performance of the device have not
been previously addressed. In this work, we introduce a theoretical model for
two-dimensional superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) arrays
capable of simulating the response of devices with different bias current
configurations. First, we compare uniformly biased and centre biased SQUID
arrays by investigating the voltage versus magnetic flux response, maximum
transfer function and voltage modulation depth. Then, we calculate the
time-averaged fluxoid distributions for 1D and 2D centre biased arrays.
Finally, we study the performance of the two bias current configurations
depending on array size, screening parameter, thermal noise strength and
kinetic self-inductance fraction. Our calculations reveal: (i) centre biased 1D
parallel SQUID arrays present an unusual voltage response caused by the
asymmetric fluxoid distribution; (ii) the optimal transfer function of centre
biased arrays strongly depends on the number of junctions in parallel; (iii)
the performance of centre biased arrays approaches the uniform biased ones when
the number of junctions in series exceeds those in parallel; (iv) while the
screening parameter and the thermal noise strength clearly affect the device
performance, the kinetic self-inductance fraction seems to play only a
secondary role.

<h3>Quantum oscillations and three-dimensional quantum Hall effect in  ZrTe$_5$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05637" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05637</a>

<br>

Recent experiments have reported a lot of spectacular transport properties in
topological materials, such as quantum oscillations and three-dimensional (3D)
quantum Hall effect (QHE) in ZrTe$_5$. In this paper, by using a strong
topological insulator model to describe ZrTe$_5$, we study the magnetotransport
property of the 3D system. With fixed carrier density, we find that there
exists a deferring effect in the chemical potential, which favors
distinguishing the saddle points of the inverted LLs. On the other hand, with
fixed chemical potential, the features of 3D QHE are demonstrated and we
attribute the underlying mechanisms to the interplay between Dirac fermions,
magnetic field and impurity scatterings.

<h3>Electronic states in quantum wires on the Möbius strip</h3>

<br>
In this work, we study the properties of an electron constrained on wires
along the M\"{o}bius strip. We considered wires around the strip and along the
transverse direction, across the width of the strip. For each direction, we
investigate how the curvature modifies the electronic states and their
corresponding energy spectrum. At the center of the strip, the wires around the
surface form quantum rings whose spectrum depends on the strip radius $a$. For
wires at the edge of the strip, the inner edge turns into the outer edge.
Accordingly, the curvature yields localized states in the middle of the wire.
Along the strip width, the effective potential exhibits a parity symmetry
breaking leading to the localization of the bound state on one side of the
strip.

<h3>Single-Step Synthesis of Shape-Controlled Polymeric Particles using  Initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition in Liquid Crystals</h3>

The ability to synthesize shape-controlled polymer particles will benefit a
wide range of applications including targeted drug delivery and metamaterials
with reconfigurable structures, but existing synthesis approaches are commonly
multistep and limited to a narrow size/shape range. Using a novel single-step
synthesis technique, a variety of shapes including nanospheres, hemispherical
micro-domes, orientation-controlled microgels, microspheres, spheroids, and
micro-discs were obtained. The shape-controlled particles were synthesized by
polymerizing divinylbenzene (DVB) via initiated chemical vapor deposition
(iCVD) in nematic liquid crystals (LC). iCVD continuously and precisely
delivered vapor-phase reactants, thus avoiding disruption of the LC structure,
a critical limitation in past LC-templated polymerization. That shape
controllability was further enabled by leveraging LC as a real-time display of
the polymerization conditions and progression, using a custom in-situ
long-focal range microscope. Detailed image analysis unraveled key mechanisms
in polymer synthesis in LC. Poor solubilization by nematic LC led to the
formation of pDVB nanospheres, distinct from microspheres obtained in isotropic
solvents. The nanospheres precipitated to the LC-solid interface and further
aggregated into microgel clusters with controlled orientation that was guided
by the LC molecular alignment. On further polymerization, microgel clusters
phase separated to form microspheres, spheroids, and unique disc-shaped
particles.

Quantum materials, particularly Dirac materials with linearly dispersing
bands, can be effectively tuned by strain-induced lattice distortions leading
to a pseudo-magnetic field that strongly modulates their electronic properties.
Here, we grow kagome magnet FeSn films, consisting of alternatingly stacked
Sn$_2$ honeycomb (stanene) and Fe$_3$Sn kagome layers, on SrTiO$_3$(111)
substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. Using scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy, we show that the Sn honeycomb layer can be
periodically deformed by epitaxial strain for film thickness below 10 nm,
resulting in differential conductance peaks consistent with Landau levels
generated by a pseudo-magnetic field greater than 1000 T. Our findings
demonstrate the feasibility of strain engineering the electronic properties of
topological magnets at the nanoscale.

<h3>Phonon-mediated spin dynamics in a two-electron double quantum dot under  a phonon temperature gradient</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have theoretically studied phonon-mediated spin-flip processes of
electrons in a GaAs double quantum dot (DQD) holding two spins, under a phonon
temperature gradient over the DQD. Transition rates of inter-dot
phonon-assisted tunnel processes and intra-dot spin-flip processes involving
spin triplet states are formalized by the electron-phonon interaction
accompanied with the spin-orbit interaction. The calculations of the spin-flip
rates and the occupation probabilities of the spin-states in the two-electron
DQD with respect to the phonon temperature difference between the dots are
quantitatively consistent with our previous experiment. This theoretical study
on the temperature gradient effect onto spins in coupled QDs would be essential
for understanding spin-related thermodynamic physics.

<h3>Characteristic time of transition from write error to retention error in  voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random-access memory</h3>

<br>
<br>
Voltage controlled magnetoresistive random access memory (VC MRAM) is a
promising candidate for a future low-power high-density memory. The main causes
of bit errors in VC MRAM are write error and retention error. As the size of
the memory cell decreases, the data retention time decreases, which causes a
transition from the write-error-dominant region to the retention-error-dominant
region at a certain operating time. Here we introduce the characteristic time
of the transition from the write-error-dominant region to the
retention-error-dominant region and analyze how the characteristic time depends
on the effective anisotropy constant, $K_{0}$. The characteristic time is
approximately expressed as $t_{\rm c} = 2\, w\, \tau$, where $w$ is the write
error rate, and $\tau$ is the relaxation time derived by Kalmkov [J. Appl.
Phys. 96, (2004) 1138-1145]. We show that for large $K_{0}$, $t_{\rm c}$
increases with increase of $K_{0}$ similar to $\tau$. The characteristic time
is a key parameter for designing the VC MRAM for the variety of applications
such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

We study the electronic structure of electron-doped
Pr$_{1.3-x}$La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (PLCCO ; $T_{c}$ = 27 K, x = 0.1) and
hole-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212 ; $T_{c}$ = 90 K) cuprate
superconductors using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant
photoemission spectroscopy (Res-PES). From Res-PES across the O K-edge and Cu
L-edge, we identify the O 2p and Cu 3d partial density of states (PDOS) and
their correlation satellites which originate in two-hole Auger final states.
Using the Cini-Sawatzky method, analysis of the experimental O 2p PDOS shows an
oxygen on-site Coulomb energy for PLCCO to be $U_{p}$ = 3.3$\pm$0.5 eV and for
Bi2212, $U_{p}$ = 5.6$\pm$0.5 eV, while the copper on-site Coulomb correlation
energy, $U_{d}$ = 6.5$\pm$0.5 eV for Bi2212. The expression for the Heisenberg
exchange interaction $J$ in terms of the electronic parameters $U_{d}$,
$U_{p}$, charge-transfer energy $\Delta$ and Cu-O hopping $t_{pd}$ obtained
from a simple Cu$_2$O cluster model is used to carry out an optimization
analysis consistent with $J$ known from scattering experiments. The analysis
also provides the effective one band on-site Coulomb correlation energy
$\tilde{U}$ and the effective hopping $\tilde{t}$. PLCCO and Bi2212 are shown
to exhibit very similar values of $\tilde{U}$/$\tilde{t}$ $\sim$9-10,
confirming the strongly correlated nature of the singlet ground state in the
effective one-band model for both the materials.

Finding the optimal model complexity that minimizes the generalization error
(GE) is a key issue of machine learning. For the conventional supervised
learning, this task typically involves the bias-variance tradeoff: lowering the
bias by making the model more complex entails an increase in the variance.
Meanwhile, little has been studied about whether the same tradeoff exists for
unsupervised learning. In this study, we propose that unsupervised learning
generally exhibits a two-component tradeoff of the GE, namely the model error
and the data error -- using a more complex model reduces the model error at the
cost of the data error, with the data error playing a more significant role for
a smaller training dataset. This is corroborated by training the restricted
Boltzmann machine to generate the configurations of the two-dimensional Ising
model at a given temperature and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion
process with given entry and exit rates. Our results also indicate that the
optimal model tends to be more complex when the data to be learned are more
complex.

<br>
<br>
Metal superhydrides such as CaH6, YH9 and LaH10 et. al., show a good
potential to achieve room-temperature superconductivity and have been studied
intensively in the past decade. With the help of diverse crystal structure
prediction (CSP) methods, structures of binary superhydrides MHn with varying
metals across the periodic table and many compositions up to n=24 have been
thoroughly searched, and their properties and superconductivity thoroughly
studied, without bringing any unexpected breakthrough. While the usual chemical
space spanned by the integer H/M ratios n has almost been exhausted and many
ternary superhydrides, consisting of two metals, have also been explored, there
are large areas in the composition space that have not been systematically
explored. For example, no explicit rule excludes a non-integer H/M ratio in the
binary. However, a thorough structure search of MxHy, as well as ternary
superhydrides, is a tremendous task and cannot reach the extent of the study of
binary superhydrides with current CSP methods. Based on our recent template
theory that explains the stability of metal superhydrides as the result of a
"template effect" of metal lattices, we conducted a systematic search of MxHy
and ternary superhydrides in two steps including the identification of the
efficient templates and the assembly of superhydrides. With the help of this
method, we identified many new superhydrides, including more than 30 complex
clathrate superhydrides, many have more than 50 atoms in the primitive cell.
The method also shows good potential to search ternary superhydrides in large
scale.

The recent discovery of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic
materials has provided new, unprecedented opportunities for both fundamental
science and technological applications. Unlike three-dimensional (3D) magnetic
systems, the electric manipulation of vdW magnetism (e.g., magnetization state,
magnetic anisotropy, magnetic ordering temperature) down to the monolayer limit
at ambient conditions enables high efficiency operation and low energy
consumption, which has the potential to revolutionize the fields of
spintronics, spin-caloritronics, and valleytronics. This article provides an
in-depth analysis of the recent progress, emerging opportunities, and technical
challenges in the electric manipulation of magnetic functionalities of a wide
variety of 2D vdW magnetic systems ranging from metals to semiconductors and
heterostructures. The state-of-the-art understanding of the mechanisms behind
the electric modulation of magnetism in these 2D vdW magnetic systems will
drive future research towards novel applications in spintronics,
spin-caloritronics, valleytronics, and quantum computation.

A two dimensional topological insulator exhibits helical edge states
topologically protected against single particle backscattering. Such protection
breaks down, however, when electron electron interactions are significant or
when edge reconstruction occurs, leading to suppressed density of states (DOS)
at Fermi level that follows universal scaling with temperature and energy,
characteristic of Tomonaga Luttinger liquid (TLL). Here, we grow multilayer
FeSe on SrTiO3 by molecular beam epitaxy, and observe robust edge states at
both {100}Se and {110}Se steps using scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy. We determine the DOS follows a power law, resulting in
Luttinger parameter K of 0.26 +/- 0.02 and 0.43 +/- 0.07 for {100}Se and
{110}Se edges, respectively. The smaller K for the {100}Se edge also indicates
strong correlations, attributed to ferromagnetic ordering likely present due to
checkerboard antiferromagnetic fluctuations in FeSe. These results demonstrate
TLL in FeSe helical edge channels, providing an exciting model system for novel
topological excitations arising from superconductivity and interacting helical
edge states.

Artificially engineered 2D materials offer unique physical properties for
thermal management, surpassing naturally occurring materials. Here, using van
der Waals epitaxy, we demonstrate the ability to engineer extremely insulating
ultra-thin thermal metamaterials based on crystalline lattice-mismatched
Bi2Se3/MoSe2 superlattices and graphene/PdSe2 heterostructures with exceptional
thermal resistances (70-202 m^2K/GW) and ultralow cross-plane thermal
conductivities (0.01-0.07 Wm^-1K^-1) at room temperature, comparable to those
of amorphous materials. Experimental data obtained using frequency-domain
thermoreflectance and low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, supported by
tight-binding phonon calculations, reveal the impact of lattice mismatch,
phonon-interface scattering, size effects, temperature and interface thermal
resistance on cross-plane heat dissipation, uncovering different thermal
transport regimes and the dominant role of long-wavelength phonons. Our
findings provide essential insights into emerging synthesis and thermal
characterization methods and valuable guidance for the development of
large-area heteroepitaxial van der Waals films of dissimilar materials with
tailored thermal transport characteristics.

Three-dimensional magnetic metamaterials feature interesting phenomena that
arise from a delicate interplay of material properties, local anisotropy,
curvature, and connectivity. A particularly interesting magnetic lattice that
combines these aspects is that of nanoscale gyroids, with a
highly-interconnected chiral network with local three-connectivity reminiscent
of three-dimensional artificial spin ices. Here, we use finite-element
micromagnetic simulations to elucidate the anisotropic behaviour of nanoscale
nickel gyroid networks at applied fields and at remanence. We simplify the
description of the micromagnetic spin states with a macrospin model to explain
the anistropic global response, to quantify the extent of ice-like
correlations, and to discuss qualitative features of the anisotropic
magnetoresistance in the three-dimensional network. Our results demonstrate the
large variability of the magnetic order in extended gyroid networks, which
might enable future spintronic functionalities, including neuromorphic
computing and non-reciprocal transport.

<br>

We study the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in tilted Weyl metals with Gaussian
disorder due to the crossed X and {\Psi} diagrams in this work. The importance
of such diagrams to the AHE has been demonstrated recently in 2D massive Dirac
model and Rashba ferromagnets. It was shown that the inclusion of such diagrams
dramatically changes the total AHE in such systems. In this work, we show that
the contributions from the X and {\Psi} diagrams to the AHE in tilted Weyl
metals are of the same order of the non-crossing diagram we studied in a
previous work, but with opposite sign. The total contribution of the X and
{\Psi} diagrams cancels the majority of the contribution from the non-crossing
diagram in tilted Weyl metals, similar to the 2D massive Dirac model. We also
discussed the difference of the contributions from the crossed diagrams between
2D massive Dirac model and the tilted Weyl metals. At last, we discussed the
experimental relevance of observing the AHE due to the X and {\Psi} diagrams in
type-I Weyl metal Co3Sn2S2.

We show that the chiral modes in circular graphene $pn$ junctions provide an
advantage for spin manipulation via spin-orbit coupling compared to
semiconductor platforms. We derive the effective Hamiltonian for the spin
dynamics of the junction's zero modes and calculate their quantum phases. We
find a sweet spot in parameter space where the spin is fully in-plane and
radially polarized for a given junction polarity. This represents a shortcut to
singular spin configurations that would otherwise require spin-orbit coupling
strengths beyond experimental reach.

Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid halide perovskite are quasi-two-dimensional
materials with a layered structure and structural dynamics that are determined
by the interplay between the organic and inorganic layers. While their optical
properties are governed by confinement effects, the atomistic origin of thermal
and electronic properties of these materials is yet to be fully established.
Here we combine computational and experimental techniques to study A$_2$PbI$_4$
(A=butylammonium (BA), phenethylammonium (PEA)) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites
and compare them with the quintessential perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$. We use
first-principles density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulations
based on machine-learned interatomic potentials, thermal measurements,
temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy, to probe the thermal and electronic properties of these materials
at elevated temperatures. Our molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that
dynamic fluctuations in the organic sublattice determine the bulk-average
distortions of these materials at room-temperature, explaining significant
differences in their electronic density of states close to the Fermi level.
Furthermore, by analysing the organic layer dynamics in BA$_2$PbI$_4$ we
provide a mechanistic explanation for the phase transition of this material at
274 K and observations from Raman measurements. Our results highlight the role
of the organic interlayer for the electronic and thermal transport properties
of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites, paving the way for the design of new hybrid
materials for tailored applications.

<h3>Tailoring the plasticity of topologically close-packed phases via the  crystals' fundamental building blocks</h3>

<br>
Brittle topologically close-packed precipitates form in many advanced alloys.
Due to their complex structures little is known about their plasticity. Here,
we present a strategy to understand and tailor the deformability of these
complex phases by considering the Nb-Co {\mu}-phase as an archetypal material.
The plasticity of the Nb-Co {\mu}-phase is controlled by the Laves phase
building block that forms parts of its unit cell. We find that between the bulk
C15-NbCo$_2$ Laves and Nb-Co {\mu}-phase, the interplanar spacing and local
elastic modulus of the Laves phase building block change, leading to a strong
reduction in hardness and elastic modulus, as well as a transition from
synchroshear to crystallographic slip. Furthermore, as the composition changes
from Nb$_6$Co$_7$ to Nb$_7$Co$_6$, the Co atoms in the triple layer are
substituted such that the triple layer of the Laves phase building block
becomes a slab of pure Nb, resulting in inhomogeneous changes in elasticity and
a transition from crystallographic slip to a glide-and-shuffle mechanism. These
findings open opportunities to purposefully tailor the plasticity of these
topologically close-packed phases in bulk, but at the atomic scale of
interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the fundamental crystal building
blocks in their large unit cells.

<br>
<br>
Introducing an in-plane magnetic field into Josephson junctions is of
fundamental significance in exploring a variety of interesting physical
phenomena. However, extra care must be paid in realistic experiments involving
an in-plane magnetic field, because trivial orbital effect due to, e.g.,
rippled structures can inevitably be introduced, which could produce false
effect confusing the expected physical phenomena. In this work, we report a
diamond-shaped evolution of the critical supercurrent in an in-plane magnetic
field in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions. Upon application of an in-plane
magnetic field perpendicular to the current, the superconducting interference
pattern exhibits a characteristic evolution, which manifests as a diamond block
diagram featured with each node opened and stretched out in a V-shape,
mimicking the suppression-recovery patterns of critical supercurrent related to
the Zeeman-driven 0-pi transition. However, the effect of Zeeman splitting
plays a negligible role due to the relatively small magnetic field involved in
our experiment. Therefore, we explore the trivial orbital effect of rippled
structures and further take into account non-uniform current distributions
pertaining in our junctions. We find that the ripples in combination with
specific current distributions can give rise to a similar evolution pattern as
the experimental observations. Our results serve as a caution that the combined
effect of rippled structures and non-homogeneous current distributions should
be taken seriously for experiments subjected by in-plane magnetic fields.

When a charge current is injected into the surface state of a topological
insulator (TI), the resulting shift of the spin-momentum-locked Fermi surface
leads to the appearance of a net spin polarization. The helical spin structure
of the Dirac-cone surface state of a TI should lead to a fixed sign of this
spin polarization for a given current direction, but experimentally, both signs
that agree and disagree with the theory expectation for the surface state Dirac
cone have been observed in the past. Although the origin of the wrong sign has
not been conclusively elucidated, this observation points to the possibility
that one may switch the spin polarization at will to realize a spin transistor
operation. Here we report the observation of both signs of spin polarization in
the very same device and demonstrate the tunability between the two by
electrostatic gating, which gives a proof of principle of a topological
insulator spin transistor. This switching behaviour is explained using a
minimal model of competing contributions from the topological surface state and
trivial Rashba-split states.

<br>
<br>
We present an extension to simple s-d models, aiming at simulating ultrafast
magnetization dynamics and spin transport in metallic heterostructures. In
particular, we consider an alternative spin dissipation channel due to a finite
exchange splitting of the s band. From this theory, we show three different
mechanisms governing the dynamics of spin accumulation. On top of the already
widely discussed "-dM/dt" electron-magnon mechanism, we study the role of a
dynamic change of exchange splitting (of conduction electrons) as well as the
rotation of spins reflected at an interface with a ferromagnet. Finally, we use
the presented theory to explain the recent observation of subpicosecond
reversal of a ferromagnet in rare-earth free spin-valves. Our conclusion agrees
with the one of reference [1] favoring magnetization reversal due to the
rotation of the spin polarization of a reflected spin current.

The normal-state transport properties of superconducting infinite-layer
nickelates are investigated within an interacting three-orbital model. It
includes effective Ni-$d_{z^2}$, Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands as well as the
self-doping band degree of freedom. Thermopower, Hall coefficient and optical
conductivity are modelled within a quasiparticle approximation to the
electronic states. Qualitative agreement in comparison to experimentally
available Hall data is achieved, with notably a temperature-dependent sign
change of the Hall coefficient for larger hole doping $x$. The Seebeck
coefficient changes from negative to positive in a non-trivial way with $x$,
but generally shows only modest temperature dependence. The optical
conductivity shows a pronounced Drude response and a prominent peak structure
at higher frequencies due to interband transitions. While the quasiparticle
picture is surely approximative to low-valence nickelates, it provides
enlightening insights into the multiorbital nature of these challenging
systems.

<i>Alex Kleiner</i>
<br>
<br>
In weakly buckled carbon nanotubes, the kink is an open, ovalized
constriction where molecular-sized analytes and ions can pass. Moreover, in
semiconducting tubes, the kink has an electronic bound state within the
bandgap. This state is localized, hence highly susceptible to electrostatic
perturbation by a proximate, itinerant ion. The degree to which this
perturbation will modulate the electronic current, which is our signal, can be
maximized in a tunnel-junction set-up, near resonance. We thus propose such a
device, analyze its performance and, since the bound state depends on the
post-buckling bending, suggest a scalable fabrication method to achieve bending
and buckling of carbon nanotubes to an adjustable degree.

<br>
A formalism for quantum many-body systems is proposed through semiclassical
treatment in phase space, establishing a stochastic thermodynamics
incorporating quantum statistics. Specifically, we utilize a stochastic
Fokker-Planck equation as the dynamics at the mesoscopic level, where a noise
term accounts for the finite-N effects of the system and leads to a
quasi-equilibrium distribution in a canonical system. We define the stochastic
thermodynamic quantities based on a trajectory of phase-space distribution. The
conservation law of energy, H-theorem and fluctuation theorems are also
obtained. Our work set an alternative formalism of quantum stochastic
thermodynamics that is independent of the two-point measurement scheme. Also,
we expect that our formalism can be experimentally verified through practical
sampling of the phase-space distribution.

A supercurrent on the proximitized surface of a topological insulator can
cause a delocalization transition of a Majorana fermion bound to a vortex core
as a zero-mode. Here we study the dynamics of the deconfinement, as a
manifestation of the Magnus effect (the coupling of the superflow to the
velocity field in the vortex). The initial acceleration of the Majorana fermion
is $\pm 2v_{\rm F}^2 K/\hbar$, perpendicular to the Cooper pair momentum $K$,
for a $\pm 2\pi$ winding of the superconducting phase around the vortex. The
quasiparticle escapes with a constant velocity from the vortex core, which we
calculate in a semiclassical approximation and compare with computer
simulations.

Strong interactions between different degrees of freedom lead to exotic
phases of matter with complex order parameters and emergent collective
excitations. Conventional techniques, such as scattering and transport, probe
the amplitudes of these excitations, but they are typically insensitive to
phase. Therefore, novel methods with phase sensitivity are required to
understand ground states with phase modulations and interactions that couple to
the phase of collective modes. Here, by performing phase-resolved coherent
phonon spectroscopy (CPS), we reveal a hidden spin-lattice coupling in a vdW
antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$ that eluded other phase-insensitive conventional
probes, such as Raman and X-ray scattering. With comparative analysis and
analytical calculations, we directly show that the magnetic order in FePS$_{3}$
selectively couples to the trigonal distortions through partially filled
t$_{2g}$ orbitals. This magnetoelastic coupling is linear in magnetic order and
lattice parameters, rendering these distortions inaccessible to inelastic
scattering techniques. Our results not only capture the elusive spin-lattice
coupling in FePS$_3$, but also establish phase-resolved CPS as a tool to
investigate hidden interactions.

Magnetic skyrmions are fascinating topological particle-like textures
promoted by a trade-off among interfacial properties (perpendicular anisotropy
and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)) and dipolar interactions.
Depending on the dominant interaction, complex spin textures, including pure
N\'eel and hybrid skyrmions have been observed in multilayer heterostructures.
A quantification of these different spin textures typically requires a
depth-reoslved magnetic imaging or scattering techniques. In the present work,
we will show qualitatively different collapsing dynamics for pure N\'eel and
hybrid skyrmions induced by a perpendicular magnetic field in two
representative systems, [Pt/Co/Ir]15 and [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]15 multilayers.
Skyrmions in the former stack undergo two morphological transitions, upon
reversing the perpendicular field direction. Skyrmions in [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]15
multilayers exhibit a continuous transition, which is mainly linked to a
reversible change of the skyrmion size. A full micromagnetic phase diagram is
presented to identify these two collapsing mechanisms as a function of material
parameters. Since the two distinct collapsing dynamics rely on the detailed
layer-dependent spin structures of skyrmions, they could be used as potential
fingerprints for identifying the skyrmion type in magnetic multilayers. Our
work suggests the employment of pure and hybrid skyrmions for specific
applications, due to the strong correlation between the skyrmion dynamics and
3-dimentional spin profiles.

Hematite ${\alpha}-Fe_{2}O_{3}(0001)$ is the most-investigated iron oxide
model system in photo and electrocatalytic research. The rich chemistry of Fe
and O allows for many bulk and surface transformations, but their control is
challenging. This has led to controversies regarding the structure of the
topmost layers. This comprehensive study combines surface methods (nc-AFM, STM,
LEED, and XPS) complemented by structural and chemical analysis of the
near-surface bulk (HRTEM and EELS). The results show that a compact 2D layer
constitutes the topmost surface of ${\alpha}-Fe_{2}O_{3}(0001)$; it is locally
corrugated due to the mismatch with the bulk. Assessing the influence of
naturally-occurring impurities shows that these can force the formation of
surface phases that are not stable on pure samples. Impurities can also cause
the formation of ill-defined inclusions in the subsurface and modify the
oxidation phase diagram of hematite. The results provide a significant step
forward in determining the hematite surface structure that is crucial for
accurately modeling catalytic reactions. Combining surface and cross-sectional
imaging provided the full view that is essential for understanding the
evolution of the near-surface region of oxide surfaces under oxidative
conditions.

<h3>Semiclassical transport in two-dimensional Dirac materials with  spatially variable tilt</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use Boltzmann and Drude model to study the semi-classical dynamics of
electrons in a sheet of tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in
space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial
spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. We find
a geometric Hall effect (GHE) that results from an emergent pseudo-magnetic
field $B_5^{\rm geo}=\nabla\times\boldsymbol\zeta$. This is akin to
pseudo-gauge fields arising in strained graphene. Within the Drude model we
find peculiar non-linear currents that arise when the applied electric field
has a component along the tilt vector $\boldsymbol\zeta_0$ even in the constant
tilt case. This can be regarded as the direct consequence of the covariant form
of electromagnetic forces in the emergent synthetic spacetime of such solids.
We further find persistent currents that are present in the absence of
externally applied electric field. These currents reveal the built-in electric
fields that form the fabric of the emergent spacetime.

<h3>Conductivity of infinite-layer NdNiO$_{2}$ as a probe of spectator bands</h3>

<br>
<i>Harrison LaBollita, Alexander Hampel, Jonathan Karp, Antia S. Botana, Andrew J. Millis</i>
<br>
<br>
Using a density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory
methodology, we compute the many-body electronic structure and optical
conductivity of NdNiO$_{2}$ under the influence of large scattering rates on
the Nd($5d$) bands and including dynamical interactions on the Nd($5d$)
orbitals with shifts of the Nd-Ni $d$-level energy difference. We find a robust
conducting pathway in the out-of-plane direction arising from strong
hybridization between the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and Nd($5d$) orbitals. This pathway can
be ``short-circuited'' if this hybridization is suppressed through large
electronic scattering rates but is not reduced to zero even by very large
beyond-DFT shifts of the Nd-Ni $d$-level energy splitting. The computed
in-plane conductivity for NdNiO$_{2}$ predicts the material to be a ``good
metal'' in contrast to experiments indicating the material is a ``bad metal''
or ``weak insulator''. Our results motivate future experiments measuring the
$c$-axis resistivity as a proxy for the spectator bands and suggests the
essential difference between the infinite-layer nickelates and the cuprates is
dimensionality of their electronic structures.

<h3>Optimal foraging strategies can be learned and outperform Lévy walks</h3>

<br>
<br>
L\'evy walks and other theoretical models of optimal foraging have been
successfully used to describe real-world scenarios, attracting attention in
several fields such as economy, physics, ecology, and evolutionary biology.
However, it remains unclear in most cases which strategies maximize foraging
efficiency and whether such strategies can be learned by living organisms. To
address these questions, we model foragers as reinforcement learning agents. We
first prove theoretically that maximizing rewards in our reinforcement learning
model is equivalent to optimizing foraging efficiency. We then show with
numerical experiments that our agents learn foraging strategies which
outperform the efficiency of known strategies such as L\'evy walks.

<h3>Comment on paper: Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled  by quantum geometry, Nature 614, 440 (2023)</h3>

We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state
at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified
by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong
coupling superconductivity in flat band ("Evidence for Dirac flat band
superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry" Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were
predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at
$T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. We believe that missing and/or
neglecting appropriate results may lead to errors.

<h3>Optimized proximity thermometer for ultrasensitive detection: Role of an  ohmic electromagnetic environment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06059" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06059</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
We propose a mesoscopic thermometer for ultrasensitive detection based on the
proximity effect in superconductor (S)-normal-metal (N) heterostructures. The
device is based on the zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) due to the inelastic Cooper pair
tunneling in an SNIS junction (I stands for an insulator) coupled to an ohmic
electromagnetic (EM) environment. The theoretical model is done in the
framework of the quasiclassical Usadel Green's formalism and the dynamical
Coulomb blockade. The usage of an ohmic EM environment makes the thermometer
highly sensitive and not saturating down to very low temperatures, $T \lesssim
5~$mK. Moreover, defined in this way, the thermometer is stable against small
but non-vanishing voltage amplitudes typically used for measuring the zero-bias
differential conductance in experiments. Finally, we proposed a simplified
view, based on an analytic treatment, which is in very good agreement with
numerical results and can serve as a tool for the development, calibration, and
optimization of such devices in future experiments in quantum calorimetry.

<h3>Instabilities of interacting matter waves in optical lattices with  Floquet driving</h3>

We experimentally investigate the stability of a quantum gas with repulsive
interactions in an optical 1D lattice subjected to periodic driving.
Excitations of the gas in the lowest lattice band are analyzed across the
complete stability diagram, from slow to fast driving frequencies and from weak
to strong driving strengths. To interpret our results, we expand the
established analysis based on parametric instabilities to include modulational
instabilities. Extending the concept of modulational instabilities from static
to periodically driven systems provides a convenient mapping of the stability
in a static system to the cases of slow and fast driving. At intermediate
driving frequencies, we observe an interesting competition between modulational
and parametric instabilities. We experimentally confirm the existence of both
types of instabilities in driven systems and probe their properties. Our
results allow us to predict stable and unstable parameter regions for the
minimization of heating in future applications of Floquet driving.

<h3>Anomalously Abrupt Switching of Ferroelectric Wurtzites</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ferroelectric polarization switching is one common example of a process that
occurs via nucleation and growth, and understanding switching kinetics is
crucial for applications such as ferroelectric memory. Here we describe and
interpret anomalous switching dynamics in the wurtzite nitride thin film
ferroelectrics Al0.7Sc0.3N and Al0.94B0.06N using a general model that can be
directly applied to other abrupt transitions that proceed via nucleation and
growth. When substantial growth and impingement occur while nucleation rate is
increasing, such as in these wurtzite ferroelectrics under high electric
fields, abrupt polarization reversal leads to very large Avrami coefficients
(e.g., n = 11), inspiring an extension of the KAI (Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi)
model. We apply this extended model to two related but distinct scenarios that
crossover between (typical) behavior described by sequential nucleation and
growth and a more abrupt transition arising from significant growth prior to
peak nucleation rate. This work therefore provides more complete description of
general nucleation and growth kinetics applicable to any system while
specifically addressing both the anomalously abrupt polarization reversal
behavior in new wurtzite ferroelectrics.

<h3>Supersolid phases of bosonic particles in a bubble trap</h3>

Confinement can have a considerable effect on the behavior of particle
systems, and is therefore an effective way to discover new phenomena. A notable
example is a system of identical bosons at low temperature under an external
potential mimicking an isotropic bubble trap, which constrains the particles to
a portion of space close to a spherical surface. Using Path integral Monte
Carlo simulations, we examine the spatial structure and superfluid fraction in
two emblematic cases. First, we look at soft-core bosons, finding the existence
of supersolid cluster arrangements with polyhedral symmetry; we show how
different numbers of clusters are stabilized depending on the trap radius and
the particle mass, and we characterize the temperature behavior of the cluster
phases. A detailed comparison with the behavior of classical soft-core
particles is provided too. Then, we examine the case of a dipolar condensate,
of more immediate experimental interest, on the sphere, demonstrating how a
quasi-one-dimensional supersolid of clusters is formed on a great circle for
realistic values of density and interaction parameters. We argue that the
predicted phases can be revealed in magnetic traps with spherical-shell
geometry. Our results pave the way for future simulation studies of correlated
quantum systems in curved geometries.

<h3>Aftermath Epidemics: Percolation on the Sites Visited by Generalized  Random Walks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06117" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06117</a>

We study percolation on the sites of a finite lattice visited by a
generalized random walk of finite length with periodic boundary conditions.
More precisely, consider Levy flights and walks with finite jumps of length
$>1$ (like knight's move random walks (RW) in 2 dimensions and generalized
knight's move RW in 3d). In these walks, the visited sites do not form (as in
ordinary RW) a single connected cluster, and thus percolation on them is
non-trivial. The model essentially mimics the spreading of an epidemic in a
population weakened by the passage of some devastating agent -- like diseases
in the wake of a passing army or of a hurricane. Using the density of visited
sites (or the number of steps in the walk) as a control parameter, we find a
true continuous percolation transition in all cases except for the 2-d knight's
move RW and Levy flights with Levy parameter $\sigma \geq 2$. For 3-d
generalized knight's move RW, the model is in the universality class of Pacman
percolation, and all critical exponents seem to be simple rationals, in
particular $\beta=1$. For 2-d Levy flights with $0 <\sigma < 2$, scale
invariance is broken even at the critical point, which leads at least to very
large corrections in finite size scaling, and even very large simulations were
unable to determine unambiguously the critical exponents.

<h3>A short note on the eigenvalues of regular Hall-plates</h3>

This note is about uniform, plane, singly connected, regular Hall-plates with
an arbitrary number of contacts exposed to a uniform magnetic field of
arbitrary strength. In practice, the regular symmetry is the most common one.
If the Hall-plates are mapped conformally to the unit disk, regular symmetry
means that all contacts are equally large and all contact spacings are equally
large, yet the contact spacing may be different from the size of the contacts.
The indefinite conductance matrices of such Hall-plates are circulant matrices,
whose complex eigenvalues are computed in closed form.

<h3>Dynamics of bistable Néel domain walls under spin-orbit torque</h3>

N\'eel magnetic domain walls that are stabilized by achiral energy terms
instead of the usual Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction will be bistable, with
the two possible chiral forms being degenerate. Here we focus on the
theoretical study of the spin-orbit torque driven dynamics of such bistable
N\'eel domain walls. We find that, for a given domain wall, two propagation
directions along a nanowire are possible, depending on its initial state. These
dynamics also exhibit complex dependence on the spin-orbit torque magnitude,
leading to important transient regimes. Finally, a few ways are proposed for
controlled or random reversal of the domain wall propagation direction. A
robust analytical model which handles all the observed behaviors of such domain
walls is developed and validated by comparing with numerical simulations. The
obtained new dynamics open the way for new uses of domain walls in information
storage and processing devices.
