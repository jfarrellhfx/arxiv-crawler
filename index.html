<h3>Analysis of Geometric Phases in Particle Diffusion Systems: Insights  from Non-Hermitian Heat Transfer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02079" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02079</a>
<br>
<i>Jinrong Liu, Liujun Xu, Gaole Dai, Gang Wang</i>
<p>Geometric phases in particle diffusion systems, an intriguing aspect
enlightened from thermal systems, offer a different understanding beyond
traditional Brownian motion and Fick's laws. This concept introduces a phase
factor with significant implications for particle behavior, central to which is
the non-Hermitian nature of the Hamiltonian in the diffusion system. A unique
structure composed of two rings moving in opposite directions and a stationary
intermediate layer plays multifunctional roles in controlling particle
diffusion. For the real-world application, a bilayer particle-diffusion cloak
is demonstrated, showcasing the extensive control and adaptability achievable
through mastering geometric phases. This system has potential applications in
industries like healthcare and environmental management, thus expanding the
understanding of the geometric phase and offering insights for the design of
particle-diffusion metamaterials.

<i>Di Luo, David D. Dai, Liang Fu</i>
<p>We introduce a pairing-based graph neural network, $\textit{GemiNet}$, for
simulating quantum many-body systems. Our architecture augments a BCS
mean-field wavefunction with a generalized pair amplitude parameterized by a
graph neural network. Variational Monte Carlo with GemiNet simultaneously
provides an accurate, flexible, and scalable method for simulating
many-electron systems. We apply GemiNet to two-dimensional semiconductor
electron-hole bilayers and obtain highly accurate results on a variety of
interaction-induced phases, including the exciton Bose-Einstein condensate,
electron-hole superconductor, and bilayer Wigner crystal. Our study
demonstrates the potential of physically-motivated neural network wavefunctions
for quantum materials simulations.

<p>Hopf insulator is a representative class of three-dimensional topological
insulators beyond the standard topological classification methods based on
K-theory. In this letter, we discover the metallic counterpart of the Hopf
insulator in the non-Hermitian systems. While the Hopf invariant is not a
stable topological index due to the additional non-Hermitian degree of freedom,
we show that the PT-symmetry stabilizes the Hopf invariant even in the presence
of the non-Hermiticity. In sharp contrast to the Hopf insulator phase in the
Hermitian counterpart, we discover an interesting result that the non-Hermitian
Hopf bundle exhibits the topologically protected non-Hermitian degeneracy,
characterized by the two-dimensional surface of exceptional points. Despite the
non-Hermiticity, the Hopf metal has the quantized Zak phase, which results in
bulk-boundary correspondence by showing drumhead-like surface states at the
boundary. Finally, we show that, by breaking PT-symmetry, the nodal surface
deforms into the knotted exceptional lines. Our discovery of the Hopf metal
phase firstly confirms the existence of the non-Hermitian topological phase
outside the framework of the standard topological classifications.

<h3>Generalized cold-atom simulators for vacuum decay</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02156" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02156</a>
<br>
<i>Alexander C. Jenkins, Ian G. Moss, Thomas P. Billam, Zoran Hadzibabic, Hiranya V. Peiris, Andrew Pontzen</i>
<p>Cold-atom analogue experiments are a promising new tool for studying
relativistic vacuum decay, allowing us to empirically probe early-Universe
theories in the laboratory. However, existing analogue proposals place
stringent requirements on the atomic scattering lengths that are challenging to
realize experimentally. Here we generalize these proposals and show that any
stable mixture between two states of a bosonic isotope can be used as a
relativistic analogue. This greatly expands the range of suitable experimental
setups, and will thus expedite efforts to study vacuum decay with cold atoms.

<h3>Boosting photocatalytic water splitting of polymeric C$_{60}$ by reduced  dimensionality from 2D monolayer to 1D chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02159" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02159</a>
<br>
<i>Cory Jones, Bo Peng</i>
<p>Recent synthesis of 2D fullerene networks [$Nature$ 606, 507 (2022) &
$Nature$ 613, 71 (2023)] provides new opportunities for photovoltaics and
photocatalysis because of their versatile crystal structures for further
tailoring of electronic, optical and chemical function. To shed light on the
structural aspects of photocatalytic water splitting performance of fullerene
nanomaterials, we compare the photocatalytic properties of individual polymeric
fullerene chains and monolayer fullerene networks from first principles
calculations. It is found that the photocatalytic efficiency can be further
optimised by reducing dimensionality from 2D to 1D. The conduction band edge of
the polymeric C$_{60}$ chain provides a much higher external potential for the
hydrogen reduction reaction than its monolayer counterparts over a wider range
of pH values, and the surface active sites in the 1D chain are two times more
than those in the 2D networks from a thermodynamic perspective. These
observations render the 1D fullerene polymer a more promising candidate as a
photocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction than monolayer fullerene
networks.

<h3>Exchange energy of the ferromagnetic electronic ground-state in a  monolayer semiconductor</h3>

<br>
<i>Nadine Leisgang, Dmitry Miserev, Hinrich Mattiat, Lukas Schneider, Lukas Sponfeldner, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Martino Poggio, Richard J. Warburton</i>
<p>Mobile electrons in the semiconductor monolayer-MoS$_2$ form a ferromagnetic
state at low temperature. The Fermi sea consists of two circles, one at the
$K$-point, the other at the $\tilde{K}$-point, both with the same spin. Here,
we present an optical experiment on gated MoS$_2$ at low electron-density in
which excitons are injected with known spin and valley quantum numbers. The
resulting trions are identified using a model which accounts for the injection
process, the formation of antisymmetrized trion states, electron-hole
scattering from one valley to the other, and recombination. The results are
consistent with a complete spin polarization. From the splittings between
different trion states, we measure the exchange energy, $\Sigma$, the energy
required to flip a single spin within the ferromagnetic state, as well as the
intervalley Coulomb exchange energy, $J$. We determine $\Sigma=11.2\,$meV and
$J=5\,$meV at $n=1.5 \times 10^{12}\,$cm$^{-2}$, and find that $J$ depends
strongly on the electron density, $n$.

<h3>Unveiling Quasiparticle Berry Curvature Effects in the Spectroscopic  Properties of a Chiral p-wave Superconductor</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02165" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02165</a>
<br>
<i>Yunxiang Liao, Yi-Ting Hsu</i>
<p>The focus of experimental efforts on topological superconductivity (TSC) has
predominantly centered around the detection of Majorana boundary modes. On the
contrary, the experimental features in the bulk properties of TSC remain
relatively unexplored, especially in 2D. Here, we theoretically examine how
spectroscopic properties away from the boundaries can be influenced by the
Berry curvatures (BCs) in two-dimensional chiral TSC, enabled by spin-orbit
couplings (SOC). Specifically, we analyze the semiclassical wavepacket dynamics
for quasiparticles in p+ip TSC achieved through Rashba SOC together with
proximity to a ferromagnet and conventional superconductor under an external
magnetic field B. Beyond the more well-known momentum-space and real-space BC
effects, we unveil a new phase-space BC term that emerges exclusively when the
SOC and superconductivity coexist, resulting from a Rashba-induced
quasiparticle charge dipole moment that couples to B. Importantly, we
demonstrate that this BC term grows linearly in B, and can have a discernible
impact on the energy- or momentum- resolved tunneling spectroscopy by
non-uniformly enhancing or suppressing peak intensities. This qualitative
effect originates from the BC-modified phase-space density of states, which can
be experimentally probed through the non-uniform changes in peak intensities
compared to the spectrum at B=0.

<h3>Controlling Nonequilibrium Bose Condensation with Engineered  Environments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02170</a>
<br>
<i>Francesco Petiziol, André Eckardt</i>
<p>Out of thermal equilibrium, bosonic quantum systems can Bose-condense away
from the ground state, featuring a macroscopic occupation of an excited state,
or even of multiple states in the so-called Bose-selection scenario. While
theory has been developed describing such effects as they result from the
nonequilibrium kinetics of quantum jumps, a theoretical understanding, and the
development of practical strategies, to control and drive the system into
desired Bose condensation patterns have been lacking. We show how fine-tuned
single or multiple condensate modes, including their relative occupation, can
be engineered by coupling the system to artificial quantum baths. Moreover, we
propose a Bose `condenser', experimentally implementable in a superconducting
circuit, where bath engineering is realized via auxiliary driven-damped
two-level systems, that induces targeted Bose condensation into eigenstates of
a chain of resonators. We further discuss the engineering of transition points
between different Bose condensation configurations, which may find application
for amplification, heat-flow control, and the design of highly-structured
quantum baths.

<h3>Localization and integrability breaking in weakly interacting Floquet  circuits</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02197" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02197</a>
<br>
<i>Dominik Hahn, Luis Colmenarez</i>
<p>We present a family of Floquet circuits that can interpolate between
non-interacting qubits, free propagation, generic interacting, and dual-unitary
dynamics. We identify the operator entanglement entropy of the two-qubit gate
as a good quantitative measure of the interaction strength. We test the
persistence of localization in the vicinity of the non-interacting point by
probing spectral statistics, decay of autocorrelators, and measuring
entanglement growth. The finite-size analysis suggests that the many-body
localized regime does not persist in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, our
results are compatible with an integrability-breaking phenomenon.

<h3>Inter-layer bias effect on time-reversal symmetry breaking in twisted  bilayer cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02207</a>
<br>
<i>Mathieu Bélanger, David Sénéchal</i>
<p>We study a one-band Hubbard model of twisted bilayer cuprates with a twist
angle of $53.13^\circ$. By introducing an inter-layer bias, we simulate
heterobilayers of different dopings. Using the variational cluster
approximation (VCA) we probe the effect of this bias on the
time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking phase. Doping differences between layers
affect the region where TRS-breaking occurs; we construct a phase diagram
mapping out the TRS-breaking phase in the $n_1$-$n_2$ plane, $n_\ell$ being the
electron density on layer $\ell$. We also map the spontaneous supercurrent on
the same plane.

<h3>Anisotropic positive linear and sub-linear magnetoresistivity in the  cubic type-II Dirac metal Pd$_3$In$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02212" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02212</a>
<br>
<i>Aikaterini Flessa Savvidou, Andrzej Ptok, G. Sharma, Brian Casas, Judith K. Clark, Victoria M. Li, Michael Shatruk, Sumanta Tewari, Luis Balicas</i>
<p>We report a transport study on Pd$_3$In$_7$ which displays multiple Dirac
type-II nodes in its electronic dispersion. Pd$_3$In$_7$ is characterized by
low residual resistivities and high mobilities, which are consistent with
Dirac-like quasiparticles. For an applied magnetic field $(\mu_{\text{0}} H)$
having a non-zero component along the electrical current, we find a large,
positive, and linear in $\mu_{\text{0}} H$ longitudinal magnetoresistivity
(LMR). The sign of the LMR and its linear dependence deviate from the behavior
reported for the chiral-anomaly-driven LMR in Weyl semimetals. Interestingly,
such anomalous LMR is consistent with predictions for the role of the anomaly
in type-II Weyl semimetals. In contrast, the transverse or conventional
magnetoresistivity (CMR for electric fields $\textbf{E} \bot \mu_{\text{0}}
\textbf{H}$) is large and positive, increasing by $10^3-10^4$ \% as a function
of $\mu_{\text{0}}H$ while following an anomalous, angle-dependent power law
$\rho_{\text{xx}}\propto (\mu_{\text{0}}H)^n$ with $n(\theta) \leq 1$. The
order of magnitude of the CMR, and its anomalous power-law, is explained in
terms of uncompensated electron and hole-like Fermi surfaces characterized by
anisotropic carrier scattering likely due to the lack of Lorentz invariance.

<h3>Influence of a static electric field on a one-dimensional Bose-Fermi  mixture confined in a double potential welll</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02218</a>
<br>
<i>Avella Richard, Grajales Diana, Rubio Juan Pablo</i>
<p>In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation into the time evolution
of the probability density within a 1D double-well potential hosting a
Bose-Fermi mixture. This system comprised spinless bosons and spin one-half
fermions with weak repulsive contact interactions. Notably, even at very low
effective coupling constants, periodic probabilities were observed, indicating
correlated tunneling of both bosons and fermions, leading to complete
miscibility, which disappears when an external electric field is turned on. The
electric field accentuated fermion-fermion interactions due to the Pauli
exclusion principle, altering both boson density and interactions and leading
to spatial redistribution of particles. These findings underscore the complex
interplay between interactions, external fields, and spatial distributions
within confined quantum systems.
Our exploration of higher interaction strengths revealed conditions under
which probability density functions are decoupled. Furthermore, we observed
that increased fermion interaction, driven by the electric field, led to higher
tunneling frequencies for both species because of the repulsive nature of the
boson-fermion interaction. Conversely, increased boson-boson interaction
resulted in complete tunneling of both species, especially when boson density
was high, leading to effective fermion repulsion. Expanding our analysis to
scenarios involving four bosons demonstrated that higher interaction values
corresponded to increased oscillation frequencies in tunneling probabilities.
Finally, by manipulating interaction parameters and activating the electric
field, we achieved complete tunneling of both species, further increasing
oscillation frequencies and resulting in intervals characterized by overlapping
probability functions.

<h3>Fidelity and variability in the interlayer electronic structure of the  kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02289" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02289</a>
<br>
<i>Aurland K. Watkins, Dirk Johrendt, Vojtech Vlcek, Stephen D. Wilson, Ram Seshadri</i>
<p>The AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome materials host an interplay of emergent
phenomena including superconductivity, charge density wave states, and
non-trivial electronic structure topology. The band structures of these
materials exhibit a rich variety of features like Dirac crossings, saddle
points associated with van Hove singularities, and flat bands prompting
significant investigations into the in-plane electronic behavior. However,
recent findings including the charge density wave ordering and effects due to
pressure or chemical doping point to the importance of understanding
interactions between kagome layers. Probing this c-axis electronic structure
via experimental methods remains challenging due to limitations of the crystals
and, therefore, rigorous computational approaches are necessary to study the
interlayer interactions. Here we use first-principles approaches to study the
electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 with emphasis on the kz dispersion. We find
that the inclusion of nonlocal and dynamical many-body correlation has a
substantial impact on the interlayer band structure. We present new band
behavior that additionally supports the integration of symmetry in accurately
plotting electronic structures and influences further analysis like the
calculation of topological invariants.

<h3>Green light GaN p-n junction luminescent particles enhance the  superconducting properties of B(P)SCCO Smart Meta-Superconductors (SMSCs)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02336" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02336</a>
<br>
<i>Qingyu Hai, Honggang Chen, Chao Sun, Duo Chen, Yao Qi, Miao Shi, Xiaopeng Zhao</i>
<p>Superconducting materials exhibit unique physical properties and hold great
scientific value and vast industrial application prospects. However, due to
limitations such as critical temperature (TC) and critical current density
(JC), the large-scale application of superconducting materials remains
challenging. Chemical doping has been a commonly used method to enhance the
superconductivity of B(P)SCCO. However, satisfactory enhancement results have
been difficult to achieve. In this study, we introduced green light GaN p-n
junction particles as inhomogeneous phases into B(P)SCCO polycrystalline
particles to form a smart meta-superconductors (SMSCs) structure. Based on the
electroluminescence properties of the p-n junction, the Cooper pairs were
stimulated and strengthened to enhance the superconductivity of B(P)SCCO.
Experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of inhomogeneous phases
can indeed enhance the critical temperature TC, critical current density JC,
and complete diamagnetism (Meissner effect) of B(P)SCCO superconductors.
Moreover, When the particle size of raw material of B(P)SCCO is reduced from
30{\mu}m to 5{\mu}m, the grain size of the sintered samples also decreases, and
the optimal doping concentration of the inhomogeneous phases increases from
0.15 wt.% to 0.2 wt.%, further improving the enhancement of superconductivity.

<h3>Multiphonon interactions and collective excitations in charge density  wave of transition metal dichalcogenides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02371" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02371</a>
<br>
<i>Divya Rawat, Juhi Pandey, Ajay Soni</i>
<p>Charge density wave (CDW) is a periodic modulation of electronic charge
leading to a reconstruction of the lattice, an emergence of zone folded mode
along with collective excitations.1 Transition metal chalcogenides have shown a
great potential to study the underlying physics of multi body interactions like
electron-phonon (e-ph) as well as plasmons-phonon coupling,2,3 excitonic
complexes4 and CDW instabilities.5,6 We are elaborating on the collective
excitation and multiphonon interactions like amplitude, zone-folded and two
phonon (2_ph) mode associated with CDW in 2H-TaS2 and 2H-NbSe2. The 2_ph is a
unique excitation appears due to anharmonicity mediated longitudinal acoustic
modes associated with the Kohn anomaly and provides a substantial evidences of
e-ph coupling.7 The experimental observations of anomalous response of 2_ph
mode across CDW is clarified with phonon self-energy formalism. Transport
measurements shows that both materials exhibit incommensurate CDW (TI-CDW) at ~
76 K (2H-TaS2) and ~ 30 K (2H-NbSe2). As revealed by the estimated e-ph
coupling (l ~ 0.007 for 2H-NbSe2 and ~ 0.013 for 2H-TaS2) and anharmonicity
constant (d ~ 6.92 for 2H-NbSe2 and ~ 2.723 for 2H-TaS2), we emphasize on
higher e-ph coupling in 2H-TaS2 while larger anharmonicity 2H-NbSe2.

<h3>Effect of Andreev Processes on the Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift in the  Graphene-Superconductor-Graphene (GSG) junctions</h3>

<br>
<i>Shahrukh Salim, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh</i>
<p>In this article, we study the transport properties of
Graphene-Superconductor-Graphene (GSG) heterojunction where the superconducting
region is created in the middle of a graphene sheet, as contrasted to widely
studied transport properties through a Superconductor-Graphene-Superconductor
(SGS) type of Josephson junction. We particularly analyse in detail the
Goos-H\"anchen shift of the electron and the hole at the GS interface in such a
junction, due to normal as well as Andreev reflection, using a transfer
matrix-based approach. Additionally, we evaluate the normalised differential
conductance as a function of bias voltage that characterises the transport
through such junction and point out how they are influenced by Andreev and
normal reflection. In the subsequent parts of the article we demonstrate how
the GH shift for both electron and hole changes with the width of the
superconducting region. The behavior of the differential conductance in such
junctions as a function of the bias voltage in the region, dominated by Andreev
and normal reflection, is also presented and analysed.

<h3>Electronic quantum wires in extended quasiparticle picture</h3>

<br>
<i>Klaus Morawetz, Vinod Ashokan, Kare Narain Pathak, Neil Drummond, Gianaurelio Cuniberti</i>
<p>A one-dimensional quantum wire of Fermions is considered and ground state
properties are calculated in the high density regime within the extended
quasiparticle picture and Born approximation. Expanding the two-particle Green
functions determines the selfenergy and the polarization as well as the
response function on the same footing. While the on-shell selfenergies are
strictly zero due to Pauli-blocking of elastic scattering, the off-shell
behaviour shows a rich structure of a gap in the damping of excitation which is
closed when the momentum approaches the Fermi one. The consistent spectral
function is presented completing the first two energy-weighted sum rules. The
excitation spectrum shows a splitting due to holons and antiholons as non-Fermi
liquid behaviour. A renormalization procedure is proposed by subtracting an
energy constant to render the Fock exchange energy finite. The effective mass
derived from meanfield shows a dip as onset of Peierls instability. The
correlation energy is calculated with the help of the extended quasiparticle
picture which accounts for off-shell effects. The corresponding response
function leads to the same correlation energy as the selfenergy in agreement
with perturbation theory. The reduced density matrix or momentum distribution
is calculated with the help of a Pad\'e regularization repairing deficiencies
of the perturbation theory. A seemingly finite step at the Fermi energy
indicating Fermi-liquid behaviour is repaired in this way.

<h3>Molecular dynamics simulation of the coalescence of surfactant-laden  droplets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02417" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02417</a>
<br>
<i>Soheil Arbabi, Piotr Deuar, Mateusz Denys, Rachid Bennacer, Zhizhao Che, Panagiotis E. Theodorakis</i>
<p>We investigate the coalescence of surfactant-laden water droplets by using
several different surfactant types and a wide range of concentrations by means
of a coarse-grained model obtained by the statistical associating fluid theory.
Our results demonstrate in detail a universal mass transport mechanism of
surfactant across many concentrations and several surfactant types during the
process. Coalescence initiation is seen to occur via a single pinch due to
aggregation of surface surfactant, and its remnants tend to become engulfed in
part inside the forming bridge. Across the board we confirm the existence of an
initial thermal regime with constant bridge width followed by a later inertial
regime with bridge width scaling roughly as the square root of time, but see no
evidence of an intermediate viscous regime. Coalescence becomes slower as
surfactant concentration grows, and we see evidence of the appearance of a
further slowdown of a different nature for several times the critical
concentration. We anticipate that our results provide further insights in the
mechanisms of coalescence of surfactant-laden droplets.

<h3>Effect of W alloying on the electronic structure, phase stability and  thermoelectric properties of epitaxial CrN films</h3>

<br>
<i>Niraj Kumar Singh, Victor Hjort, Davide Gambino, Arnaud le Febvrier, Ganpati Ramanath, Björn Alling, Per Eklund</i>
<p>The effects of W alloying on the electronic structure, phase stability, and
thermoelectric properties of Cr1-xWxN films with 0 \leq x \leq 0.48 are
reported. Ab initio calculations indicate that dilute W alloying (x = 0.03)
results in flat bands from W 5d states and pushes the Fermi level EF into the
conduction band, while retaining dispersive Cr 3d bands. These features are
collectively conducive for both high electrical conductivity \sigma and high
Seebeck coefficient \alpha. Epitaxial Cr1-xWxN films grown on c-plane sapphire
by dc-magnetron sputtering show that \sigma increases with W additions of x
\leq 0.2. Higher W levels results in the formation of metallic Cr2N and W
precipitation, yielding high \sigma but low \alpha. These findings suggest that
restricting the W level to below its solubility limit in CrN is key to
realizing high thermoelectric properties in Cr1-xWxN alloys.

<h3>Phonon-mediated unconventional $s$- and $f$-wave pairing  superconductivity in rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02494" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02494</a>
<br>
<i>Emil Viñas Boström, Ammon Fischer, Jonas B. Hauck, Jin Zhang, Dante M. Kennes, Angel Rubio</i>
<p>Understanding the origin of superconductivity in correlated two-dimensional
materials is a key step in leveraging material engineering techniques for
next-generation nanoscale devices. The recent demonstration of
superconductivity in Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene, as well
as in a large family of graphene-based moir\'e systems, indicate a common
superconducting mechanism across these platforms. Here we combine first
principles simulations with effective low-energy theories to investigate the
superconducting mechanism and pairing symmetry in rhombohedral stacked graphene
multilayers. We find that a phonon-mediated attraction can quantitatively
explain the main experimental findings, namely the displacement field and
doping dependence of the critical temperature and the presence of two
superconducting regions whose pairing symmetries depend on the parent normal
state. In particular, we find that intra-valley phonon scattering favors a
triplet $f$-wave pairing out of a spin and valley polarized normal state. We
also propose a new and so far unexplored superconducting region at higher hole
doping densities $n_h \approx 4 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, and demonstrate how
this large hole-doped regime can be reached in heterostructures consisting of
monolayer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and rhombohedral trilayer graphene.

<h3>Polaritonic ultracold reactions: cavity controlled molecular  photoassociation</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02497" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02497</a>
<br>
<i>Vasil Rokaj, Simeon I. Mistakidis, H. R. Sadeghpour</i>
<p>We introduce a prototypical model for cavity polaritonic control of ultracold
photochemistry by considering the resonant vibrational strong coupling of a
rubidium dimer to a terahertz cavity. We demonstrate that at avoided crossings
between a vibrational excitation and the vacuum photon absorption, the
resulting polaritonic states between the molecule and photons can efficiently
control the molecular vibrational Franck-Condon (FC) factors. Due to the
entanglement between light and matter, FC factor is transferred from one
polaritonic branch to other, leading to a polariton with a substantially
enhanced FC factor. Utilizing this polariton state for photoassociation results
in the enhanced formation of ultracold molecules. This work suggests a path to
controlling photoassociation with cavity vacuum fields, and lays the ground for
the emerging subfield of polaritonic ultracold chemistry.

<p>Recent experiments demonstrate that a charge qubit consisting of a single
electron bound to a solid neon surface exhibits an exceptionally long coherence
time, making it a promising platform for quantum computing. However, some
observations cast doubt on the direct correlation between the electron's
binding mechanism and quantum states with the applied electric trapping
potential. In this study, we introduce a theoretical framework to examine the
electron's interactions with neon surface topography, such as bumps and
valleys. By evaluating the surface charges induced by the electron, we
demonstrate its strong perpendicular binding to the neon surface. The
Schrodinger equation for the electron's lateral motion on the curved 2D surface
is then solved for extensive topographical variations. Our results reveal that
surface bumps can naturally bind an electron, forming unique ring-shaped
quantum states that align with experimental observations. We also show that the
electron's excitation energy can be smoothly tuned using an magnetic field to
facilitate qubit operation. This study offers a leap in our understanding of
e-neon qubit properties, laying the groundwork to guide its design and
optimization for advancing quantum computing architectures.

<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures have unique
properties that depend on the twisting angle and stacking order of two or more
monolayers. However, their practical applications are limited by the low
photoluminescence yield of interlayer excitons. This limits the use of layered
2D materials as a versatile platform for developing innovative optoelectronic
and spintronic devices. In this study, we report on the emission enhancement of
interlayer excitons in multilayered-stacked monolayers through the fabrication
of heterotrilayers consisting of WSe$_2$/WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ with differing twist
angles. Our results show that an additional WSe$_2$ monolayer introduces new
absorption pathways, leading to an improvement in the emission of interlayer
excitons by more than an order of magnitude. The emission boost is affected by
the twist angle, and we observe a tenfold increase in the heterotrilayer area
when there is a 44$^\circ$ angle between the WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ materials, as
opposed to their heterobilayer counterparts. Furthermore, using density
functional theory, we identify the emergence of new carrier transfer pathways
in the three-layer sample which extends the current understanding of 2D
semiconducting heterostructures. In addition, our research provides a viable
way to significantly enhance the emission of interlayer excitons. The emission
enhancement of interlayer excitons is significant not only for studying the
fundamental properties of interlayer excitons, but also for enabling
optoelectronic applications that utilize engineered 2D quantum materials with
high luminescence yield.

<p>We study quasi-freestanding bilayer graphene on silicon carbide intercalated
by calcium. The intercalation, and subsequent changes to the system, were
investigated by low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and density-functional theory (DFT). Calcium is found to
intercalate only at the graphene-SiC interface, completely displacing the
hydrogen terminating SiC. As a consequence, the system becomes highly n-doped.
Comparison to DFT calculations shows that the band dispersion, as determined by
ARPES, deviates from the band structure expected for Bernal-stacked bilayer
graphene. Instead, the electronic structure closely matches AA-stacked bilayer
graphene on Ca-terminated SiC, indicating a spontaneous transition from AB- to
AA-stacked bilayer graphene following calcium intercalation of the underlying
graphene-SiC interface.

<p>In recent years, the rising demand for close interaction with electronic
devices has led to a surge in the popularity of wearable gadgets. While
wearable gadgets have generally been rigid due to their utilisation of
silicon-based technologies, flexible semiconducting fibre-based transistors
will be needed for future wearables as active sensing components or within
microprocessors to manage and analyse data. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting
flakes are yet to be investigated in fibre transistors but could offer a route
toward high-mobility, biocompatible and flexible fibre-based devices. Here we
report the electrochemical exfoliation of semiconducting two-dimensional (2D)
flakes of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The high
aspect ratio (>100) of the flakes achieves aligned and conformal flake-to-flake
junctions on polyester fibres enabling transistors with mobilities ~ 1 cm^2
V^-1 s^-1 and a current on/off ratio, Ion/Ioff ~ 10^2 - 10^4. Furthermore, the
cytotoxic effects of the MoS2 and WSe2 flakes with human keratinocyte cells are
investigated and found to be biocompatible. As an additional step, we create a
unique transistor knot architecture by leveraging the fibre diameter to
establish the length of the transistor channel, facilitating a route to scale
down transistor channel dimensions (100 {\mu}m) and utilise it to make MoS2
fibre transistors with a human hair that achieves mobilities as high as {\mu} ~
15 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1.

<p>Resolving single atoms in large-scale volumes has been a goal for atomic
resolution microscopy for a long time. Electron microscopy has come close to
this goal using a combination of advanced electron optics and computational
imaging algorithms. However, atomic-resolution 3D imaging in volumes larger
than the depth of field limit of the electron optics has so far been out of
reach. Electron ptychography, a computational imaging method allowing to solve
the multiple-scattering problem from position- and momentum-resolved
measurements, provides the opportunity to surpass this limit. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate atomic resolution three-dimensional phase-contrast
imaging in a volume surpassing the depth of field limits using multi-slice
ptychographic electron tomography. We reconstruct tilt-series 4D-STEM
measurements of a Co3O4 nanocube, yielding 1.75 {\AA} resolution in a
reconstructed volume of (18.2nm)^3.

<p>The realization of spin-orbit-coupled ultracold gases has driven a wide range
of researches and is typically based on the rotating wave approximation (RWA).
By neglecting the counter-rotating terms, RWA characterizes a single
near-resonant spin-orbit (SO) coupling in a two-level system. Here, we propose
and experimentally realize a new scheme for achieving a pair of two-dimensional
(2D) SO couplings for ultracold fermions beyond RWA. This work not only
realizes the first anomalous Floquet topological Fermi gas beyond RWA, but also
significantly improves the lifetime of the 2D-SO-coupled Fermi gas. Based on
pump-probe quench measurements, we observe a deterministic phase relation
between two sets of SO couplings, which is characteristic for our beyond-RWA
scheme and enables the two SO couplings to be simultaneously tuned to the
optimum 2D configurations. We observe intriguing band topology by measuring
two-ring band-inversion surfaces, quantitatively consistent with a Floquet
topological Fermi gas in the regime of high Chern numbers. Our study can open
an avenue to explore exotic SO physics and anomalous topological states based
on long-lived SO-coupled ultracold fermions.

<h3>Dielectric behavior and impedance spectroscopy of Niobium substituted  Lanthanum based orthovanadates at high temperatures</h3>

<i>Ashok Kumar, Vikas N. Thakur, Ajay Kumar, Vinod Singh, Anita Dhaka, Rajendra S. Dhaka</i>
<p>We present the detailed study of the temperature dependent dielectric
properties, impedance spectroscopy and electrical conductivity of
LaV$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_4$ ($x=$ 0-1) samples prepared by the solid-state reaction
method. The dielectric constant ($\epsilon_r'$) increases (decreases) with
increase in the temperature (frequency); while, the magnitude of $\epsilon_r'$
remains almost invariant (order of 10$^4$ at 100~Hz and 600\degree C) with $x$.
The single phase $x=$ 0 (monoclinic-monazite, $P2_1/n$) and $x =$ 1 (monoclinic
fergusonite, $I2/a$) samples show the lower values of loss factor [tan$\delta=$
(4-8)] as compared to the $x=$ 0-0.8 samples [tan$\delta=$(12-18)] having mixed
tetragonal and monoclinic phases, which indicates the strong correlation
between the crystal structure and the dielectric properties. The real part of
impedance decreases with both temperature and frequency, and the observed weak
relaxation remains almost unaltered with $x$. The imaginary part of impedance
shows strong relaxation peaks shifting towards higher temperatures with
frequency, which is attributed to the effect of grains, grain boundaries, and
electrodes in the samples. The activation energy of the relaxation process is
estimated to be 0.8-1.0~eV for the $x=$ 0-0.6 samples, and $\approx$1.4~eV for
the $x=$ 0.8; whereas the $x=$ 1 sample shows two values ($\approx$0.5~eV and
$\approx$1.0~eV) in the higher and lower temperature range, respectively.
Further, the change in total conductivity with the angular frequency, which
found to be in the range of 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-5}$~S/m, is fitted using the
Jonsher power law. The analysis suggests the OLPT model for all the samples,
whereas the $x$ = 1 sample exhibit a transition near 480\degree C and at higher
temperatures it shows NSPT and QMT. This transition is corroborated by the
tangent loss curves and may be associated with the change in structure.

<h3>On Quantum Equipartition Theorem for General Systems</h3>

<i>Xin-Hai Tong, Yao Wang</i>
<p>Does the quantum equipartition theorem truly exist for any given system? If
so, what is the concrete form of such a theorem? The extension of the
equipartition theorem, a fundamental principle in classical statistical
physics, to the quantum regime raises these two crucial questions. In the
present Letter, we focus on how to answer them for arbitray systems. For this
propose, the inverse problem of the quantum equipartition theorem has been
successfully solved. This result, termed as the inverse equipartition theorem,
toghther with nonnegativity and normalizability of the distribution function
$\mathbb{P}(\omega)$ serves as a criterion for determining whether a given
system adheres to quantum equipartition theorem. If yes, the concrete form of
the theorem can be readily obtained. Fermionic version of them is also
discussed.Our results can be viewed as a general solution to the topics of
quantum equipartition theorem.

<i>Dario Lucente, Alberto Petri, Angelo Vulpiani</i>
<p>We consider the Prandtl-Tomlinson model in the case of a constant driving
force and in the presence of thermal fluctuations. We show that the system
dynamics is well reproduced by a simplified description obtained through a
Markov process, even in the case of potentials with several minima. After
estimating the chain parameters by numerical simulation, we compute the average
velocity and friction at varying driving force and temperature. Then we take
advantage of this approach for calculating the entropy produced by the system
and, in the case of a single minimum potential, to derive its explicit relation
with the external force and the mobility at low temperatures. We observe that
the coefficient relating the entropy production to the force is not a monotonic
function of the temperature.

<h3>Bulk-boundary-transport correspondence of the second-order topological  insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>Yuxiong Long^§, Miaomiao Wei^§, Fuming Xu, Jian Wang</i>
<p>The bulk-boundary correspondence of the second-order topological insulator
(SOTI) has been well established, but a universal transport signature for open
systems is still absent. For a variety of SOTIs induced by applying in-plane
magnetic fields in Z$_2$-invariant first-order TIs, rotating this magnetic
field features the spin pump mechanism while maintaining the SOTI phase. We
demonstrate that, this spin pump can generate quantized pure spin current when
tuning the magnetic field strength, which corresponds to the formation of
topological corner states characterizing SOTI in two-dimensional (2D) systems.
Quantized spin pump is discovered in various 2D and 3D SOTI models evolved from
Z$_2$-invariant TIs, which is robust against disorder and universally
independent of system parameters including Fermi energy, system size, magnetic
field strength, and pumping frequency. These findings suggest that this
universal quantized spin pump can characterize the bulk-boundary-transport
correspondence of SOTIs. Quantized spin pump can also be realized by combining
pseudo spin such as the orbital degree of freedom with the rotating magnetic
field, which could be achieved in higher-order photonic or acoustic topological
systems. Such a quantized spin pump is promising as an accurate and stable
single-spin source.

<h3>Quantum nonlinear ac transport theory at low frequency</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02620" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02620</a>
<br>
<i>Lei Zhang, Fuming Xu, Jian Chen, Yanxia Xing, Jian Wan</i>
<p>Based on the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF), we develop a quantum
nonlinear theory to study time-dependent ac transport properties in the low
frequency and nonlinear bias voltage regimes. By expanding NEGF in terms of
time to the linear order in Wigner representation, we can explicitly include
the time-dependent self-consistent Coulomb interaction induced by external ac
bias. Hence this theory automatically satisfies two basic requirements, i.e.,
current conservation and gauge invariance. Within this theory, the nonlinear ac
current can be evaluated at arbitrarily large bias voltages under the low
frequency limit. In addition, we obtain the expression of time-dependent
current under the wide band limit and derive the relation between the nonlinear
electrochemical capacitance and the bias voltage, which are very useful in
predicting the dynamical properties of nanoelectronic devices. This quantum
theory can be directly combined with density functional theory to investigate
time-dependent ac transport from first-principles calculation.

<h3>Towards out of equilibrium impurity solver for the Dynamical Mean Field  Theory</h3>

<i>A. Karpov, G.Sultanov, E. Polyakov, A. Rubtsov</i>
<p>The Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a powerful tool for calculating
highly correlated systems (both bosonic and fermionic) in a state of
thermodynamic equilibrium. However, in the case of non-equilibrium states, the
method has significant limitations that do not allow obtaining correct results.
The stumbling block here is the impurity solver: a method for calculating the
dynamics of an open system. In this work we present the prototype of a
universal impurity solver for the DMFT method which can solve both equilibrium
and non-equilibrium problems. We analyse spectral functions of Bose-Hubbard
model on the Bethe lattice in different regimes and show that our solver gives
correct and physical results.

<h3>A variational Monte Carlo approach to the SU(4) spin-orbital model on  the triangular lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02639" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02639</a>
<br>
<i>Chun Zhang, Hui-Ke Jin, Yi Zhou</i>
<p>Previous investigations have suggested that the simplest spin-orbital model
on the simplest frustrated lattice can host a nematic quantum spin-orbital
liquid state. Namely, the orbital degeneracy of the SU(4) Kugel-Khomskii (KK)
model tends to enhance quantum fluctuations and stabilize a quantum
spin-orbital liquid exhibiting stripy features on the triangular lattice, as
revealed by the state-of-the-art method of the density matrix renormalization
group boosted by Gutzwiller projected wave functions. In this work, using the
variational quantum Monte Carlo method, we have studied several spin-orbital
liquid states, including a uniform $\pi$ flux state, three stripy states, and a
plaquette state, on the $L\times{}L$ torus up to $L=24$. It turns out that one
of these stripy states, called the ``stripe-II'' state, is energetically
favored. This ground state breaks the $C_6$ symmetry of the lattice, resulting
in a reduced $C_2$ symmetry and doubled unit cells, while preserving the SU(4)
spin-orbital rotation symmetry. Such a nematic quantum spin-orbital liquid
state can be characterized by a parton Fermi surface (FS) consisting of open
orbits in the Brillouin zone, in contrast to the circular FS of the uniform
$\pi$-flux state.

<h3>Magnetic properties of perovskites  Pr$_{0.9}$Sr$_{0.1}$Mn$_{0.9}^{3+}$Mn$_{0.1}^{4+}$O$_{3}$: Monte Carlo  simulations and experiments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02643" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02643</a>
<br>
<i>Y. Essouda, H. T. Diep, M. Ellouze, E.-K. Hlil</i>
<p>This work presents the remarkable experimental magnetocaloric properties of
the perovskites Pr$_{0.9}$Sr$_{0.1}$Mn$_{0.9}^{3+}$Mn$_{0.1}^{4+}$O$_{3}$,
including the magnetic entropy change $|\Delta S_m|$ and the Relative Cooling
Power (RCP). To understand these striking properties, we elaborate in this
paper a model and use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to study it for comparison.
For the model, we take into account nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions between
magnetic ions Mn$^{3+}$($S=2$) and Mn$^{4+}$($S=3/2$) and the interactions
between these Mn ions with the magnetic Pr ions. The crystal is a body-centered
tetragonal lattice where the corner sites are occupied by Mn ions and the
center sites by Pr and Sr ions in their respective concentrations given in the
compound formula. We use an Ising-like spin model. We show that pairwise
interactions between ions cannot reproduce the large plateau of the
magnetization experimentally observed below the phase-transition temperature.
By introducing for the first time a many-spin interaction between Mn ions, we
obtain an excellent agreement with experiments. Fitting the experimental Curie
temperature $T_C$ with the MC transition temperature, we estimate the value of
the effective exchange interaction in the system. From this value, we estimate
various exchange interactions between ions: the dominant one is that between
Mn$^{3+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ which is at the origin of the ferromagnetic ordering
below $T_C$. We also studied the applied-field effect on the magnetization in
the region below and above $T_C$. The obtained MC results for $|\Delta S_m|$
are in agreement with experiments performed for applied fields from 1 to 5
Tesla. MC results of RCP are also shown and compared to experimental ones.

<i>Yulong Zheng, Rahul Venkatesh, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Elsa Reichmanis, Carlos Silva-Acuña</i>
<p>Exciton-exciton annihilation is a ubiquitous nonlinear dynamical phenomenon
in materials hosting Frenkel excitons, that has been employed to probe exciton
diffusion processes in conjugated polymeric materials. In this work, we
investigate the nonlinear exciton dynamics of an electron push-pull conjugated
polymer by fluence-dependent transient absorption and excitation-correlation
photoluminescence spectroscopy, where we can quantitatively show the latter
technique to be a more selective probe of the nonlinear dynamics. Simulations
based on an exciton annihilation model that implements a simple (\textit{i.e.}\
time-independent) bimolecular rate constant decreasing trend for the extracted
annihilation rates with excitation fluence. However, further investigation of
the fluence-dependent transients suggests that the exciton-exciton annihilation
bimolecular rate parameters are not constant in time, displaying a $t^{-1/2}$
time dependence, which we rationalize as reflective of anisotropic exciton
diffusion. At ambient temperature, we estimate the exciton diffusion length to
be $9 \pm 2$\,nm. In addition, exciton annihilation gives rise to a long-lived
species that recombines on a nanosecond timescale. Our conclusions shed broad
light onto nonlinear exciton dynamics in push-pull conjugated polymers.

<h3>Multiparameter universality and intrinsic diversity in weakly  anisotropic bulk and confined systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Volker Dohm</i>
<p>An overview of recent advances in the theory of critical phenomena in
$d$-dimensional weakly anisotropic systems is given. On the basis of a
generalized shear transformation between anisotropic and isotropic systems,
exact and approximate results are discussed for bulk and confined systems in
two and three dimensions where conformal field theory and the minimal
renormalization without $\varepsilon$-expansion play a crucial role.
Stimulation for this research comes from the seminal work by V. Privman and
M.E. Fisher in 1984 in which the principle of two-scale-factor universality for
bulk systems has been extended to finite systems. Based on this principle for
isotropic systems we predict the validity of multiparameter universality with
up to $d(d+1)/2+1$ nonuniversal parameters in $d$-dimensional anisotropic bulk
and confined systems with periodic boundary conditions (BC). The verification
of multiparameter universality for confined anisotropic systems with realistic
BC and the study of the intrinsic diversity of the critical behavior of
magnetic materials, superconductors, liquid crystals, and solids with non-cubic
symmetry are a major challenge to future research.

<p>We report the results of polarization-dependent Raman spectroscopy of phonon
states in single-crystalline quasi-one-dimensional NbTe$_4$ and TaTe$_4$ van
der Waals materials. The measurements were conducted in the wide temperature
range from 80 K to 560 K. Our results show that although both materials have
identical crystal structures and symmetries, there is a drastic difference in
the intensity of their Raman spectra. While TaTe4 exhibits well-defined peaks
through the examined frequency and temperature ranges, NbTe4 reveals extremely
weak Raman signatures. The measured spectral positions of the phonon peaks
agree with the phonon band structure calculated using the density-functional
theory. We offer possible reasons for the in-tensity differences between the
two van der Waals materials. Our results provide insights into the phonon
properties of NbTe$_4$ and TaTe$_4$ van der Waals materials and indicate the
potential of Raman spectroscopy for studying charge-density-wave quantum
condensate phases.

<i>Minh D. N. Nguyen, Phuc H. Pham, Khang V. Ngo, Van H. Do, Shengkai Li, Trung V. Phan</i>
<p>Chemotactic active particles, such as bacteria and cells, exhibit an adaptive
run-and-tumble motion, giving rise to complex emergent behaviors in response to
external chemical fields. This motion is generated by the conversion of
internal chemical energy into self-propulsion, allowing each agent to sustain a
steady-state far from thermal equilibrium and perform works. The rate of
entropy production serves as an indicates of how extensive these agents operate
away from thermal equilibrium, providing a measure for estimating maximum
obtainable power. Here we present the general framework for calculating the
entropy production rate created by such population of agents from the first
principle, using the minimal model of bacterial adaptive chemotaxis, as they
execute the most basic collective action -- the mass transport.

<h3>Digital twins kinetics of virtual free-radical copolymerization of vinyl  monomers with stable radicals. 2. Styrene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02752" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02752</a>
<br>
<i>Elena F. Sheka</i>
<p>The first experience of virtual free-radical copolymerization (FRCP) of
methyl methacrylate with stable radicals fullerene C60 and TEMPO in the
framework of the digital twins (DTs) concept (arXiv:2309.11616
[physics.chem-ph]) is extended to styrene. The virtualization of the chemical
process is based on a conceptual view of this process from the perspective of a
chain reaction that covers a set of elementary reactions (ERs). Such an
approach is the most suitable for quantum chemical treatment. The calculations,
concerning about 50 such ERs as well as associated DTs, were performed using a
semi-empirical version of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation. The main
energy and spin-density parameters of the DTs ground state are determined. The
barrier profiles of the selected DTs were calculated for the activation energy
of the studied reactions to be determined. The decisive role of spins in the
formation of transition states of these processes was confirmed. The two stable
radicals behave quite differently with respect to the standard FRP of styrene.
TEMPO effectively captures monomer-radicals of styrene with the acting free
radical not depending on which namely radical is in use. Its copolymerizing
action manifests itself as a killing of the FRP thus providing the appearance
of an induction period (IP) in the total process kinetics. In contrast, the
copolymerizing action of fullerene drastically depends on the active free
radical. In the case of the alkyl-nitrile one, the fullerene switches to the
role of initiator and first provides the styrene polymerization followed with
anchoring of the formed polymer chains to the molecule body, after which the
standard FRP starts. In the case of benzoyl-peroxide one, fullerene acts an
inhibitor thus capturing formed monomer-radicals. The obtained virtual kinetic
data are in a full consent with experimental reality.

<p>We studied the electronic structure of a layered antiferromagnetic metal,
EuSnP, in the paramagnetic and in the antiferromagnetic phase using angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) alongside density functional theory
(DFT) based first principles calculations. The temperature dependence of the
magnetic susceptibility measurements exhibits an antiferromagnetic transition
at a Neel temperature of 21 K. Employing high resolution ARPES, the valence
band structure was measured at several temperatures above and below the Neel
temperature, which produced identical spectra independent of temperature.
Through analysis of the ARPES results presented here, we attribute the
temperature independent spectra to the weak coupling of the Sn, and P
conduction electrons with Eu 4f states.

<h3>Cavity Induced Topology in Graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Ceren B. Dag, Vasil Rokaj</i>
<p>Strongly coupling materials to cavity modes can affect their electronic
properties altering the phases of matter. We study a setup where graphene
electrons are coupled to chiral photons with both left and right circularly
polarized photons, and time-reversal symmetry is broken due to a phase shift
between them. We develop a many-body perturbative theory, and derive cavity
mediated electronic interactions induced in graphene. This theory leads to a
gap equation which predicts a sizable topological band gap at Dirac nodes in
vacuum and when the cavity is prepared in an excited Fock state. Remarkably,
band gaps also open in light-matter hydbrization points away from the Dirac
nodes giving rise to topological photo-electron bands with high Chern numbers.
We reveal that the physical mechanism behind this phenomenon lies on the
exchange of chiral photons with electronic matter at the hybridization points,
and the number and polarization of exchanged photons determine the Chern
number. This is a generic microscopic mechanism for the photo-electron band
topology. Our theory shows that graphene-based materials, with no need of
Floquet engineering and hence protected from the heating effects, host high
Chern insulator phases when coupled to chiral cavity fields.

<p>Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for
achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic
fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical
techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for
transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically
generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton
wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an
ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon
wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional
spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the
transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric
environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits.
Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical
pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum
mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a
significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der
Waals heterostructures.

<h3>Three-dimensional checkerboard spin structure on a breathing pyrochlore  lattice</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02823" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02823</a>

<i>Margarita G. Dronova, Vaclav Petricek, Zachary Morgan, Feng Ye, Daniel M. Silevitch, Yejun Feng</i>
<p>The standard approach to realize a spin liquid state is through magnetically
frustrated states, relying on ingredients such as the lattice geometry,
dimensionality, and magnetic interaction type of the spins. While Heisenberg
spins on a pyrochlore lattice with only antiferromagnetic nearest neighbors
interactions are theoretically proven disordered, spins in real systems
generally include longer-range interactions. The spatial correlations at longer
distances typically stabilize a long-range order rather than enhancing a spin
liquid state. Both states can, however, be destroyed by short-range static
correlations introduced by chemical disorder. Here, using disorder-free
specimens with a clear long-range antiferromagnetic order, we refine the spin
structure of the Heisenberg spinel ZnFe2O4 through neutron magnetic
diffraction. The unique wave vector (1, 0, 1/2) leads to a spin structure that
can be viewed as alternatively stacked ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
tetrahedra in a three-dimensional checkerboard form. Stable coexistence of
these opposing types of clusters is enabled by the bipartite
breathing-pyrochlore crystal structure, leading to a second order phase
transition at 10 K. The diffraction intensity of ZnFe2O4 is an exact complement
to the inelastic scattering intensity of several chromate spinel systems which
are regarded as model classical spin liquids. Our results challenge this
attribution, and suggest instead of the six-spin ring-mode, spin excitations in
chromate spinels are closely related to the (1, 0, 1/2) type of spin order and
the four-spin ferromagnetic cluster locally at one tetrahedron.

<br>
<i>Jingyao Meng, Runyu Ma, Tianxing Ma, Hai-Qing Lin</i>
<p>Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable
interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study
transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a graphene monolayer with a
special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation
accumulates a series of flat bands, causing a stability under interaction that
is verified through electron localization in real space. During the
reconstruction of the band structure, the flat-band superconductivity appears
with next-nearest neighbor d+id pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is
accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate
that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap
antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of
not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that
exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.

<h3>High-index and low-loss topological insulators for mid-infrared  nanophotonics</h3>

<br>
<i>Sergey G. Menabde, Jacob T. Heiden, Vladimir A. Zenin, N. Asger Mortensen, Min Seok Jang</i>
<p>Topological insulators generally have dielectric bulk and conductive surface
states. Consequently, some of these materials have been shown to support
polaritonic modes at visible and THz frequencies. At the same time, the optical
properties of topological insulators in the mid-infrared (IR) remain poorly
investigated. We employ near-field imaging to probe the mid-IR response from
the exfoliated flakes of bismuth (Bi) / selenide (Se) / telluride (Te) /
antimony (Sb) crystals with varying stoichiometry - Bi2Se3, Bi2Te2Se, and
Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 - in pristine form as well as covered by thin flakes of
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Contrary to theoretical expectations, all three
materials exhibit a dielectric response with a high refractive index and with a
loss below the experimental detection limit. Particularly, the near-field
mapping of propagating phonon-polaritons in hBN demonstrates that these van der
Waals crystals act as a practically lossless dielectric substrate with an
ultra-high refractive index of up to 7.5 in Bi2Te2Se. Such a unique dielectric
crystal would be of great advantage for numerous nanophotonic applications in
the mid-IR.

<h3>Shear zones in granular mixtures of hard and soft particles with high  and low friction</h3>

<br>
<i>Aditya Pratap Singh, Vasileios Angelidakis, Thorsten Pöschel, Sudeshna Roy</i>
<p>Granular materials show inhomogeneous flows characterized by strain
localization. When strain is localized in a sheared granular material, rigid
regions of a nearly undeformed state are separated by shear bands, where the
material yields and flows. The characteristics of the shear bands are
determined by the geometry of the system, the micromechanical material
properties, and the kinematics at the particle level. For a split-bottom shear
cell, recent experimental work has shown that mixtures of hard, frictional and
soft, nearly frictionless particles exhibit wider shear zones than samples with
only one of the two components. To explain this finding, we investigate the
shear zone properties and the stress response of granular mixtures using
discrete element simulations. We show that both interparticle friction and
elastic modulus determine the shear-band properties of granular mixtures of
various mixing ratios, but their stress response depends strongly on the
interparticle friction. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the
micromechanics of shear band formation in granular mixtures.

<h3>Trajectory Extending Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations to Evaluate Pure  and Gas Mixture Diffusivities through a Dense Polymeric Membrane</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02878" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02878</a>
<br>
<i>Subhadeep Dasgupta, Arun K.S, K. Ganapathy Ayappa, Prabal K. Maiti</i>
<p>With renewed interest in CO2 separations, carbon molecular sieving (CMS)
membrane performance evaluation requires diffusion coefficients as inputs to
have reliable estimate of the permeability. An optimal material is desired to
have both high selectivity and permeability. Gases diffusing through dense, CMS
and polymeric membranes experience extended sub-diffusive regimes which hinders
reliable extraction of diffusion coefficients from mean squared displacement
data. We improve the sampling of the diffusive landscape by implementing the
trajectory extending kinetic Monte Carlo (TEKMC) technique to efficiently
extend MD trajectories from ns to {\mu}s timescales. The obtained
self-diffusion coefficient of pure CO2 in CMS membranes derived from
6FDA/BPDA-DAM precursor polymer melt is found in agreement with previous
experimental findings. We also extend the TEKMC algorithm to evaluate the
mixture diffusivities in binary mixtures to determine the permselectivity of
CO2 in CH4 and N2 mixtures. The mixture diffusion coefficient of CO2 ranges
from 1.3-7 x 10^{-6} cm6{2}s^{-1} in binary mixture CO2:CH4 which is
significantly higher than the pure gas diffusion coefficient. Robeson plot
comparisons show that the permselectivity obtained from pure gas diffusion data
are significantly lower than that predicted using mixture diffusivity data.
Specifically in the case of the CO2:N2 mixture we find that using mixture
diffusivities led to permeslectivites lying above the Robeson limit
highlighting the importance of using mixture diffusivity data for an accurate
evaluation of the membrane performance. Combined with gas solubilities obtained
from grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations, our work shows that simulations
with the TEKMC method can be used to reliably evaluate the performance of
materials for gas separations.

<p>We investigated the resonant tunneling of a two-spin system through the
double quantum dots in Al-N-implanted silicon tunnel FETs (TFETs) by
electrical-transport measurements and Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana
interferometry with and without magnetic fields. Our experimental results
revealed the coexistence of spin-conserving and spin-flip tunneling channels in
the two-spin system in non-zero magnetic fields. Additionally, we obtained the
spin-conserving/spin-flip tunneling rates of the two-spin system through the
double quantum dots in the TFET. These findings will improve our understanding
of the two-spin system in silicon TFET qubits and may facilitate the coherent
control of quantum states through all-electric manipulation.

<h3>Deciphering core-exciton dynamics in CaF$_2$ with attosecond  spectroscopy</h3>

<br>
<i>Rafael Quintero-Bermudez Stephen R. Leone</i>
<p>Core excitons in solids have garnered increasing interest, yet their behavior
and decay mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we use attosecond extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy, performed with a broadband
25-45 eV sub-fs XUV pump pulse and a 500-1000 nm sub 5 fs near-infrared (NIR)
supercontinuum probe pulse to monitor the excitation, dynamics, and decay of
core excitons in CaF$_2$ at the Ca$^{2+}$ M$_{2,3}$ edge. The XUV pulses are
used to excite core excitons in CaF$_2$ based around the Ca$^{2+}$ and the
polarization of the medium is subsequently perturbed by the time-delayed NIR
pulses to measure the spectral changes and decays. A number of features are
identified in the transient absorption spectrum, which suggest transfer between
excitonic states, Stark shifts, and the emergence of light-induced states. We
find that various core excitons identified exhibit coherence lifetimes spanning
3-7 fs. Furthermore, a NIR-intensity-dependent analysis finds a negative
correlation with the coherence lifetime of various identified excitonic
features, supporting a phonon-mediated mechanism as responsible for the core
exciton decoherence. We present a computational band structure projection
analysis strategy to estimate the orbital structure of the core excitons and
determine which core excitonic transitions should be allowed by selection rules
with the probe beam. This strategy is found to successfully describe the
observed spectroscopic data. The outlined joint spectroscopic and computational
investigation of core excitons is a powerful technique that explains the
complex behavior of core excitons in solid-state materials.

<p>The notion of topological insulators (TIs), characterized by an insulating
bulk and conducting topological surface states, can be extended to higher-order
topological insulators (HOTIs) hosting gapless modes localized at the
boundaries of two or more dimensions lower than the insulating bulk1-5. In this
work, by performing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements with submicron spatial and spin resolutions, we
systematically investigate the electronic structure and spin texture of
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) HOTI candidate Bi4Br4. In contrast to the
bulk-state-dominant spectra on the (001) surface, we observe gapped surface
states on the (100) surface, whose dispersion and spin-polarization agree well
with our ab initio calculations. Moreover, we reveal in-gap states connecting
the surface valence and conduction bands, which is an explicit signature of the
existence of hinge states inside the (100) surface gap. Our findings provide
compelling evidence for the HOTI phase of Bi4Br4. The identification of the
higher-order topological phase will lay the promising prospect of applications
based on 1D spin-momentum locked current in electronic and spintronic devices.

<p>The $\alpha/\beta$ interface is central to the microstructure and mechanical
properties of titanium alloys. We investigate the structure, thermodynamics and
migration of the coherent and semicoherent Ti $\alpha/\beta$ interfaces as a
function of temperature and misfit strain via molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, thermodynamic integration and an accurate, DFT-trained Deep
Potential. The structure of an equilibrium semicoherent interface consists of
an array of steps, an array of misfit dislocations, and coherent terraces.
Analysis determines the dislocation and step (disconnection) array structure
and habit plane. The MD simulations show the detailed interface morphology
dictated by intersecting disconnection arrays. The steps are shown to
facilitate $\alpha/\beta$ interface migration, while the misfit dislocations
lead to interface drag; the drag mechanism is different depending on the
direction of interface migration. These results are used to predict the nature
of $\alpha$ phase nucleation on cooling through the $\alpha$-$\beta$ phase
transition.

<h3>Microwave generation and vortex jets in superconductor nanotubes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02946" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02946</a>
<br>
<i>Igor Bogush, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy, Vladimir M. Fomin</i>
<p>The dynamics of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) determine the
resistive response of superconductors. In pinning-free planar thin films, the
penetration and motion of vortices are controlled by edge defects, leading to
such arrangements as vortex chains, vortex jets, and phase-slip regimes. Here,
relying upon the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we predict that these
vortex patterns should appear in superconductor open nanotubes even without
edge defects, due to the inhomogeneity of the normal magnetic induction
component $B_\mathrm{n}$, caused by the 3D tube geometry. The crossing of the
half-tubes by dc-driven vortices induces GHz-frequency voltage $U$ oscillations
with spectra $U_\mathrm{f}(B)$ evolving between $nf_1$ and $\frac{n}{m}f_1$
[$f_1$: vortex nucleation frequency; $n,m\geq 2$] and blurred in certain ranges
of currents and fields. An $nf_1$-spectrum corresponds to a single vortex-chain
regime typical for low $B$ and for tubes of small radii. At higher fields, an
$\frac{n}{m}f_1$-spectrum points to the presence of $m$ vortex chains in the
vortex jets which, in contrast to planar thin films, are not diverging because
of constraint to the tube areas where $B_\mathrm{n}$ is close to maximum. A
blurry spectrum implies complex arrangements of vortices because of
multifurcations of their trajectories. Finally, due to a stronger confinement
of single vortex chains in tubes of small radii, we reveal peaks in $dU/dB$ and
jumps in the frequency of microwave generation, which occur when the number of
fluxons moving in the half-tubes increases by one. In all, our findings are
essential for novel 3D superconductor devices which can operate in few- and
multi-fluxon regimes.

<h3>Non-ballistic Thermal Transport in Carbon Nanotubes</h3>

<i>Ankit Jain</i>
<p>The thermal transport properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are
re-investigated using the iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport
equation by including four-phonon scattering. Using only three-phonon
scattering, the flexural and twisted phonon modes are found to remain
non-scattered via Umklapp processes, resulting in the literature-reported
divergence of thermal conductivity with tube length. However, with four-phonon
scattering, while longitudinal modes remain unaffected, the otherwise
non-scattered transverse modes undergo Umklapp scattering and result in a
non-ballistic transport, thus settling a decades-long debate on the length
dependence of thermal conductivity of SWCNTs. The predicted thermal
conductivity of SWCNTs using both three- and four-phonon scatterings is 3700
W/m-K at 300 K and stays highest amongst all known materials.

<h3>Understanding Phonon Thermal Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h3>

<br>
<i>Shahid Ahmed, Shadab Alam, Ankit Jain</i>
<p>The phonon thermal transport properties of twisted bi-layer graphene are
investigated using lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation. The
thermal conductivities of 13.2 and 21.8 twisted configurations are 56% and 36%
lower than the untwisted configuration which has a room temperature thermal
conductivity of 2260 W/m-K. The reason for this lower thermal conductivity is
unraveled from phonon mode-level analysis made possible through the untwisting
of layers. Due to a large commensurate unitcell of twisted configuration, the
Brillouin zone is folded but this folding has no bearing on the phonon
scattering phase space. The major impact of twisting is felt by flexural
phonons with out-of-plane vibrations via the change in strength of flexural
interatomic interactions and since these flexural phonons carry majority of the
heat in bilayer graphene (65% at room temperature), the thermal conductivity is
sensitive to layer twisting. Our study suggests that twisting will affect
thermal transport only for those materials that have a major contribution from
flexural phonon modes.

theoretically and numerically how mechanical frustration controls the
underlying potential energy landscape. Then, we examine the harmonic 4-mass

self-driven rearrangements. We show such configurational dynamics may occur

<p>Materials incorporating covalent adaptive networks (CAN), e.g., vitrimers,
have received significant scientific attention due to their distinctive
attributes of self-healing and stimuli-responsive properties. Different from
direct crosslinked systems, bivalent and multivalent systems require a bond
swap algorithm that respects detailed balance, considering the multiple
equilibria in the system. Here we propose a simple and robust algorithm to
handle bond swap in multivalent and multi-species CAN systems. By including a
bias term in the acceptance of Monte Carlo moves, we eliminate the imbalance
from the bond swap site selection and multivalency effects, ensuring the
detailed balance for all species in the system.

<i>Maximilian Bailey, Dmitry Fedosov, Federico Paratore, Fabio Grillo, Gerhard Gompper, Lucio Isa</i>
<p>The generation of fluid flows by autophoretic microswimmers has been proposed
as a mechanism to enhance mass transport at the micro- and nanoscale. Here, we
experimentally investigate the ability of model "active baths" of
photocatalytic silica-titania Janus microspheres to enhance the diffusivity of
tracer particles at different microswimmer densities excluding collective
effects. Inspired by the similarities between our experimental findings and
previous results for biological microorganisms, we also model our Janus
microswimmers using a general squirmer framework. The numerical simulations
faithfully capture our observations, offer an insight into the microscopic
mechanism underpinning tracer transport, and allow us to expand the parameter
space beyond our experimental system. We find strong evidence for a
collision-based mechanism for increased tracer diffusivity, which leads to the
identification of an operating window for enhanced tracer transport by chemical
microswimmers based on dimensionless scaling arguments.

<i>Zhan-Long Wang, Haonan Zhao, Zhen Xu, He Hong</i>
<p>Vapor sink is an effective strategy to suppress the formation of water vapor
condensation around hygroscopic materials, and consequently reduce frosting and
icing. However, traditionally used materials, such as salt solutions, fibers,
exhibit insufficient condensation inhibition or pose safety concerns, such as
corrosiveness. In this study, we highlight the remarkable anti-condensation
properties of glycerol droplets, attributed to their strong hygroscopicity. We
compared the anti-condensation capabilities of glycerol droplets with commonly
used salt solutions and hygroscopic alcohols. The results indicated that
glycerol droplets establish a relatively expansive dry zone where the
condensation is effectively inhibited, while also offering safety compared to
other materials. Furthermore, we conducted a systematic study of the
anti-condensation properties of glycerol droplets with experiments and
theoretical analysis. We explored the varying trends of the dry zone ratio
concerning temperature, cooling time, humidity, and droplet volume on
hydrophobic surfaces. To provide a comprehensive understanding, we propose a
straightforward yet robust theoretical model that elucidates the relationship
between this ratio and temperature, aligning well with the experimental data.
Our study not only sheds light on the superior anti-condensation qualities of
glycerol but also offers insights and guidelines for the development of
effective anti-icing and anti-frost materials.

<p>Ultracold atomic systems have emerged as strong contenders amongst the

ring-shaped quantum gas of strongly interacting \textit{N}-component fermions,
specifically the so-called SU(\textit{N}) fermions. Our results, apart from
being a relevant contribution to many-body physics, prove the `primum mobile'

platforms, opening an exciting chapter in the field of atomtronics. Indeed, the
specific properties of quantization are expected to provide the core to
fabricate quantum devices with enhanced sensitivity like interferometers. At

<p>A novel complex-phase steel alloy is conceived with a deliberately unstable
austenite, $\gamma$, phase that enables the deformation-induced martensitic
transformations (DIMT) to be explored at low levels of plastic strain. The DIMT
was thus explored, in-situ and non-destructively, using both far-field
Three-Dimensional X-Ray Diffraction (3DXRD) and Electron Back-Scatter
Diffraction (EBSD). Substantial $\alpha'$ martensite formation was observed
under 10% applied strain with EBSD, and many $\varepsilon$ grain formation
events were captured with 3DXRD, indicative of the indirect transformation of
martensite via the reaction $\gamma \rightarrow \varepsilon \rightarrow
\alpha'$. Using $\varepsilon$ grain formation as a direct measurement of
$\gamma$ grain stability, the influence of several microstructural properties,
such as grain size, orientation and neighbourhood configuration, on $\gamma$
stability have been identified. Larger $\gamma$ grains were found to be less
stable than smaller grains. Any $\gamma$ grains oriented with {100} parallel to
the loading direction preferentially transformed with lower stresses. Parent
$\varepsilon$-forming $\gamma$ grains possessed a neighbourhood with increased
ferritic/martensitic volume fraction. This finding shows, unambiguously, that
$\alpha$/$\alpha'$ promotes $\varepsilon$ formation in neighbouring grains. The
minimum strain work criterion model for $\varepsilon$ variant prediction was
also evaluated, which worked well for most grains. However,
$\varepsilon$-forming grains with a lower stress were less well predicted by
the model, indicating crystal-level behaviour must be considered for accurate
$\varepsilon$ formation. The findings from this work are considered key for the
future design of alloys where the deformation response can be controlled by
tailoring microstructure and local or macroscopic crystal orientations.

<h3>Quasi one-dimensional organic conductors: from Fröhlich conductivity  and Peierls insulating state to magnetically-mediated superconductivity, a  retrospective</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03104" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03104</a>
<br>
<i>Denis Jerome, Claude Bourbonnais</i>
<p>It is indisputable that the search for high-temperature superconductivity has
stimulated the work on low-dimensional organic conductors at its beginning.
Since the discovery of true metal-like conduction in molecular compounds more
than 50 years ago, it appeared that the chemical composition and the quasi
one-dimensional crystalline structure of these conductors were determining
factors for their physical properties; materials with incommensurate conduction
band filling favoring the low-dimensional electron-phonon diverging channel and
the establishment of the Peierls superstructure and more rarely
superconductivity at low temperature, while those with commensurate band
filling favor either magnetic insulating or superconducting states depending on
the intensity of the coupling between conductive chains. In addition, the
simple structures of these materials have allowed the development of
theoretical models in close cooperation with almost all experimental findings.
Even though these materials have not yet given rise to true high-temperature
superconductivity, the wealth of their physical properties makes them systems
of choice in the field of condensed matter physics due to their original
properties and their educational qualities. Research efforts continue in this
field. The present retrospective, which does not attempt to be an exhaustive
review of the field, provides a set of experimental findings alluding to the
theoretical development while a forthcoming article will address in more
details the theoretical aspect of low dimensional conductors and
superconductors.

<h3>End-to-end Material Thermal Conductivity Prediction through Machine  Learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03139" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03139</a>
<br>
<i>Yagyank Srivastava, Ankit Jain</i>
<p>We investigated the accelerated prediction of the thermal conductivity of
materials through end- to-end structure-based approaches employing machine
learning methods. Due to the non-availability of high-quality thermal
conductivity data, we first performed high-throughput calculations based on
first principles and the Boltzmann transport equation for 225 materials,
effectively more than doubling the size of the existing dataset. We assessed
the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning models for thermal
conductivity prediction on this expanded dataset and observed that all these
models suffered from overfitting. To address this issue, we introduced a novel
graph-based neural network model, which demonstrated more consistent and
regularized performance across all evaluated datasets. Nevertheless, the best
mean absolute percentage error achieved on the test dataset remained in the
range of 50-60%. This suggests that while these models are valuable for
expediting material screening, their current accuracy is still limited.

<h3>Plasmons in a layered strange metal using the gauge-gravity duality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03142" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03142</a>
<br>
<i>S.T. Van den Eede, T.J.N. van Stralen, C.F.J. Flipse, H.T.C. Stoof</i>
<p>In an attempt to understand the density-density response of the cuprate
superconductors, we study plasmons in a layered strange metal using the
Gubser-Rocha model. The latter is a well-known bottom-up holographic model for
a strange metal that is used here to describe the strongly repulsive on-site
interactions between the electrons in each copper-oxide (CuO$_2$) layer,
whereas the long-range Coulomb interactions are incorporated by a so-called
double-trace deformation. To be able to model the bilayer cuprates more
realistically, we consider in particular the case of two closely-spaced CuO$_2$
layers per unit cell. In the response we then obtain for vanishing out-of-plane
momentum both an optical and an acoustic plasmon, whereas for nonvanishing
out-of-plane momentum there are two acoustic plasmon modes. We present the full
density-density spectral functions with parameters typical for cuprates and
discuss both the dispersion and the lifetime of these plasmon excitations.
Moreover, we compute the conductivity after introducing disorder into the
system. Finally, we also compute the loss function to facilitate a comparison
with experimental results from electron energy loss spectroscopy.

<h3>Cross-Plane Thermal Transport in Layered Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03144</a>
<br>
<i>Amey G. Gokhale, Ankit Jain</i>
<p>The cross-plane (across-layers) phonon thermal transport of five diverse,
layered semiconductors is investigated by accounting for higher-order
four-phonon scattering, phonon renormalization, and multi-channel thermal
transport. For materials having relatively large cross-plane thermal
conductivity (AlB6, MoS2, and MoSi2N4), phonons contributing to cross-plane
conductivity have an order of magnitude larger mean free path than that for the
basal-plane thermal transport, whereas the opposite effect is observed for
materials with low thermal conductivity (MoO3 and KCuSe). The contribution from
the wave-like coherent transport channel is less than 5% in all considered
materials. Our work unravels the contrasting role of nano-structuring on the
basal- vs. cross-plane thermal conductivity of low and high thermal
conductivity layered materials.

<h3>Controlling effective field contributions to laser-induced magnetization  precession by heterostructure design</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03158" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03158</a>
<br>
<i>Jasmin Jarecki, Maximilian Mattern, Fried-Conrad Weber, Jan-Etienne Pudell, Xi-Guang Wang, Juan-Carlos Rojas Sánchez, Michel Hehn, Alexander von Reppert, Matias Bargheer</i>
<p>We experimentally demonstrate how nanoscale heterostructure design controls
the effects of laser-induced heat and strain on the magnetization precession.
By introducing insulating MgO layers into metallic Pt-Cu-Ni heterostructures we
block the propagation of hot electrons to control the magnetization dynamics by
tailoring the spatio-temporal shape of the transient heat and strain, which we
quantify by ultrafast x-ray diffraction experiments. We access the
corresponding magnetization precession in these heterostructures using the
time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect in polar geometry for varying
magnetic field orientations. Our analysis and modeling highlights the
importance of quasi-static strain as a driver of precession, which counteracts
the demagnetization-induced precession in situations where the magnetic
material is rapidly heated via electrons. Tailored strain pulses shaped via
nanoscale heterostructure design paves the way for opto-magneto-acoustic
devices prepared by sputtering.

<h3>Phase-field simulations of the effect of temperature and interface for  zirconium $δ\mbox{-}$hydrides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03162</a>
<br>
<i>Zi-Hang Chen, Jie Sheng, Yu Liu, Xiao-Ming Shi, Houbing Huang, Ke Xu, Yue-Chao Wang, Shuai Wu, Bo Sun, Hai-Feng Liu, Hai-Feng Song</i>
<p>Hydride precipitation in zirconium cladding materials can damage their
integrity and durability.Service temperature and material defects have a
significant effect on the dynamic growth of hydrides. In this study, we have
developed a phase field model based on the assumption of elastic behaviour
within a specific temperature range (613-653K). This model allows us to study
the influence of temperature and interfacial effects on the morphology, stress,
and average growth rate of zirconium hydride. The results suggest that changes
in temperature and interfacial energy influence the aspect ratio and average
growth rate of the hydride morphology. The ultimate determinant of hydride
orientation is the loss of interfacial coherence, primarily induced by
interfacial dislocation defects and quantifiable by the mismatch degree $q$. An
escalation in interfacial coherence loss leads to a transition of hydride
growth from horizontal to vertical, accompanied by the onset of redirection
behaviour. Interestingly, redirection occurs at a critical mismatch level,
denoted $q_c$, and remains unaffected by variations in temperature and
interfacial energy. However, this redirection leads to an increase in the
maximum stress, which may influence the direction of hydride crack propagation.
This research highlights the importance of interfacial coherence and provides
valuable insights into the morphology and growth kinetics of hydrides in
zirconium alloys.

<br>
<i>Firat Yalcin, Michael Wolloch</i>
<p>We introduce SurfFlow, an open-source high-throughput workflow package
designed for automated first-principles calculations of surface energies in
arbitrary crystals. Our package offers a comprehensive solution capable of
handling multi-element crystals, nonstoichiometric compositions, and asymmetric
slabs, for all potential terminations. To streamline the computational process,
SurfFlow employs an efficient pre-screening method that discards surfaces with
suspected high surface energy before conducting resource-intensive density
functional theory computations. The results generated are seamlessly compiled
into an optimade-compliant database, ensuring easy access and compatibility.
Additionally, a user-friendly web interface facilitates workflow submission and
management, provides result visualization, and enables the examination of Wulff
shapes. SurfFlow represents a valuable tool for researchers looking to explore
surface energies and their implications in a diverse range of systems.

<h3>Flat band based delocalized-to-localized transitions in a non-Hermitian  diamond chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03166" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03166</a>
<br>
<i>Hui Liu, Zhanpeng Lu, Xu Xia, Zhihao Xu</i>
<p>In this paper, we investigate the influence of quasiperiodic perturbations on
one-dimensional non-Hermitian diamond lattices that possess flat bands with an
artificial magnetic flux $\theta$. Our study shows that the symmetry of these
perturbations and the magnetic flux $\theta$ play a pivotal role in shaping the
localization properties of the system. When $\theta=0$, the non-Hermitian
lattice exhibits a single flat band in the crystalline case, and symmetric as
well as antisymmetric perturbations can induce accurate mobility edges. In
contrast, when $\theta=\pi$, the clean diamond lattice manifests three
dispersionless bands referred to as an "all-band-flat" (ABF) structure,
irrespective of the non-Hermitian parameter. The ABF structure restricts the
transition from delocalized to localized states, as all states remain localized
for any finite symmetric perturbation. Our numerical calculations further
unveil that the ABF system subjected to antisymmetric perturbations exhibits
multifractal-to-localized edges. Multifractal states are predominantly
concentrated in the internal region of the spectrum. Additionally, we explore
the case where $\theta$ lies within the range of $(0, \pi)$, revealing a
diverse array of complex localization features within the system.

<h3>Neutralization of impurities by cw-excitation of high-$n$  Rydberg-excitons</h3>

<i>Julian Heckötter, Binodbihari Panda, Katharina Brägelmann, Marc Aßmann</i>
<p>We investigate the neutralization of charged defects in a Cu$_2$O crystal
experimentally with a cw two-color pump-probe setup. We demonstrate that the
excitation of high-lying Rydberg excitons at low densities generates an
enhancement of exciton absorption up to a factor of 3. The result is an overall
improvement of the absorption spectrum's quality in terms of increased
oscillator strengths and narrower linewidths, referred to as purification. The
reduction of the amount of charged impurities in the crystal is further
verified by a thorough analysis of impurity photoluminescence signals.

<h3>Nonuniform Bose-Einstein condensate. II. Doubly coherent states</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03176" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03176</a>
<br>
<i>Maksim Tomchenko</i>
<p>We find stationary excited states of a one-dimensional system of $N$ spinless
point bosons with repulsive interaction and zero boundary conditions by
numerically solving the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The
solutions are compared with the exact ones found in the Bethe-ansatz approach.
We show that the $j$th stationary excited state of a nonuniform condensate of
atoms corresponds to a Bethe-ansatz solution with the quantum numbers
$n_{1}=n_{2}=\ldots =n_{N}=j+1$. On the other hand, such $n_{1},\ldots,n_{N}$
correspond to a condensate of $N$ elementary excitations (these are Bogoliubov
quasiparticles with the quasimomentum $\hbar \pi j/L$, where $L$ is the system
size). Thus, each stationary excited state of the condensate is ``doubly
coherent'', since it corresponds simultaneously to a condensate of $N$ atoms
and a condensate of $% N$ elementary excitations. We find the energy $E$ and
the particle density profile $\rho (x)$ for such states. The possibility of
experimental production of these states is also discussed.

<p>The recent realization of a two-site Kitaev chain featuring "poor man's
Majorana" states demonstrates a path forward in the field of topological
superconductivity. Harnessing the potential of these states for quantum
information processing, however, requires increasing their robustness to
external perturbations. Here, we form a two-site Kitaev chain using
proximitized quantum dots hosting Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. The strong
hybridization between such states and the superconductor enables the creation
of poor man's Majorana states with a gap larger than $70 \mathrm{~\mu eV}$. It
also greatly reduces the charge dispersion compared to Kitaev chains made with
non-proximitized quantum dots. The large gap and reduced sensitivity to charge
fluctuations will benefit qubit manipulation and demonstration of non-abelian
physics using poor man's Majorana states.

<h3>Exploiting polarization dependence in two dimensional coherent  spectroscopy: examples of Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03200" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03200</a>
<br>
<i>Mark Potts, Roderich Moessner, Owen Benton</i>
<p>Two dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) probes the nonlinear optical
response of correlated systems. An interesting application is the study of
fractionalized excitations, which are challenging to distinguish unambiguously
in linear response. Here we demonstrate how the sensitivity of optical matrix
elements to variations in the photon polarization allows one to probe different
aspects of low lying excitations in models of the candidate fractionalized
materials Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which host effective
one-dimensional spin chains when subjected to a [110] magnetic field. We show
how both fractionalized spinon excitations or conventional magnons can be
picked out in the 2DCS response, and how the response from polarized spin
chains can be used to probe the dipolar-octupolar mixing angle $\theta$ through
the relative intensity of one- and two-magnon signals. Further, we find that a
$[001]$ polarization of the probe field is particularly sensitive to lower band
edge of the spinon continuum and can be used as a measure of the proximity of a
quantum critical point in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. 2DCS can thus be employed to
provide invaluable and detailed information both on the constituent degrees of
freedom of a quantum material and on their collective behaviour.

<i>Sebastiaan L.D. ten Haaf, Qingzhen Wang, A. Mert Bozkurt, Chun-Xiao Liu, Ivan Kulesh, Philip Kim, Di Xiao, Candice Thomas, Michael J. Manfra, Tom Dvir, Michael Wimmer, Srijit Goswami</i>
<p>Artificial Kitaev chains can be used to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs)
in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this work, we realize a two-site
Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) by coupling two quantum
dots (QDs) through a region proximitized by a superconductor. We demonstrate
systematic control over inter-dot couplings through in-plane rotations of the
magnetic field and via electrostatic gating of the proximitized region. This
allows us to tune the system to sweet spots in parameter space, where robust
correlated zero bias conductance peaks are observed in tunnelling spectroscopy.
To study the extent of hybridization between localized MBSs, we probe the
evolution of the energy spectrum with magnetic field and estimate the Majorana
polarization, an important metric for Majorana-based qubits. The implementation
of a Kitaev chain on a scalable and flexible 2D platform provides a realistic
path towards more advanced experiments that require manipulation and readout of
multiple MBSs.

<h3>Interpretation of EMF data in Ag-Au-S system</h3>

<i>Ya.I. Korepanov</i>
<p>The EMF dependencies for Ag-Au-S systems were analyzed and it was found that
the reactions described in reference [1] are inaccurate. Additionally, the
assumption that the equilibrium state of Au remains unchanged during the
measurement process was shown to be incorrect. Based on the EMF data provided
in White's 1957 paper, the compositions of the alloys involved in the reactions
were determined. The reaction equations were then modified to include
temperature dependencies of the alloy composition. The resulting equations are
as follows: 1/(1-x)Ag(cr) + Ag3AuS2(cr) = 2Ag2S(cr) + 1/(1-x)AgxAu1-x, x=+
0,4535-3,513-4 T 1/(1-x)Ag(cr) + 2AgAuS(cr) = Ag3AuS2(cr) + 1/(1-x)AgxAu1-x,
x=0,3092-3,341-4 T 1/(1-x)Ag(cr) + Au2S(cr) = AgAuS(cr) + 1/(1-x)AgxAu1-x, x=
-0,0131+5,769*10-5 T The validity of these reaction equations was demonstrated,
and the accurate thermodynamic functions for the phases were determined based
on these equations.

<i>Levi Hoogendoorn, Mauricio Huertas, Phillip Nitz, Naiyu Qi, Johannes Baller, Carsten Prinz, Gustav Graeber</i>
<p>Sorbents are promising materials for applications in atmospheric water
harvesting, thermal energy storage, and passive cooling, thereby addressing
central challenges related to water scarcity and the global energy transition.
Recently, hygroscopic hydrogel composites have emerged as high-performance
sorbents. However, many of these systems are fabricated with unsustainable and
costly sorbent materials, which hinders their wide deployment. Here, the
synthesis of high-performance, cost-efficient polyacrylamide hydrogels loaded
with unprecedented amounts of calcium chloride is demonstrated. To this end,
the swelling procedure of polyacrylamide hydrogels in aqueous calcium chloride
solutions is optimized. The obtained salt loading in the hydrogel is
characterized as a function of temperature, calcium chloride concentration in
the swelling solution, and the hydrogel preparation conditions. The obtained
hydrogel-salt composites are shown to be stable under repeated
sorption-desorption cycling and enable water uptakes of 0.92 and 2.38 gram of
water per gram of dry materials at 30% and 70% relative humidity, respectively.
The resulting cost-performance ratio substantially exceeds the
state-of-the-art. The mechanistic insights on hydrogel salt interactions can
guide the design of sustainable and low-cost sorbent materials for future
applications in water and energy.

<h3>Current-induced spin polarization in chiral Tellurium: a  first-principles quantum transport study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03219" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03219</a>
<br>
<i>Reena Gupta, Andrea Droghetti</i>
<p>Te is a naturally p-doped semiconductor with a chiral structure, where an
electrical current causes the conduction electrons to become spin polarized
parallel to the transport direction. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
theoretical study of this effect by employing density functional theory (DFT)
combined with the non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) technique for
quantum transport. We suggest that the spin polarization can quantitatively be
estimated in terms of two complementary quantities, namely the non-equilibrium
magnetic moments and the spin current density. The calculated magnetic moments
are directly compared with the values from previous theoretical studies
obtaining overall consistent results. On the other hand, the inspection of the
spin current density provides insights of the magnetotransport properties of
the material. Specifically, we predict that the resistance along a Te wire
changes when an external magnetic field is applied parallel or antiparallel to
the charge current direction. The computed magnetoresistance is however quite
small (~ 0.025%). Finally, we show that the description of the current-induced
spin polarization in terms of the spin current establishes a straightforward
connection with the phenomenon called chiral-induced spin selectivity, recently
observed in several nano-junctions.

<p>We probe the magnetic field-induced Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) state in
the bond-alternating spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) chain compound
NaVOPO$_4$ using thermodynamic as well as local $\mu$SR and $^{31}$P NMR probes
down to milli-K temperatures in magnetic fields up to 14~T. The $\mu$SR and NMR
relaxation rates in the gapless TLL regime decay slowly following
characteristic power-law behaviour, enabling us to directly determine the
interaction parameter $K$ as a function of the magnetic field. These estimates
are cross-checked using magnetization and specific heat data. The
field-dependent $K$ lies in the range of $0.4 < K < 1$ and indicates repulsive
nature of interactions between the spinless fermions, in line with the
theoretical predictions. This renders NaVOPO$_4$ the first experimental
realization of TLL with repulsive fermionic interactions in hitherto studied
$S=1/2$ bond-alternating AFM-AFM chain compounds.

<br>
<i>Sebastian Ziegler, Megan Delens, Ylona Collard, Maxime Hubert, Nicolas Vandewalle, Ana-Sunčana Smith</i>
<p>In nature, metachronal coordination is an efficient strategy for fluid
pumping and self-propulsion. Yet, mimetic systems for this type of organization
are scarce. Recently, metachronal motion was observed in a bead-based
magnetocapillary mesoswimmer, but the mechanism of such device's behavior
remained unclear. Here, we combine theory and experiments to explain two
swimming regimes that we identify by modulation of the driving frequency. In
the linear, low-frequency regime, the swimmer motion originates from individual
bead rotations. However, the high-frequency, metachronal regime is dominated by
deformations of the device near a mechanical resonance, which highlights the
role of bead inertia for optimized self-propulsion.

<i>H. J. Ehrich, A. Dollmann, P. G. Grützmacher, C. Gachot, S. J. Eder</i>
<p>Deformation twinning significantly influences the microstructure, texture,
and mechanical properties of metals, necessitating comprehensive studies of
twin formation and interactions. While experimental methods excel at analyzing
individual samples, they often lack the capability for temporal analysis of
twinned structures. Molecular dynamics simulations offer a temporal dimension,
yet the absence of suitable tools for automated crystal twin identification has
been a significant limitation. In this article, we introduce a novel
computational tool integrated into the visualization and analysis software
OVITO. Our tool automates the identification of coherent twin boundaries, links
related twin boundaries, validates twin structures through orientation
analysis, and tracks twins over time, providing quantifiable data and enabling
in-depth investigations. Validation on a copper single crystal under shear
loading demonstrates successful tracking of various twins, revealing their
genesis and growth over multiple timesteps. This innovative approach promises
to advance the computational materials science domain by facilitating the study
of deformation twinning, offering profound insights into the behavior and
mechanical performance of materials.

<h3>Quasi long-ranged order in two-dimensional active liquid crystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03276" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03276</a>
<br>
<i>Livio Nicola Carenza, Josep-Maria Armengol-Collado, Dimitrios Krommydas, Luca Giomi</i>
<p>Quasi-long ranged order is the hallmark of two-dimensional liquid crystals.
At equilibrium, this property implies that the correlation function of the
local orientational order parameter decays with distance as a power law: i.e.
$\sim|\boldsymbol{r}|^{-\eta_{p}}$, with $\eta_{p}$ a temperature-dependent
exponent. While in general non-universal, $\eta_{p}=1/4$ universally at the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where orientational order is lost
because of the unbinding of disclinations. Motivated by recent experimental
findings of liquid crystal order in confluent cell monolayers, here we
demonstrate that, in {\em active} liquid crystals, the notion of quasi-long
ranged order fundamentally differs from its equilibrium counterpart and is
ultimately dictated by the interplay between translational and orientational
dynamics. As a consequence, the exponent $\eta_{p}$ is allowed to vary in the
range $0<\eta_{p}\le 2$, with the upper bound corresponding to the isotropic
phase. Our theoretical predictions are supported by a survey of recent
experimental data, reflecting a wide variety of different realization of
orientational order in two dimensions.

<p>Flat bands coupled with magnetism and topological orders near or at the Fermi
level are well known to drive exotic correlation physics and unconventional
superconductivity. Here, based on first-principles modeling combined with an
in-depth symmetry analysis, we reveal the presence of topological flat bands
involving low-energy Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ states in the recently discovered
superconductor LaNiO$_{2}$. Our analysis demonstrates that LaNiO$_2$ is an
Axion insulator with $\mathbb{Z}_{4} = 2$ and that it supports topological
crystalline insulating states protected by the glide mirror symmetries. The
topological flat bands in LaNiO$_{2}$ are also shown to host odd-parity
superconductivity. Our study indicates that the nickelates would provide an
interesting materials platform for exploring the interplay of flat bands,
topological states, and superconductivity.

<p>The folding processes of RNA and DNA play crucial roles in biological systems
and nanotechnology. However, studying these processes with high-resolution
models is beyond current computational capabilities. In this article, we
present a new coarse-grained model for investigating the folding dynamics of
nucleic acids. Our model represents n nucleotides using a single patchy
particle and is parametrized using well-established nearest-neighbor models. By
simplifying the system and interactions, our model allows for simulations at
timescales and length scales that are currently inaccessible to more detailed
models. To validate the performance of our model, we conducted extensive
simulations of various single-stranded systems. We examined the thermodynamics
of DNA hairpins, capturing their stability and structural transitions. We also
investigated the folding of an MMTV pseudoknot, a complex RNA structure
involved in viral replication. Furthermore, we explored the folding of a
challenging RNA tile containing a k-type pseudoknot. The new coarse-grained
model accurately captures the folding behavior of diverse nucleic acid
structures, providing insights into their thermodynamics. The successful
reproduction of experimental data and favorable comparisons with existing
coarse-grained models validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<i>Will Holdhusen, Daniel Huerga, Gerardo Ortiz</i>
<p>The Kitaev spin liquid, stabilized as the ground state of the Kitaev
honeycomb model, is a paradigmatic example of a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$
quantum spin liquid. The fate of the Kitaev spin liquid in presence of an
external magnetic field is a topic of current interest due to experiments,
which apparently unveil a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in the so-called
Kitaev materials, and theoretical studies predicting the emergence of an
intermediate quantum phase of debated nature before the appearance of a trivial
partially polarized phase. In this work, we employ hierarchical mean-field
theory, an algebraic and numerical method based on the use of clusters
preserving relevant symmetries and short-range quantum correlations, to
investigate the quantum phase diagram of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev's model
in a [111] field. By using clusters of 24 sites, we predict that the Kitaev
spin liquid transits through two intermediate phases characterized by stripe
and chiral order, respectively, before entering the trivial partially polarized
phase, differing from previous studies. We assess our results by performing
exact diagonalization and computing the scaling of different observables,
including the many-body Chern number and other topological quantities, thus
establishing hierarchical mean-field theory as a method to study topological
quantum spin liquids.

<h3>Superconductivity in the pressurized nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ in the  vicinity of a BEC-BCS crossover</h3>

<p>Ever since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates,
gaining microscopic insights into the nature of pairing in strongly correlated,
repulsively interacting fermionic systems has remained one of the greatest
challenges in modern condensed matter physics. Following recent experiments
reporting superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO)
with remarkably high critical temperatures of $T_c = 80$ K, it has been argued
that the low-energy physics of LNO can be described by the strongly correlated
mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer $t-J$ model. Here we investigate this bilayer
system and utilize density matrix renormalization group techniques to establish
an intricate understanding of the model and the magnetically induced pairing
through comparison to the perturbative limit of dominating inter-layer spin
couplings. In particular, this allows us to explain appearing finite-size
effects, firmly establishing the existence of long-range pairing order in the
thermodynamic limit. As the effective model in the perturbative limit is known
to show linear resistivity above the superconducting transition temperature, we
propose a pair-based interpretation of the extended strange metal phase
observed in LNO. By analyzing binding energies, we predict a BEC-BCS crossover
as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters, whereas LNO is anticipated to lie
on the BCS side in vicinity of the transition. We find large binding energies
of the order of the inter-layer coupling that suggest strikingly high critical
temperatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, raising the
question whether nickelate superconductors possibly facilitate critical
temperatures above room temperature.

<h3>Topological Orders Having no Topological Quantum Field Theory  Description</h3>

<i>P. Vojta, G. Ortiz, Z. Nussinov</i>
<p>Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics
that have been very attractive to quantum computing schemes. It has long been
believed that the salient universal features of topologically ordered systems
are invariably described by topological quantum field theories. In the current
work, we illustrate that this is not necessarily so. Towards this end, we
construct and study a rich class of two- and three-dimensional topologically
ordered models featuring interacting anyons (both Abelian and non-Abelian). In
these theories, the lowest excitation energies depend on the relative
geometrical placement of the anyons leading to properties that cannot be
described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by
performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders.
Our approach enables a general method for mapping general Landau type theories
to topologically ordered dual models. The low-energy subspaces of our models
are more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.

Active solids emerge from self-actuating components interacting with each
other to form crystalline patterns. In equilibrium, commensurability underpins
our understanding of nanoscale friction and particle-level dynamics of
crystals. However, these concepts have yet to be imported into the realm of
active matter. Here, we develop an experimental platform and a theoretical
description for microscopic clusters composed of active particles confined and
self-assembled into small crystals. In our experiments, these crystallites form
upon circular confinement of active rollers, with a magic number of 61 rollers
per well. Competition between solidity and self propulsion leads to self
shearing and complex flow inversion behaviour, along with self sliding states
and activity induced melting. We discover active stick slip dynamics, which
periodically switch between a commensurate static state and an incommensurate
self-sliding state characterised by a train of localised defects. We describe
the steady state behaviour using a discretised model of active hydrodynamics.
We then quantify the intermittent stick slip dynamics using a self-propelled
extension of the Frenkel Kontorova (FK) model, a fundamental workhorse of
slipping and flow in crystals. Our findings in a colloidal model system point
to a wealth of phenomena in incommensurate active solids as design principles
for both assembly and robotics down to the nanoscale.

<h3>Motion of microswimmers in cylindrical microchannels</h3>

Biological and artificial microswimmers often have to propel through a
variety of environments, ranging from heterogeneous suspending media to strong
geometrical confinement. Under confinement, local flow fields generated by
microswimmers, and steric and hydrodynamic interactions with their environment
determine the locomotion. We propose a squirmer-like model to describe the
motion of microswimmers in cylindrical microchannels, where propulsion is
generated by a fixed surface slip velocity. The model is studied analytically
for cylindrical swimmer shapes, and by numerical hydrodynamics simulations for
spherical and spheroidal shapes. For the numerical simulations, we employ the
dissipative particle dynamics method for modelling fluid flow. Both the
analytical model and simulations show that the propulsion force increases with
increasing confinement. However, the swimming velocity under confinement
remains lower than the swimmer speed without confinement for all investigated
conditions. In simulations, different swimming modes (i.e. pusher, neutral,
puller) are investigated, and found to play a significant role in the
generation of propulsion force when a swimmer approaches a dead end of a
capillary. Propulsion generation in confined systems is local, such that the
generated flow field generally vanishes beyond the characteristic size of the
swimmer. These results contribute to a better understanding of microswimmer
force generation and propulsion under strong confinement, including the motion
in porous media and in narrow channels.

<h3>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04230" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04230</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states
over the phonon Debye contribution, is often identified as being a
characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its
microscopic origin still remains a mystery and a consensus on its theoretical
derivation has not yet been achieved. Recently, it has been proposed, and
corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized
modes which involve string-like excitations ("stringlets") having a
one-dimensional (1D) nature. In this work, we build on a theoretical framework
originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating
strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as
observed in independent simulation studies. We show that a generalization of
this framework provides an analytical prediction for the BP frequency
$\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the glass transition
temperature in both 2D and 3D amorphous systems. The final result involves no
free parameters and is in quantitative agreement with prior simulation
observations. Additionally, this stringlet theory of the BP naturally
reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an
analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear
modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of
glass-forming liquids, which are normally performed above the glass-transition
temperature, $T_g$. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence
of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large
low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in
both experiments and simulations.

<h3>Magnetic functionalization and Catalytic behavior of magnetic  nanoparticles during laser photochemical graphitization of polyimide</h3>

We report laser-assisted photochemical graphitization of polyimides (PI) into
functional magnetic nanocomposites using laser irradiation of PI in the
presence of magnetite nanoparticles (MNP). PI Kapton sheets covered with MNP
were photochemically treated under ambient conditions using a picosecond pulsed
laser (1064nm) to obtain an electrically conductive material. Scanning electron
microscopy of the treated material revealed layered magnetic
nanoparticles/graphite nanocomposite structure (MNP/graphite). Four probe
conductivity measurements indicated that nanocomposite has an electrical
conductivity of 1550 S/m. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer-based magnetic characterization of the treated material revealed
an anisotropic ferromagnetic response in the MNP/graphite nanocomposite
compared to the isotropic response of MNP. Raman spectroscopy of MNP/graphite
nanocomposite revealed a four-fold improvement in graphitization, suppression
in disorder, and decreased nitrogenous impurities compared to the graphitic
material obtained from laser treatment of just PI sheets. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were
used to delineate the phase transformations of MNP during the formation of
MNP/graphite nanocomposite. Post-mortem characterization indicates a possible
photocatalytic effect of MNP during MNP/graphite nanocomposite formation. Under
laser irradiation, MNP transformed from the initial Fe3O4 phase to
{\gamma}-Fe2O3 and Fe5C2 phases and acted as nucleation spots to catalyze the
graphitization process of PI.

<h3>Reentrant supersolidity</h3>

A "supersolid" -- a crystal that exhibits an off-diagonal long-range order
and a superflow -- has been a subject of much research since its first proposal
[Andreev and Lifshitz 1969], but has not been realized as a ground state of
short-range interacting bosons in a continuum. In this note I point out a
simple and generic mechanism for a thermally-driven reentrant supersolidity,
and discuss challenges of experimental realization of this idea. In the limit
of bosons in a periodic potential, this mechanism reduces to a {\em reentrant}
low-temperature normal-superfluid transition, that should be accessible to
simulations and in current experiments on bosonic atoms in an optical periodic
potential.

Motivated by recent experiments on Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ that reveal a dynamic,
liquid-like ground state, we study the nearest neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian of
dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets with the pseudofermion functional
renormalization group (PFFRG), which is numerically implemented by the
SpinParser software. Taking the interaction between the octupolar components to
be dominant and antiferromagnetic, we map out the phase diagram demarcating the
quantum disordered and magnetically ordered states. We identify four distinct
phases, namely the $0$-flux and $\pi$-flux quantum spin ices, and the
all-in-all-out magnetic orders along the local $z$ and $x$ axes. We further use
the static two-spin correlations output by the PFFRG algorithm to compute the
polarized neutron scattering cross-sections, which are able to capture several
qualitative features observed experimentally, in the materially relevant
parameter regime that stabilizes the $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice. Our results
provide support for a quantum spin liquid ground state in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.

Antiferromagnets offer much faster dynamics compared to their ferromagnetic
counterparts but their order parameter is extremely difficult to detect and
control. So far, controlling the N\'eel order parameter electrically is limited
to only very few materials where N\'eel spin-orbit torques are allowed by
symmetry. In this work, we show that coupling a thin ferromagnet (permalloy)
layer on top of an antiferromagnet (Mn$_2$Au) solves a major roadblock -- the
controlled reading, writing, and manipulation of antiferromagnetic domains. We
confirm by atomistic spin dynamics simulations that the domain wall patterns in
the Mn$_2$Au are imprinted on the permalloy, therefore allowing for indirect
imaging of the N\'eel order parameter. Our simulations show that the coupled
domain wall structures in Mn$_2$Au-Py bilayers can be manipulated by either
acting on the N\'eel order parameter via N\'eel spin-orbit torques or by acting
on the magnetisation (the ferromagnetic order parameter) via magnetic fields.
In both cases, we predict ultra-high domain wall speeds on the order of 8.5
km/s. Thus, employing a thin ferromagnetic layer has the potential to easily
control the N\'eel order parameter in antiferromagnets even where N\'eel
spin-orbit torques are forbidden by symmetry. The controlled manipulation of
the antiferromagnetic order parameter provides a promising basis for the
development of high-density storage and efficient computing technologies
working in the THz regime.

A layered rhombohedral polymorph of indium (III) triiodide is synthesized at
high pressure and temperature. The unit cell symmetry and approximate
dimensions are determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Its R-3 crystal
structure, with a = 7.217 {\AA}, and c = 20.476 {\AA}, is refined by the
Rietveld method on powder X-ray diffraction data. The crystal structure is
based on InI6 octahedra sharing edges to form honeycomb lattice layers, though
with considerable stacking variations. Different from ambient pressure InI3,
which has a monoclinic molecular structure and a light-yellow color, high
pressure InI3 is layered and has an orange color. The band gaps of both the
monoclinic and rhombohedral variants of InI3 are estimated from diffuse
reflectance measurements.

<h3>Hydrodynamics of Borromean Counterfluids</h3>

<br>
<i>Egor Babaev, Boris Svistunov</i>
<br>
<br>
Counterflow superfluidity in a system with $N\geq 3$ components is
distinctively different from the $N=2$ case. The key feature is the difference
between the number ($N$) of elementary vortex excitations and the number
($N-1$) of independent branches of phonon modes, that is, the number of
superfluid modes is larger than the number of ordered phase variables. We show
how all the dynamical and statistical aspects of this ("Borromean") type of
ordering are naturally described by effective $N$-component theory featuring
compact-gauge invariance.

<h3>Machine learning of a density functional for anisotropic patchy  particles</h3>

<br>
Anisotropic patchy particles have become an archetypical statistical model
system for associating fluids. Here we formulate an approach to the
Kern-Frenkel model via classical density functional theory to describe the
positionally and orientationally resolved equilibrium density distributions in
flat wall geometries. The density functional is split into a reference part for
the orientationally averaged density and an orientational part in mean-field
approximation. To bring the orientational part into a kernel form suitable for
machine learning techniques, an expansion into orientational invariants and the
proper incorporation of single-particle symmetries is formulated. The
mean-field kernel is constructed via machine learning on the basis of hard wall
simulation data. Results are compared to the well-known random-phase
approximation which strongly underestimates the orientational correlations
close to the wall. Successes and shortcomings of the mean-field treatment of
the orientational part are highlighted and perspectives are given for attaining
a full density functional via machine learning.

<br>
<br>
The catalytic sites of MoS$_{2}$ monolayers towards hydrogen evolution are
well known to be vacancies and edge-like defects. However, it is still very
challenging to control the position, size, and defective areas on the basal
plane of Mo$S_{2}$ monolayers by most of defect-engineering routes. In this
work, the fabrication of etched arrays on ultra-large supported and
free-standing MoS$_{2}$ monolayers using focused ion beam (FIB) is reported for
the first time. By tuning the Ga+ ion dose, it is possible to confine defects
near the etched edges or spread them over ultra-large areas on the basal plane.
The electrocatalytic activity of the arrays toward hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) was measured by fabricating microelectrodes using a new method that
preserves the catalytic sites. We demonstrate that the overpotential can be
decreased up to 290 mV by assessing electrochemical activity only at the basal
plane. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images obtained on FIB
patterned freestanding MoS$_{2}$ monolayers reveal the presence of amorphous
regions and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates sulfur excess in these
regions. Density-functional theory calculations provide identification of
catalytic defect sites. Our results demonstrate a new rational control of
amorphous-crystalline surface boundaries and future insight for defect
optimization in MoS$_{2}$ monolayers.

Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and
experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many
exotic physical properties, the very limited availability of known
altermagnetic materials~(e.g., 14 confirmed materials) hinders the study of
such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials is
crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus
facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies,
e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Here, we report 25 new
altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators,
discovered by an AI search engine unifying symmetry analysis, graph neural
network pre-training, optimal transport theory, and first-principles electronic
structure calculation. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics
reveals that various innovative physical properties manifest in these newly
discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr
effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 8 $i$-wave
altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine
performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic
materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated
discovery of altermagnetic materials.

<br>
<br>
To experimentally clarify the changes in structural and dynamic
heterogeneities in a metallic glass (MG), Gd65Co35, by rejuvenation with a
temperature cycling (cryogenic rejuvenation), high-energy x-ray diffraction
(HEXRD), anomalous x-ray scattering (AXS), and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS)
experiments were carried out. By a repeated temperature change between liquid
N2 and room temperatures 40 times, tiny but clear structural changes are
observed by HEXRD even in the first neighboring range. Partial structural
information obtained by AXS reveals that slight movements of the Gd and Co
atoms occur in the first- and second-neighboring shells around the central Gd
atom. The concentration inhomogeneity in the nm size drastically increases for
the Gd atoms by the temperature cycling, while the other heterogeneities are
negligible. A distinct change was detected in a microscopic elastic property by
IXS: The width of longitudinal acoustic excitation broadens by about 20%,
indicating an increase of the elastic heterogeneity of this MG by the thermal
treatments. These static and dynamic results explicitly clarify the features of
the cryogenic rejuvenation effect experimentally.

We developed a semiclassical approximation method in combination with an
adaptive moment estimation optimizer (SCA + ADAM) approach based on the PyTorch
plus CUDA library on a the graphics processing unit (GPU). This method was
employed to evaluate one-particle properties of the Hubbard model with
long-range spatial correlations within an appropriate computing duration. The
method was applied to the ionic Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square
lattice with long-range spatial correlations. The computation time was
evaluated as a function of the lattice size on the central processing unit and
GPU. Herein, we also discuss the density of states and antiferromagnetic (AF)
order parameter in the Hubbard model without the ionic potential and compare
the results with those of the Hartree-Fock approximation. Finally, we present
the one-particle properties and order parameter in charge density wave, AF
metal and AF insulator of the ionic Hubbard model.

<br>
<br>
We studied the effects of superconducting quantum correlations in a system
consisting of two quantum dots, two normal leads, and a superconductor. Using
the non-equilibrium Green's functions method, we analyzed the transmission,
density of states, and differential conductance of electrons between the normal
leads. We found that the superconducting correlations resulted in Fano-Andreev
interference, which is characterized by two anti-resonance line shapes in all
of these quantities. This behavior was observed in both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium regimes and persisted even when Coulomb correlations were taken
into account using the Hubbard-I approximation. It is worth noting that the
robustness of this behavior against these conditions has not been studied
previously in the literature.

Plasmon is a collective excitation in metals formed through the Coulomb
interaction between individual excitations of electron-hole pairs. In many
previous studies on the plasmonic response, the role of the longitudinal field
has been focused almost exclusively on the light-induced plasmonic phenomena,
e.g., hot-carrier generation. In our previous study [Phys. Rev. B 105, 165408
(2022)], we have revealed the significant contribution of the transverse
electromagnetic field to connect plasmons and electron-hole pairs in
nanostructures based on the self-consistent and nonlocal response theory. In
this study, we examine how this contribution appears depending on the system
parameters, e.g., length and refractive index. The elucidation of roles of
coherent coupling between the collective and individual excitations by the
transverse field will lead to the principle of controlling bidirectional energy
transfer between the plasmons and electron-hole pairs, which could
significantly enhance hot-carrier generation efficiency.

Hydrogen may be incorporated into nominally anhydrous minerals including
bridgmanite and post-perovskite as defects, making the Earth's deep mantle a
potentially significant water reservoir. The diffusion of hydrogen and its
contribution to the electrical conductivity in the lower mantle are rarely
explored and remain largely unconstrained. Here we calculate hydrogen
diffusivity in hydrous bridgmanite and post-perovskite, using molecular
dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials of ab initio
quality. Our findings reveal that hydrogen diffusivity significantly increases
with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure, and is considerably
sensitive to hydrogen incorporation mechanism. Among the four defect mechanisms
examined, (Mg + 2H)$_{\rm Si}$ and (Al + H)$_{\rm Si}$ show similar patterns
and yield the highest hydrogen diffusivity. Hydrogen diffusion is generally
faster in post-perovskite than in bridgmanite, and these two phases exhibit
distinct diffusion anisotropies. Overall, hydrogen diffusion is slow on
geological time scales and may result in heterogeneous water distribution in
the lower mantle. Additionally, the proton conductivity of bridgmanite for (Mg
+ 2H)$_{\rm Si}$ and (Al + H)$_{\rm Si}$ defects aligns with the same order of
magnitude of lower mantle conductivity, suggesting that the water distribution
in the lower mantle may be inferred by examining the heterogeneity of
electrical conductivity.

<h3>Kekulé valence bond order in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb  lattice with possible lattice distortions for graphene</h3>

We investigate if and how the valence-bond-solid (VBS) state emerges in the
Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice when the Peierls-type electron-lattice
coupling is introduced. We consider all possible lattice-distortion patterns
allowed for this lattice model for graphene which preserve the reflection
symmetry and determine the most stable configuration in the adiabatic limit by
using an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo method. The VBS phase with Kekul\'e
dimerization is found to appear as an intermediate phase between a semimetal
and an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator for a moderately rigid lattice. This
implies that the undistorted semimetallic graphene can be driven into the VBS
phase by applying strain, accompanied by the single-particle excitation gap
opening.

<br>
Orientation, structure and morphology in the early growth stages of CuO films
on strontium titanate were studied by synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction.
Nanostructured CuO films were obtained by ex situ heat treatment at 970 K in
oxygen flow at ambient pressure after an initial deposition of Cu on
SrTiO$_3$(001) at $10^{-4}$ Pa oxygen pressure using the molecular beam epitaxy
technique. These films at low coverages grow forming islands a few tens of
nanometers wide, with the [010] direction perpendicular to the substrate
surface. Two types of epitaxies are observed, CuO[001]//SrTiO$_3$[100] and
CuO[100]//SrTiO$_3$[100], the former being the preferred one. The combination
of these epitaxies with the P4mm surface symmetry of the substrate generates 16
different orientations of nanostructures. The lattice constant values obtained
from X-ray diffraction are very close to those of bulk tenorite, with the
exception of the monoclinic angle $\theta$, which is reduced from 99.54$^\circ$
to 96.76(8)$^\circ$ by the epitaxy constraints. This angle is a key parameter
in determining the magnetic properties of CuO.

<h3>Minimal Surfaces & the Intermediate State of Type-I Superconductors</h3>

<br>
<br>
The geometry of the intermediate state (IS) flux structures of type-I
superconductors, observed during early stages of magnetic flux penetration
induced by an externally applied perpendicular magnetic field, is approached in
terms of minimal surfaces. This approach follows from the assumption that a
local free energy minimization constraint, for each individual flux structure,
dominates for sufficiently spatially separated magnetic flux regions, i.e. when
over global free energy minimization predicts very low periodicity of sample
intermediate state.

<br>
<br>
In the field of symmetry-protected topological phases, a common wisdom is
that the symmetries fix the topological classifications, but they alone cannot
determine whether a system is topologically trivial or not. Here, we show that
this is no longer true in cases where symmetries are projectively represented.
Particularly, the Zak phase, a topological invariant of a one-dimensional
system, can be entirely determined by the projective symmetry algebra (PSA). To
demonstrate this remarkable effect, we propose a minimal model, termed as flux
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, where the bond dimerization in the original
SSH model is replaced by a flux dimerization. We present experimental
realization of our flux SSH model in an electric-circuit array, and our
predictions are directly confirmed by experimental measurement. Our work
refreshes the understanding of the relation between symmetry and topology,
opens up new avenues for exploring PSA determined topological phases, and
suggests flux dimerization as a novel approach for designing topological
crystals.

<h3>Active search for a reactive target in thermal environments</h3>

<br>
<i>Byeong Guk Go, Euijin Jeon, Yong Woon Kim</i>
<br>
<br>
We study a stochastic process where an active particle, modeled by a
one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle, searches for a target with a finite
absorption strength in thermal environments. Solving the Fokker-Planck equation
for a uniform initial distribution, we analytically calculate the mean
searching time (MST), the time for the active particle to be finally absorbed,
and show that there exists an optimal self-propulsion velocity of the active
particle at which MST is minimized. As the diffusion constant increases, the
optimal velocity changes from a finite value to zero, which implies that a
purely diffusive Brownian motion outperforms an active motion in terms of
searching time. Depending on the absorption strength of the target, the
transition of the optimal velocity becomes either continuous or discontinuous,
which can be understood based on the Landau approach. In addition, we obtain
the phase diagram indicating the passive-efficient and the active-efficient
regions. Finally, the initial condition dependence of MST is presented in
limiting cases.

<br>
<br>
The scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence (STML) can be used to
probe the optical and electronic properties of molecules. Concerning the
vibronic coupling, we model the molecule as a two-level system with the
vibrational degrees of freedom. Based on the Bardeen's theory, we express the
inelastic tunneling current in terms of Huang-Rhys factor within the inelastic
electron scattering (IES) mechanism. We find that the differential conductance,
varying with the bias voltage, exhibits distinct step structure with various
vibronic coupling strength. The second derivative of the inelastic tunneling
current with respect to the bias voltage shows the characteristics of
vibrational-level structure with Franck-Condon factor. Consequently, we propose
a method to determine the Huang-Rhys factor of molecules, holding promising
potential within the realm of solid-state physics.

The Ising model, often seen as the paradigmatic spin model, has been heavily
studied for its mathematical description of ferromagnetism in statistical
mechanics. We explore a quantum version of this model, the transverse field
Ising model, and investigate how the quantum property of magnetization
fluctuates with geometrical frustration, a phenomenon arising from the geometry
of a spin system's ground state. We introduce a general measure for frustration
and then implement a computational model built in Python that translates spin
lattices into adjacency matrices, solves the spectrum of the transverse field
Ising model, calculates the expected magnetization of the ground state, plots
the variable over randomly generated spin systems with controllable degrees of
geometrical frustration, and compares the evolution of these plots over an
increasing transverse field. Our finite-size studies exhibit an expected
decrease in magnetization with increasing frustration and suggest the
possibility of robust phases in the large N limit over finite ranges of
frustration, which may be precursors to spin liquids or spin glasses.

<br>
<i>Disha Arora, Deepanshu Aggarwal, Sankalpa Ghosh, Rohit Narula</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate one- and two-photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene
(TBLG) by examining the effects of tuning the twist angle $ \theta $ and the
excitation energy $ E_l $ on their corresponding absorption coefficients $
\alpha_{i=1,2}$. We find that $ \alpha_1 $ shows distinct peaks as a function
of $ E_l $ which correspond to the van Hove singularities (vHS) of TBLG. In
contrast to single- (SLG) and AB bilayer graphene (BLG), $ \alpha_1 $ is
substantially enhanced by $\sim 2$ and $\sim 1$ orders of magnitude,
respectively, in the visible range. On the other hand, $\alpha_2 $ exhibits a
remarkable increase of $\sim 11$ and $\sim 9$ orders of magnitude.
Interestingly, as $\theta$ increases, the resonant features exhibited by
$\alpha_{i=1,2}$ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ shift progressively from the infrared to
the visible. On doping TBLG, both $\alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $ remain
essentially unchanged \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ but with a minor red-shift in their
resonant peaks. Additionally, we explore various polarization configurations
for TPA and determine the conditions under which $\alpha_2$ becomes extremal.

<h3>Polymorphism of two-dimensional antiferromagnets, AgF2 and CuF2</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Jezierski, Wojciech Grochala</i>
<br>
<br>
We present theoretical study of relative stability as well as of the magnetic
and electronic properties of AgF2 and CuF2, in two related structural forms:
orthorhombic (ambient pressure form of AgF2) and monoclinic (ambient pressure
form of CuF2), using Density Functional Theory. We show, that at P21/c --> Pbca
structural transition is associated with weakening of intra-sheet magnetic
superexchange. This finding is consistent with the flattening of 2D layers,
smaller charge-transfer energy and stronger admixing of Agd/Cud-Fp states in
monoclinic structure, comparing to orthorhombic form. Consequently, monoclinic
AgF2 should be targeted in experiment as it should show stronger magnetic
coupling than its orthorhombic sibling. The dynamically stable P21/c form of
AgF2 could be achieved via two alternative paths: by applied negative strain,
or by rapid quenching silver(II) difluoride from temperatures higher than 480 K
to low temperatures.

<br>
The anomalous $\lambda$-transition of liquid sulfur, which is supposed to be
related to the transformation of eight-membered sulfur rings into long
polymeric chains, has attracted considerable attention. However, a detailed
description of the underlying dynamical polymerization process is still
missing. Here, we study the structures and the mechanism of the polymerization
processes of liquid sulfur across the $\lambda$-transition as well as its
reverse process of formation of the rings. We do so by performing
ab-initio-quality molecular dynamics simulations thanks to a combination of
machine learning potentials and state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques.
With our approach, we obtain structural results that are in good agreement with
the experiments and we report precious dynamical insights into the mechanisms
involved in the process.

<h3>Stochastic model for transfer of gaseous particles in polymer/CNT  nanocomposites with interfacial regions</h3>

<br>
<i>Polina Kalashnikova, Ilia Kalashnikov, Konstantin Khromov</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work a stochastic model of gaseous transfer in polymer/CNT
nanocomposites is presented. The model takes into account interfacial areas,
i.e. polymer depletion regions. The local regime of transport is controlled by
the density of the polymer. In a dense polymer, this regime corresponds to the
ordinary diffusion, while in free volume regions it corresponds to the
ballistic transport. The introduction of a free volume and/or a depleted
polymer layer near to a CNT wall, leads to the emergence of anomalous
diffusion. We have demonstrated how the anomalous diffusion regime changes in
the presence of nanotubes for different distributions of polymer density. The
presented approach allows us to describe the threshold effect in the diffusion
coefficient as a function of CNTs density in polymer/CNT nanocomposites.

In this article we outline the historical development and key results

parafermions provides a natural N-state generalization of free fermions, which
have long underpinned the exact solution and application of widely studied

the Baxter-Fendley free parafermionic Z(N) spin chain, which is a relatively
simple non-Hermitian generalization of the Ising model.

<i>Raúl Bombín, Viktor Cikojević, Ferran Mazzanti, Jordi Boronat</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a quantum Monte Carlo based density functional to describe droplet
formation and supersolidity in dipolar systems. The usual Lee-Huang-Yang term,
accounting for quantum correlations in the conventional extended
Gross-Pitaievskii equation (eGPE), has been substituted by the correlation
energy evaluated with Quantum Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the ability of the
new functional to reproduce existing experimental data for the minimum critical
number of atoms $N_\mathrm{c}$ required for droplet formation. $N_\mathrm{c}$
is a challenging quantity for theoretical predictions, and the eGPE provides
only a qualitative description of it, mainly when it is applied to Dysprosium.
We also use the new approach to characterize the BEC-supersolid transition. The
quantum Monte Carlo based functional can be easily implemented in any existing
eGPE code, improving the description of dipolar systems without increasing the
computational cost.

<br>
<br>
We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Harper model, considering both the
short- and long-range p-wave pairing. Here, the non-Hermiticity is considered
at the onsite potential. A comprehensive analysis of several critical aspects
of this system, including the eigenspectra, localization properties, PT}
symmetry, real to complex transition, and topological properties, is conducted.
Specifically, we observe the emergence of Majorana zero modes in the case of
short-range pairing, whereas the massive Dirac modes emerge in the case of
long-range pairing. Notably, a triple-phase transition is identified, involving
simultaneous transitions from extended or metallic state to critical
multifractal state, unbroken to broken PT symmetry, and unconventional real to
complex energies. In addition, a double-phase transition is observed, where the
topological and superconducting transitions occur concurrently. These
intriguing double- and triple-phase transitions are observed in both short- and
long-range pairing cases.

<br>

We investigate, both numerically and analytically, the time evolution of a
particle in an initial plane wave state as it is subject to elastic scattering
in a two-dimensional disordered system with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the
analytic calculation, we treat the SOC non-perturbatively, and the disorder
perturbatively using the Diffuson and the Cooperon. We identify weak and strong
SOC regimes, and give the relevant time and energy scales in each case. We
calculate the time dependence of coherent backscattering (CBS) as a function of
the strength of the SOC. By studying the time dependence of the anisotropy of
the disorder-averaged momentum distribution we identify the spin relaxation
time. We find a crossover from D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation for weak SOC to
Elliot-Yafet like behaviour for strong SOC.

<br>
<br>
The putative spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 exhibits multiple
superconducting phases under applied pressure [D. Braithwaite et al., Commun.
Phys. 2, 1 (2019)]. The clarification of pairing mechanisms and symmetries of
gap functions are essentially important for understanding the multiple-phase
diagram. Since the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations with Ising-like anisotropy is suggested from measurements of
magnetic susceptibilities and neutron scattering measurements, it is expected
that the interplay between these spin fluctuations plays a crucial role in the
emergence of the multiple superconducting phases. Motivated by these
observations, we examine the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism,
analyzing the linearized Eliashberg equations for an effective model of
f-electron bands. It is found that the Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations
stabilize spin-triplet pairings in either the Au or B3u states, whereas
Ising-like antiferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in
the B1u state. These results provide a plausible scenario elucidating the
multiple superconducting phases under pressure.

We investigate the feasibility of epitaxial growth of a three-dimensional

first time on molecular beam epitaxy growth of cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum
wells on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The presence of the quantum wells is
confirmed by photoluminescence measurements conducted at helium temperatures.
Growth of quantum wells on two dimensional, almost perfectly flat hBN appears
to be very different from growth on bulk substrates, in particular it requires
70-100$^\circ$C lower temperatures.

<br>

Recent works have established a novel viewpoint that treats the eigenvalue
spectra of disordered quantum systems as time-series, and corresponding
algorithms such as singular-value-decomposition has proven its advantage in
studying subtle physical quantities like Thouless energy and non-ergodic
extended regime. On the other hand, algorithms from complex networks have long
been known as a powerful tool to study highly nonlinear time-series. In this
work, we combine these two ideas together. Using the particular algorithm
called visibility graph (VG) that transforms the eigenvalue spectra of a random
spin system into complex networks, it's shown the degree distribution of the
resulting network is capable of signaturing the eigenvalue evolution during the
thermal to many-body localization transition, and the networks in the thermal
phase have a small-world structure. We further show these results are robust
even when the eigenvalues are incomplete with missing levels, which reveals the
advantage of the VG algorithm.

<br>

We used density-functional-theory simulations to examine the structural and
electronic properties of the $\Sigma 180{\deg}(100)[001] $ grain boundary in
monoclinic ZrO$_2$, which is a very low-energy (0.06Jm$^{-2}$) twin boundary
present in experimental oxide texture maps, with suggested special properties.
This equilibrium structure was compared with a metastable structure (with a
boundary energy of 0.32Jm$^{-2}$), which was considered to be representative of
a more general oxide boundary. The interaction of oxygen vacancies,
substitutional Sn and Nb defects (substituting host Zr sites) with both
structures - and their effect on the boundary properties - were examined. We
found that the equilibrium structure energetically favours V$_\textrm{O}^{2+}$
and Nb$_\textrm{Zr}^{2-}$, whereas the metastable structure favours
V$_\textrm{O}^{2+}$ and Sn$_\textrm{Zr}^{2-}$. Tin was further found to bind
strongly with oxygen vacancies in both structures, and introduce gap states in
the band gap of their electronic structure. Sn$_\textrm{Zr}^{2-}$ was, however,
found to increase the segregation preference of V$_\textrm{O}^{2+}$ for the
metastable structure, which might contribute to increased oxygen and electron
transport down this interface, and therefore other more general boundaries,
compared to the equilibrium structure of the studied monoclinic twin boundary.

<h3>Noise-Induced Collective Actuation in Active Solids</h3>

<br>
<br>
Collective actuation describes the spontaneous synchronized oscillations
taking place in active solids, when the elasto-active feedback, that
generically couples the reorientation of the active forces and the elastic
stress, is large enough. In the absence of noise, collective actuation takes
the form of a strong condensation of the dynamics on a specific pair of modes
and their generalized harmonics. Here we report new experiments conducted with
centimetric active elastic structures, where collective oscillation takes place
along the single lowest energy mode of the system, gapped from the other modes
because of the system's geometry. Combining the numerical and theoretical
analysis of an agent-based model, we demonstrate that this new form of
collective actuation is noise-induced. The effect of the noise is first
analyzed in a single-particle toy model that reveals the interplay between the
noise and the specific structure of the phase space. We then show that in the
continuous limit, any finite amount of noise turns this new form of transition
to collective actuation into a bona fide supercritical Hopf bifurcation.

Understanding the topological aspects of the band structure of solids has
fundamentally changed our appreciation of their properties. The layered, van
der Waals transition-metal pentatelluride ZrTe$_5$ has proven on numerous
occasions to be an excellent candidate for the study of controllable
topological phase transitions. Here, we investigate the topological phase
diagrams of monolayer and bilayer forms of ZrTe$_5$, under mechanical
deformations using \textit{ab initio} techniques. We find that mechanical
deformation can close the monolayer's topological gap, while the bilayer
exhibits richer phase diagram, including both topological insulating, trivial
metallic and insulating phases. The bilayer is predicted to be on the
topological phase boundary. We also address the preparation of monolayers,
using \emph{ab initio} simulations and experimental scanning tunneling
microscopy measurements. We confirm that while monolayer ZrTe$_5$ is difficult
to exfoliate without compromising its crystalline structure, bilayers offer a
more stable alternative, revealing the complexities and limitations of using
gold substrates for monolayer exfoliation.

Numerous formulation processes of materials involve a drying step, during
which evaporation of a solvent from a multi-component liquid mixture, often
confined in a thin film or in a droplet, lead to concentration and assembly of
non volatile compounds. While the basic phenomena ruling evaporation dynamics
are known, a precise modeling of practical situations is hindered by the lack
of tools for local and time-resolved mapping of concentration fields in such
confined systems. In this article, the use of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
Microscopy and of Fluorescent Molecular Rotors is introduced as a versatile,
in-situ and quantitative method to map viscosity and concentration fields in
confined, evaporating liquids. More precisely, the cases of drying of a
suspended liquid film and of a sessile droplet of mixtures of fructose and
water is investigated. Measured viscosity and concentration fields allow to
characterize drying dynamics, in agreement with simple modeling of the
evaporation process.

Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) trained against quantum-mechanical
reference data have demonstrated remarkable accuracy, surpassing empirical
potentials. However, the absence of readily available general-purpose MLPs
encompassing a broad spectrum of elements and their alloys hampers the
applications of MLPs in materials science. In this study, we present a feasible
approach for constructing a unified general-purpose MLP for numerous elements
and showcase its capability by developing a model (UNEP-v1) for 16 elemental
metals (Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Ta, Ti, V, W, Zr) and their
diverse alloys. To achieve a complete representation of the chemical space, we
demonstrate that employing 16 one-component and 120 two-component systems
suffices, thereby avoiding the enumeration of all 65 535 possible combinations
for training data generation. Furthermore, we illustrate that systems with more
components can be adequately represented as interpolation points in the
descriptor space. Our unified MLP exhibits superior performance across various
physical properties as compared to the embedded-atom method potential, while
maintaining computational efficiency. It achieves a remarkable computational
speed of $1.5 \times 10^8$ atom step / second in molecular dynamics simulations
using eight 80-gigabyte A100 graphics cards, enabling simulations up to 100
million atoms. We demonstrate the generality and high efficiency of the MLP in
studying plasticity and primary radiation damage in the MoTaVW refractory
high-entropy alloys, showcasing its potential in unraveling complex materials
behavior. This work represents a significant leap towards the construction of a

Recently, a new category of superfluids and superconductors has been
discovered in various systems. These could be linked to the idea of a
supersolid phase, featuring a macroscopic wavefunction with spatial modulation
resulting from simultaneous, spontaneous breaking of gauge and translational
symmetries. However, this relation has only been recognized in some cases and
there is the need for universal properties quantifying the differences between
supersolids and ordinary superfluids/superconductors or crystals. A key
property is the superfluid fraction, which measures the reduction in superfluid
stiffness due to spatial modulation, leading to the non-standard superfluid
dynamics of supersolids. Here we employ the Josephson effect, common in
superfluids and superconductors, to measure the superfluid fraction in a
supersolid. Even without a physical barrier, the Josephson effect arises
spontaneously in a supersolid due to spatial modulation. Individual lattice
cells act as self-induced Josephson junctions, allowing the direct
determination of the local superfluid fraction. We studied a cold-atom dipolar
supersolid, revealing a significant sub-unity superfluid fraction. Our results
open new research directions, enabling the exploration of novel phenomena like
partially quantized vortices and supercurrents, potentially unifying the
understanding of supersolid-like systems, and introducing a new type of
Josephson junction.

In electrochemistry, reactions and charge-transfer are to a large extent
determined by the atomistic structure of the solid-liquid interface. Yet due to
the presence of the liquid electrolyte, many surface-science methods cannot be
applied here. Hence, the exact microscopic structure that is present under
operating conditions often remains unknown. Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy
(RAS) is one of the few techniques that allow for an in operando investigation
of the structure of solid-liquid interfaces. However, an interpretation of RAS
data on the atomistic scale can only be obtained by comparison to computational
spectroscopy. While the number of computational RAS studies related to
electrochemical systems is currently still limited, those studies so far have
not taken into account the dynamic nature of the solid-liquid interface. In
this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of the spectroscopic response
of the Au(110) missing row reconstruction in contact with water by combining ab
initio molecular dynamics with computational spectroscopy. Our results show
significant changes in the time evolution of the RA spectra, in particular
providing an explanation for the typically observed differences in intensity
when comparing theory and experiment. Moreover, these findings point to the
importance of structural surface/interface variability while at the same time
emphasising the potential of RAS for probing these dynamic interfaces.

We develop a theory of the magnetostriction for metals with small
charge-carrier pockets of their Fermi surfaces. As an example, we consider LuAs
that has a cubic crystal structure. The theory quite well describes the known
experimental data on the magnetostriction of this metal. The obtained results
also clearly demonstrate that the dilatometry can be used for detecting tiny
Fermi-surface pockets that are not discerned by traditional methods based on
investigations of the Shubnikov--de Haas and de Haas--van Alphen effects.

We comment on a work by T. Liverpool (Phys. Rev. E 101 (2020)). We show that
a theorem stated in that work is not correct. While this is inconsequential to
the bulk of the work (and holds asymptotically as we show), it is instructive
to highlight the importance of phase space compression in active systems with
generalized dynamics.

<h3>Real-space multifold degeneracy in graphene irradiated by twisted light</h3>

We report the theoretical discovery of real-space multifold degenerate
Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer graphene coherently driven by twisted
circulalry-polarized light. Using Floquet theory, we characterize the
real-space structure of quasienergies and Floquet modes in terms of the orbital
angular momentum and radial vortex profile of light. We obtain the effective
real-space Floquet Hamiltonian and show it supports crossings of Floquet modes,
especially at high-symmetry $K$ and $\Gamma$ points of graphene, at specific
radial positions from the vortex center. At specific frequencies, the vortex
bound states form a multifold degenerate structure in real-space. This
structure is purely dynamically generated and controlled by the frequency and
intensity of twisted light. We discuss the experimental feasibility of
observing and employing the real-space multifold degeneracy for coherent
optoelectronic quantum state engineering.

<h3>Coherent control of magnetization precession by double-pulse activation  of effective fields from magnetoacoustics and demagnetization</h3>

We demonstrate the coherent optical control of magnetization precession in a
thin Ni film by a second excitation pulse which amplifies or attenuates the
precession induced by a first pulse depending on the fluences of the
pump-pulses and the pump-pump delay. This control goes beyond the conventional
strategy, where the same mechanism drives the precession in or out-of phase. We
balance the magneto-acoustic mechanism driven by quasi-static strain and the
shape-anisotropy change triggered by laser-induced demagnetization. These
mechanisms tilt the transient effective magnetic field in opposite directions
in case of negative magneto-elastic coupling ($b_1<0$). While the strain
response is linear in the fluence, demagnetization is nonlinear near the Curie
temperature, enabling fluence-based control scenarios.

Corundum oxide Ti$_2$O$_3$ shows the metal-insulator transition around
400-600 K accompanying the nearest Ti$^{3+}$-Ti$^{3+}$ bond ($a_{1g}a_{1g}$
singlet state) formation along the $c$ axis. In order to clarify the
hole-doping effect for the $a_{1g}a_{1g}$ singlet bond in Ti$_2$O$_3$, we
investigated Ti $3d$ orbital anisotropy between corundum-type Ti$_2$O$_3$ and
ilmenite-type MgTiO$_3$ using linear dichroism of soft x-ray absorption
spectroscopy of the Ti $L_{2,3}$ edge. From the linear dichroic spectral weight
in Mg$_y$Ti$_{2-y}$O$_3$, we confirmed that the $a_{1g}a_{1g}$ state is
dominant not only in $y=0.01$ (almost Ti$_2$O$_3$), but also in $y = 0.29$,
indicating that the Ti-Ti bond survives against a certain level of hole doping.
In $y=0.63$ corresponding to 46% hole doping per Ti, the $3d$ orbital symmetry
changes from $a_{1g}$ to $e_g^{\pi}$.

In classical fluids, the Weber number is a dimensionless parameter that
characterises the flow of a multi-phase fluid. The superfluid analogy of a
classical multi-phase fluid can be realised in a system of two or more
immiscible Bose-Einstein condensates. These superfluid mixtures have been shown
to display a wider variety of exotic dynamics than their single component
counterparts. Here we systematically study the dynamics of a binary immiscible
Bose-Einstein Condensate in two dimensions, where a small bubble of the second
component is used to "stir" the first component. We begin by rigorously mapping
out the critical velocity for vortex shedding as a function of the size of the
bubble, in analogy to the critical velocity of a laser spoon. Observing that
the dynamics of the system depend on the initial size and velocity of the
bubble, we then show that a dimensionless parameter with the same form as the
Weber number accurately predicts the resulting bubble fragmentation.

<h3>Phosphorescence by trapping defects in boric acid induced by thermal  processing</h3>

The phosphorescence of boric acid at room temperature is a puzzling
phenomenon subject to controversial interpretations although the role of
structural defects has not yet been considered. Heat treatments of boric acid
cause its transformation into the metaboric phase and amorphous boron oxide.
The structural changes after thermal processing can create defects that become
centers of luminescence and recombination channels in the visible range. In the
present work, we have thermally processed commercial boric acid at different
temperatures. Samples treated between 200 and 400{\deg}C exhibit remarkable
phosphorescence in the visible range. At around 480 and 528 nm, two distinct
phosphorescent emissions occur, associated with trapped charge carriers
recombinations identified by thermoluminescence and electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy. Our structural and optical studies suggest that the
activation of boric acid phosphorescence after heat treatment is correlated
with the presence of defects. The afterglow results from a trapping and
detrapping process, which delays the recombination at the active optical
centers. Time-dependent density functional study of defective BOH molecules and
clusters shows the emergence of near UV and blue optical transitions in
absorption. These defects trigger the photoluminescence in thermally processed
boric acid samples.

<h3>Domain coarsening in polycrystalline graphene</h3>

Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon material which exhibits exceptional
properties, making it highly suitable for a wide range of applications.
Practical graphene fabrication often yields a polycrystalline structure with
many inherent defects, which significantly influence its performance. In this
study, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach based on the optimized Wooten, Winer
and Weaire (WWW) algorithm to simulate the crystalline domain coarsening
process of polycrystalline graphene. Our sample configurations show excellent
agreement with experimental data. We conduct statistical analyses of the bond
and angle distribution, temporal evolution of the defect distribution, and
spatial correlation of the lattice orientation that follows a stretched
exponential distribution. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the diffusion
behavior of defects and find that the changes in domain size follow a power-law
distribution. We briefly discuss the possible connections of these results to
(and differences from) domain growth processes in other statistical models,
such as the Ising dynamics. We also examine the impact of buckling of
polycrystalline graphene on the crystallization rate under substrate effects.
Our findings may offer valuable guidance and insights for both theoretical
investigations and experimental advancements.

<h3>d-Wave Hall effect and linear magnetoconductivity in metallic collinear  antiferromagnets</h3>

In this paper we theoretically predict a distinct class of anomalous Hall
effects occurring in metallic collinear antiferromagnets. The effect is
quadratic and $d-$wave symmetric in external magnetic field. In addition, the
electric current, transverse to the current voltage drop and the magnetic field
in the predicted effect are all in the same plane. Studied theoretical model
consists of two-dimensional fermions interacting with the Neel order through
momentum dependent exchange interaction having a $d-$wave symmetry. We also
find unusual linear magnetoconductivity in this model.

<h3>Floquet engineering of binding in doped and photo-doped Mott insulators</h3>

We investigate the emergence of bound states in chemically and photo-doped
Mott insulators, assisted by spin and $\eta$-pairing fluctuations within both
2-leg ladder and 2D systems. We demonstrate that the binding energies and
localization length in the chemically and photo-doped regimes are comparable.
To effectively describe the photo and chemically doped state on the same
footings, we employ the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, resulting in a
generalized $t$-$J$ model. Furthermore, we show that manipulating the binding
is possible through external periodic driving, a technique known as Floquet
engineering, leading to significantly enhanced binding energies. We also
roughly estimate the lifetime of photo-doped states under periodic driving
conditions based on the Fermi golden rule. Lastly, we propose experimental
protocols for realizing Hubbard excitons in cold-atom experiments.
