</p><i>Mohammadhossein Firouznia, David Saintillan</i>
<p>We study emergent dynamics in a viscous drop subject to interfacial nematic
activity. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we show how the interplay of
nematodynamics, activity-driven flows and surface deformations gives rise to a
sequence of self-organized behaviors of increasing complexity, from periodic
braiding motions of topological defects to chaotic defect dynamics and active
turbulence, along with spontaneous shape changes and translation. Our findings
recapitulate qualitative features of experiments and shed light on the
mechanisms underpinning morphological dynamics in active interfaces.

<h3>Eight-color chiral spin liquid in the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic model  with Kitaev interactions</h3>

<p>Multipolar spin systems provide a rich ground for the emergence of unexpected
states of matter due to their enlarged spin degree of freedom. In this study,
with a specific emphasis on $S=1$ magnets, we explore the interplay between
spin nematic states and spin liquids. Based on the foundations laid in the
prior work [R. Pohle et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, L140403 (2023)], we investigate
the $S=1$ Kitaev model with bilinear-biquadratic interactions, which
stabilizes, next to Kitaev spin liquid, spin nematic and triple-$q$ phases,
also an exotic chiral spin liquid. Through a systematic reduction of the spin
degree of freedom -- from $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ to $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ and ultimately
to a discrete eight-color model -- we provide an intuitive understanding of the
nature and origin of this chiral spin liquid. We find that the chiral spin
liquid is characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy, bound by a
residual entropy, extremely short-ranged correlations, a nonzero scalar spin
chirality marked by $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux order, and a gapped continuum of
excitations. Our work contributes not only to the specific exploration of $S=1$
Kitaev magnets but also to the broader understanding of the importance of
multipolar spin degree of freedom on the ground state and excitation properties
in quantum magnets.

<h3>Bis(stearoyl) Sulfide: A Stable, Odor-free Sulfur Precursor for  High-Efficiency Metal Sulfide Quantum Dot Photovoltaics</h3>

<p>The synthesis of metal sulfide nanocrystals is a crucial step in the
fabrication of quantum dot (QD) photovoltaics. Control over the quantum dot
size during synthesis allows for precise tuning of their optical and electronic
properties, making them an appealing choice for electronic applications. This
flexibility has led to the implementation of quantum dots in both
highly-efficient single junction solar cells and other optoelectronic devices
including photodetectors and transistors. Most commonly, metal sulfide quantum
dots are synthesized using the hot-injection method utilizing toxic, and air-
and moisture sensitive sulfur source: bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide (TMS)2S.
Here, we present bis(stearoyl) sulfide (St2S) as a new type of air-stable
sulfur precursor for the synthesis of sulfide-based QDs, which yields uniform,
pure, and stable nanocrystals. Photovoltaic devices based on these QDs are
equally efficient as those fabricated by (TMS)2S but exhibit an enhanced
operational stability. These results highlight that St2S can be widely adopted
for the synthesis of metal sulfide quantum dots for a range of optoelectronic
applications.

<h3>Remarkable performance recovery in highly defective perovskite solar  cells by photo-oxidation</h3>

<p>Exposure to environmental factors is generally expected to cause degradation
in perovskite films and solar cells. Herein, we show that films with certain
defect profiles can display the opposite effect, healing upon exposure to
oxygen under illumination. We tune the iodine content of methylammonium lead
triiodide perovskite from understoichiometric to overstoichiometric and expose
them to oxygen and light prior to the addition of the top layers of the device,
thereby examining the defect dependence of their photooxidative response in the
absence of storage-related chemical processes. The contrast between the
photovoltaic properties of the cells with different defects is stark.
Understoichiometric samples indeed degrade, demonstrating performance at 33% of
their untreated counterparts, while stoichiometric samples maintain their
performance levels. Surprisingly, overstoichiometric samples, which show low
current density and strong reverse hysteresis when untreated, heal to maximum
performance levels (the same as untreated, stoichiometric samples) upon the
photooxidative treatment. A similar, albeit smaller-scale, effect is observed
for triple cation and methylammonium-free compositions, demonstrating the
general application of this treatment to state-of-the-art compositions. We
examine the reasons behind this response by a suite of characterization
techniques, finding that the performance changes coincide with microstructural
decay at the crystal surface, reorientation of the bulk crystal structure for
the understoichiometric cells, and a decrease in the iodine-to-lead ratio of
all films. These results indicate that defect engineering is a powerful tool to
manipulate the stability of perovskite solar cells.

<h3>Towards low-temperature processing of efficient $γ$-CsPbI$_3$  perovskite solar cells</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11636" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11636</a>

</p><i>Zongbao Zhang, Ran Ji, Yvonne J. Hofstetter, Marielle Deconinck, Julius Brunner, Yanxiu Li, Qingzhi An, Yana Vaynzof</i>
<p>Inorganic cesium lead iodide (CsPbI$_3$) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have
attracted enormous attention due to their excellent thermal stability and
optical bandgap (~1.73 eV), well-suited for tandem device applications.
However, achieving high-performing photovoltaic devices processed at low
temperatures is still challenging. Here we reported a new method to fabricate
high-efficiency and stable $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ PSCs at lower temperatures than
was previously possible by introducing the long-chain organic cation salt
ethane-1,2-diammonium iodide (EDAI2) and regulating the content of lead acetate
(Pb(OAc)2) in the perovskite precursor solution. We find that EDAI2 acts as an
intermediate that can promote the formation of $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$, while excess
Pb(OAc)2 can further stabilize the $\gamma$-phase of CsPbI$_3$ perovskite.
Consequently, improved crystallinity and morphology and reduced carrier
recombination are observed in the CsPbI$_3$ films fabricated by the new method.
By optimizing the hole transport layer of CsPbI$_3$ inverted architecture solar
cells, we demonstrate up to 16.6% efficiencies, surpassing previous reports
examining $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ in inverted PSCs. Notably, the encapsulated solar
cells maintain 97% of their initial efficiency at room temperature and dim
light for 25 days, demonstrating the synergistic effect of EDAI2 and Pb(OAc)2
on stabilizing $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ PSCs.

<h3>Solvent-antisolvent interactions in metal halide perovskites</h3>

<p>The fabrication of metal halide perovskite films using the
solvent-engineering method is increasingly common. In this method, the
crystallisation of the perovskite layer is triggered by the application of an
antisolvent during the spin-coating of a perovskite precursor solution. Herein,
we introduce the current state of understanding of the processes involved in
the crystallisation of perovskite layers formed by solvent engineering,
focusing in particular on the role of antisolvent properties and
solvent-antisolvent interactions. By considering the impact of the Hansen
solubility parameters, we propose guidelines for selecting the appropriate
antisolvent and outline open questions and future research directions for the
fabrication of perovskite films by this method.

<h3>Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice  Gauge Theory</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11645</a>

</p><i>Jean-Yves Desaules, Thomas Iadecola, Jad C. Halimeh</i>
<p>Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy
physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of
lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the
effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance,
but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be \textit{locally} avoided by proximity to a resonance
between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show
that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions,
where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show
how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different
initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of
confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term
quantum devices.

<h3>Quantized Acoustoelectric Floquet Effect in Quantum Nanowires</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11647" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11647</a>
<br>
</p><i>Christopher Yang, Will Hunt, Gil Refael, Iliya Esin</i>
<p>External coherent fields can drive quantum materials into non-equilibrium
states, revealing exotic properties that are unattainable under equilibrium
conditions -- an approach known as ``Floquet engineering.'' While optical
lasers have commonly been used as the driving fields, recent advancements have
introduced nontraditional sources, such as coherent phonon drives. Building on
this progress, we demonstrate that driving a metallic quantum nanowire with a
coherent wave of terahertz phonons can induce an electronic steady state
characterized by a persistent quantized current along the wire. The
quantization of the current is achieved due to the coupling of electrons to the
nanowire's vibrational modes, providing the low-temperature heat bath and
energy relaxation mechanisms. Our findings underscore the potential of using
non-optical drives, such as coherent phonon sources, to induce non-equilibrium
phenomena in materials. Furthermore, our approach suggests a new method for the
high-precision detection of coherent phonon oscillations via transport
measurements.

<p>We study stability of localisation under periodic driving in many-body Stark
systems. We find that localisation is stable except near special resonant
frequencies, where resonances cause delocalisation. We provide approximate
analytical arguments and numerical evidence in support of these results. This
shows that disorder-free broken ergodicity is stable to driving, opening up the
way to studying nonequilibrium driven physics in a novel setting.

<h3>Interacting Crystalline Topological Insulators in 2D with Spin-Orbit  Coupling</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11650" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11650</a>
<br>
</p><i>Martina O. Soldini, Ömer M. Aksoy, Titus Neupert</i>
<p>Topology is routinely used to understand the physics of electronic
insulators. However, for strongly interacting electronic matter, such as Mott
insulators, a comprehensive topological characterization is still lacking. When
their ground state only contains short range entanglement and does not break
symmetries spontaneously, they generically realize crystalline symmetry
protected topological phases (cFSPTs), supporting gapless modes at the
boundaries or at the lattice defects. Here, we provide an exhaustive
classification of cFSPTs in two-dimensions (2D) with $\mathrm{U}(1)$
charge-conservation and spinful time-reversal symmetries, namely those
generically are present in spin-orbit coupled insulators, for any of the 17
wallpaper groups. It has been shown that the classification of cFSPTs can be
understood from appropriate real-space decorations of lower-dimensional
subspaces, and we expose how these relate to the Wyckoff positions of the
lattice. We find that all nontrivial one-dimensional decorations require
electronic interactions. Furthermore, we provide model Hamiltonians for various
decorations, and discuss the signatures of cFSPTs. This classification paves
the way to further explore topological interacting insulators, providing the
backbone information in generic model systems and ultimately in experiments.

<h3>A many-body perturbation approach to moiré bands in twisted bilayer  graphene</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11653" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11653</a>
<br>
</p><i>Federico Escudero</i>
<p>We develop a many-body perturbation theory to account for the emergence of
moir\'e bands in the continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene. Our framework
is build upon treating the moir\'e potential as a perturbation that transfers
electrons from one layer to another through the exchange of the three wave
vectors that define the moir\'e Brillouin zone. By working in the two-band
basis of each monolayer, we analyze the one-particle Green's function and
introduce a diagrammatic representation for the scattering processes. We then
identify the moir\'e-induced self-energy, relate it to the quasiparticle weight
and velocity of the moir\'e bands, and show how it can be obtained by summing
irreducible diagrams. We also connect the emergence of flat bands to the
behavior of the static self-energy at the magic angle. In particular, we show
that a vanishing Dirac velocity is a direct consequence of the relative
orientation of the momentum transfer vectors, suggesting that the origin of
magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene is intrinsically connected to its
geometrical properties. Our approach provides a many-body diagrammatic
framework that highlights the physical properties of the moir\'e bands.

<h3>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square  lattice antiferromagnets</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654</a>
<br>
</p><i>Yunchao Zhang, Xue-Yang Song, T. Senthil</i>
<p>Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent
to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class
of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description
and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems
on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets
is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$
flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$
gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole
perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We
argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the
familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other
words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase
of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the
critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and
does not require leaving these conventional states.

<h3>Phase sensitive information from a planar Josephson junction</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Andrew C. Yuan, Steven A. Kivelson</i>
<p>We analyze both the general symmetry-related and more microscopic
considerations that govern the Josephson tunneling across a finite planar
junction between a known $s$-wave superconductor and a candidate unconventional
superconductor (e.g., $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave). Due to the finite size of the probe,
the Josephson current possesses an edge contribution, which is shown to be the
dominant contribution under certain conditions. Thus, the dependence of the
edge contribution on the geometry of the junction can serve as a direct probe
of the symmetry of the order parameter in the unconventional superconductor.

<h3>Axial, Planar-Diagonal, Body-Diagonal Fields on the Cubic-Spin Spin  Glass in d=3: A Plethora of Ordered Phases under Finite Fields</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11701" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11701</a>
<br>
</p><i>E. Can Artun, Deniz Sarman, A. Nihat Berker</i>
<p>A nematic phase, previously seen in the d=3 classical Heisenberg spin-glass
system, occurs in the n-component cubic-spin spin-glass system, between the
low-temperature spin-glass phase and the high-temperature disordered phase, for
number of spin components n>=3, in spatial dimension d=3, thus constituting a
liquid-crystal phase in a dirty (quenched-disordered) magnet. Furthermore,
under application of a variety of uniform magnetic fields, a veritable plethora
of phases are found. Under uniform magnetic fields, 15 different phases and two
spin-glass phase diagram topologies, qualitatively different from the
conventional spin-glass phase diagram topology, are seen. The chaotic rescaling
behaviors and their Lyapunov exponents are calculated in each of these
spin-glass phase diagram topologies. These results are obtained from
renormalization-group calculations that are exact on the hierarchical lattice
and, equivalently, approximate on the hypercubic spatial lattice. Axial,
planar-diagonal, or body-diagonal finite-strength uniform fields are applied to
n=2 and 3 component cubic-spin spin-glass systems in d=3.

<h3>Nonequilibrium finite frequency resonances in differential quantum noise  driven by Majorana interference</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11702" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11702</a>
<br>
</p><i>Sergey Smirnov</i>
<p>Nonequilibrium quantum noise $S^>(\omega,V)$ measured at finite frequencies
$\omega$ and bias voltages $V$ probes Majorana bound states in a host
nanostructure via fluctuation fingerprints unavailable in average currents or
static shot noise. When Majorana interference is brought into play, it enriches
nonequilibrium states and makes their nature even more unique. Here we
demonstrate that an interference of two Majorana modes via a nonequilibrium
quantum dot gives rise to a remarkable finite frequency response of the
differential quantum noise $\partial S^>(\omega,V,\Delta\phi)/\partial V$
driven by the Majorana phase difference $\Delta\phi$. Specifically, at low bias
voltages there develops a narrow resonance of width
$\hbar\Delta\omega\sim\sin^2\Delta\phi$ at a finite frequency determined by
$V$, whereas for high bias voltages there arise two antiresonances at two
finite frequencies controlled by both $V$ and $\Delta\phi$. We show that the
maximum and minimum of these resonance and antiresonances have universal
fractional values, $3e^3/4h$ and $-e^3/4h$. Moreover, detecting the frequencies
of the antiresonances provides a potential tool to measure $\Delta\phi$ in
nonequilibrium experiments on Majorana finite frequency quantum noise.

<h3>Robust Quasi-Bound States in the continuum: Accidental and  Symmetry-Protected Variants in Dielectric Metasurfaces</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11750" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11750</a>
<br>
</p><i>Hicham Mangach, Abdelhaq Belkacem, Younes Achaoui, Abdenbi Bouzid, Boris Gralak, Sebastien Guenneau</i>
<p>Recently, man-made dielectric materials composed of finite-sized dielectric
constituents have emerged as a promising platform for quasi-bound states in the
continuum (QBICs). These states allow for an extraordinary confinement of light
within regions smaller than the wavelength scale. Known for their exceptional
quality factors, they have become crucial assets across a diverse array of
applications. Given the circumstances, there is a compelling drive to find
meta-designs that can possess multiple QBICs. Here, we demonstrate the
existence of two different types of QBICs in silicon-based metasurfaces:
accidental QBIC and symmetry-protected QBIC. The accidental QBIC evinces
notable resilience to variations in geometrical parameters and symmetry,
underscoring its capacity to adeptly navigate manufacturing tolerances while
consistently upholding a distinguished quality factor of $10^5$. Conversely,
the symmetry-protected QBIC inherently correlates with the disruption of unit
cell symmetry. As a result, a phase delay yields an efficient channel for
substantial energy transference to the continuum, endowing this variant with an
exceedingly high quality factor, approaching $10^8$. Moreover, the
manifestation of these QBICs stems from the intricate interplay among
out-of-plane electric and magnetic dipoles, alongside in-plane quadrupoles
exhibiting odd parities.

<h3>Magnetic structure and component-separated transitions of HoNiSi$_{3}$</h3>

<p>HoNiSi$_{3}$ is an intermetallic compound characterized by two successive
antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1} = 6.3$ K and $T_{N2} = 10.4$ K. Here,
its zero-field microscopic magnetic structure is inferred from resonant x-ray
magnetic diffraction experiments on a single crystalline sample that complement
previous bulk magnetic susceptibility data. For $T < T_{N2}$, the primitive
magnetic unit cell matches the chemical cell. The magnetic structure features
ferromagnetic {\it ac} planes stacked in an antiferromagnetic $\uparrow
\downarrow \uparrow \downarrow$ pattern. For $T_{N1} < T < T_{N2}$, the ordered
magnetic moment points along $\vec{a}$, and for $T < T_{N1}$ a component along
$\vec{c}$ also orders. A symmetry analysis indicates that the magnetic
structure for $T<T_{N1}$ is not compatible with the presumed orthorhombic
$Cmmm$ space group of the chemical structure, and therefore a slight lattice
distortion is implied. Mean-field calculations using a simplified magnetic
Hamiltonian, including a reduced set of three independent exchange coupling
parameters determined by density functional theory calculations and two crystal
electric field terms taken as free-fitting parameters, are able to reproduce
the main experimental observations. An alternative approach using a more
complete model including seven exchange coupling and nine crystal electric
field terms is also explored, where the search of the ground state magnetic
structure compatible with the available anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and
magnetization data is carried out with the help of an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm. The possible magnetic configurations are grouped into five
clusters, and the cluster that yields the best comparison with the experimental
macroscopic data contains the parameters previously found with the simplified
model and also predicts the correct ground-state magnetic structure.

temperatures. We observe the resonance spectra and their dependence on gate
voltage and magnetic fields. To explain the observed behavior, we construct the
possible scenario as a Fano interferometer with finite width. Our findings
reveal the potential of semiconductor defects to contribute to the development
of quantum information processing, providing their role to key components in

<h3>Coherent optical control of quantum Hall edge states</h3>

<p>Current carrying chiral edge states in quantum Hall systems have fascinating
properties that are usually studied by electron spectroscopy and
interferometry. Here we demonstrate that electron occupation, current, and
electron coherence in chiral edge states can be selectively probed and
controlled by low-energy electromagnetic radiation in the microwave to infrared
range without affecting electron states in the bulk or destroying quantum Hall
effect conditions in the bulk of the sample. Both linear and nonlinear optical
control is possible due to inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion
symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This opens up new pathways
for frequency- and polarization-selective spectroscopy and control of
individual edge states.

<h3>2D capsid formation within an oscillatory energy landscape: orderly  self-assembly depends on the interplay between a dynamic potential and  intrinsic relaxation times</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jessica K. Niblo, Jacob R. Swartley, Zhongmin Zhang, Kateri H. DuBay</i>
<p>Multiple dissipative self-assembly protocols designed to create novel
structures or to reduce kinetic traps have recently emerged. Specifically,
temporal oscillations of particle interactions have been shown effective at
both aims, but investigations thus far have focused on systems of simple
colloids or their binary mixtures. In this work, we expand our understanding of
the effect of temporally oscillating interactions to a two-dimensional
coarse-grained viral capsid-like model that undergoes a self-limited assembly.
This model includes multiple intrinsic relaxation times due to the internal
structure of the capsid subunits and, under certain interaction regimes,
proceeds via a two-step nucleation mechanism. We find that oscillations much
faster than the local intrinsic relaxation times can be described via a time
averaged inter-particle potential across a wide range of interaction strengths,
while oscillations much slower than these relaxation times result in structures
that adapt to the attraction strength of the current half-cycle. Interestingly,
oscillations periods similar to these relaxation times shift the interaction
window over which orderly assembly occurs by enabling error correction during
the half-cycles with weaker attractions. Our results provide fundamental
insights to non-equilibrium self-assembly on temporally variant energy
landscapes.

<p>Algorithms developed to solve many-body quantum problems, like tensor
networks, can turn into powerful quantum-inspired tools to tackle problems in
the classical domain. In this work, we focus on matrix product operators, a
prominent numerical technique to study many-body quantum systems, especially in
one dimension. It has been previously shown that such a tool can be used for
classification, learning of deterministic sequence-to-sequence processes and of
generic quantum processes. We further develop a matrix product operator
algorithm to learn probabilistic sequence-to-sequence processes and apply this
algorithm to probabilistic cellular automata. This new approach can accurately
learn probabilistic cellular automata processes in different conditions, even
when the process is a probabilistic mixture of different chaotic rules. In
addition, we find that the ability to learn these dynamics is a function of the
bit-wise difference between the rules and whether one is much more likely than
the other.

<p>The Dyakonov-Perel (DP) mechanism of spin relaxation has long been considered
irrelevant in centrosymmetric systems since it was developed originally for
non-centrosymmetric ones. We investigate whether this conventional
understanding extends to the realm of orbital relaxation, which has recently
attracted significant attention. Surprisingly, we find that orbital relaxation
in centrosymmetric systems exhibits the DP-like behavior in the weak scattering
regime. Moreover, the DP-like orbital relaxation can make the spin relaxation
in centrosymmetric systems DP-like through the spin-orbit coupling. We also
find that the DP-like orbital and spin relaxations are anisotropic even in
materials with high crystal symmetry (such as face-centered cubic structure)
and may depend on the orbital and spin nature of electron wavefunctions.

</p><i>José Ruiz-Franco, Andrea Giuntoli</i>
<p>Glassy polymer melts such as the plastics used in pipes, structural
materials, and medical devices are ubiquitous in daily life. They accumulate
damage over time due to their use, which limits their functionalities and
demands periodic replacement. The resulting economic and social burden could be
mitigated by the design of self-healing mechanisms that expand the lifespan of
materials. However, the characteristic low molecular mobility in glassy polymer
melts intrinsically limits the design of self-healing behavior. We demonstrate
through numerical simulations that controlled oscillatory deformations enhance
the local molecular mobility of glassy polymers without compromising their
structural or mechanical stability. We apply this principle to increase the
molecular mobility around the surface of a crack, inducing fracture repair and
recovering the mechanical properties of the pristine material. Our findings
establish a general physical mechanism of self-healing in glasses that may
inspire the design and processing of new glassy materials.

<h3>Applicability of Eliashberg theory for systems with electron-phonon and  electron-electron interaction: a comparative analysis</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11820" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11820</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shang-Shun Zhang, Zachary M. Raines, Andrey V.Chubukov</i>
<p>We present a comparative analysis of the validity of Eliashberg theory for
the cases of fermions interacting with an Einstein phonon and with soft nematic
fluctuations near an Ising-nematic/Ising-ferromagnetic quantum-critical point
(QCP). In both cases, Eliashberg theory is obtained by neglecting vertex
corrections. For the phonon case, the reasoning to neglect vertex corrections
is the Migdal ``fast electron/slow boson'' argument because the phonon velocity
is much smaller than the Fermi velocity, $v_F$. The same argument allows one to
compute the fermionic self-energy within Eliashberg theory perturbatively
rather than self-consistently. For the nematic case, the velocity of a
collective boson is comparable to $v_F$ and this argument apparently does not
work. Nonetheless, we argue that while two-loop vertex corrections near a
nematic QCP are not small parametrically, they are small numerically. At the
same time, perturbative calculation of the fermionic self-energy can be
rigorously justified when the fermion-boson coupling is small compared to the
Fermi energy. Furthermore, we argue that for the electron-phonon case
Eliashberg theory breaks down at some distance from where the dressed Debye
frequency would vanish, while for the nematic case it holds all the way to a
QCP. From this perspective, Eliashberg theory for the nematic case actually
works better than for the electron-phonon case.

<h3>Alignment-induced depression and shear thinning of anisotropic granular  media</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Huzaif Rahim, Vasileios Angelidakis, Thorsten Pöschel, Sudeshna Roy</i>
<p>When granular materials of shape-anisotropic grains are sheared in a
split-bottom shear cell, a localized shear band is formed with a depression at
its center. This effect is closely related to the alignment of the particles
with aspect ratio (AR), which, in turn, influences the local packing density,
the stress distribution, and the system's overall bulk rheology. Particles with
large AR tend to align with the shear direction, which increases the packing
density in the shear band and affects rheological properties like stress,
macroscopic friction coefficient, and effective viscosity. A scaling law
correlates particle AR to macroscopic friction and effective viscosity,
revealing shear-thinning behavior in bulk and near the surface.

</p><i>Li-Ya Qiao, Xiu-Cai Jiang, Ze Ruan, Yu-Zhong Zhang</i>
<p>Twist between neighboring layers and variation of interlayer distance are two
extra ways to control the physical properties of stacked two-dimensional van
der Waals materials without alteration of chemical compositions or application
of external fields, compared to their monolayer counterparts. In this work, we
explored the dependence of the magnetic states of the untwisted and twisted
bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ (X = S, Se) on the interlayer distance by density functional
theory calculations. We find that, while a magnetic phase transition occurs
from interlayer ferromagnetism to interlayer antiferromagnetism either as a
function of decreasing interlayer distance for the untwisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$
or after twist, richer magnetic phase transitions consecutively take place for
the twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ as interlayer distance is gradually reduced.
Besides, the critical pressures for the phase transition are greatly reduced in
twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ compared with the untwisted case. We derived the
Heisenberg model with intralayer and interlayer exchange couplings to
comprehend the emergence of various magnetic states. Our results point out an
easy access towards tunable two-dimensional magnets.

<p>Moir\'e superlattices have become an emergent solid-state platform for
simulating quantum lattice models. However, in single moir\'e device,
Hamiltonians parameters like lattice constant, hopping and interaction terms
can hardly be manipulated, limiting the controllability and accessibility of
moire quantum simulator. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that high-order moir\'e
patterns in graphene-monolayered xenon/krypton heterostructures can simulate
honeycomb model in mesoscale, with in-situ tunable Hamiltonians parameters. The
length scale of simulated lattice constant can be tuned by annealing processes,
which in-situ adjusts intervalley interaction and hopping parameters in the
simulated honeycomb lattice. The sign of the lattice constant can be switched
by choosing xenon or krypton monolayer deposited on graphene, which controls
sublattice degree of freedom and valley arrangment of Dirac fermions. Our work
establishes a novel path for experimentally simulating the honeycomb model with
tunable parameters by high-order moir\'e patterns.

<br>
</p><i>Jiucai Wang, Wen Sun, Hao-Xin Wang, Zhaoyu Han, Steven A. Kivelson, Hong Yao</i>
<p>A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity
(i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive.
Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy
effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard
model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron
density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW,
consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit.
Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in
intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these
s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of
time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from
valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.

<h3>Electrical control of a Kondo spin screening cloud</h3>

<p>In metals and semiconductors, an impurity spin is quantum entangled with and
thereby screened by surrounding conduction electrons at low temperatures,
called the Kondo screening cloud. Quantum confinement of the Kondo screening
cloud in a region, called a Kondo box, with a length smaller than the original
cloud extension length strongly deforms the screening cloud and provides a way
of controlling the entanglement. Here we realize such a Kondo box and develop
an approach to controlling and monitoring the entanglement. It is based on a
spin localized in a semiconductor quantum dot, which is screened by conduction
electrons along a quasi-one-dimensional channel. The box is formed between the
dot and a quantum point contact placed on a channel. As the quantum point
contact is tuned to make the confinement stronger, electron conductance through
the dot as a function of temperature starts to deviate from the known universal
function of the single energy scale, the Kondo temperature. Nevertheless, the
entanglement is monitored by the measured conductance according to our
theoretical development. The dependence of the monitored entanglement on the
confinement strength and temperature implies that the Kondo screening is
controlled by tuning the quantum point contact. Namely, the Kondo cloud is
deformed by the Kondo box in the region across the original cloud length. Our
findings offer a way of manipulating and detecting spatially extended quantum
many-body entanglement in solids by electrical means.

<h3>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy for Molecules: Manipulating Electrons and  Photons by Varying Buffer Layer</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Abhishek Grewal, Christopher C. Leon, Olle Gunnarsson</i>
<p>In scanning tunneling microscopy of molecules, an insulating buffer layer is
often introduced to reduce interaction between the molecules and the substrate.
Focusing on tunneling through the molecule's electronic transport gap, we
demonstrate that the buffer itself strongly influences the wave function of the
tunneling electron at the molecule. This is exemplified for an adsorbed
platinum phthalocyanine molecule by varying the composition and thickness of
the buffer. We find that, in particular, the buffer's lattice parameter is
crucial. By expanding the wave function of the tunneling electron in molecular
orbitals (MOs), we illustrate how one can strongly vary the relative weights of
different MOs, such as the highest occupied MO versus some low-lying MOs with
few nodal surfaces. The set of MOs with significant weight are important for
processes used to manipulate the state of the molecule by a tunneling electron,
such as molecular luminescence. The choice of buffer therefore provides an
important tool for manipulating these processes.

<h3>Unsupervised learning approach to quantum wavepacket dynamics from  coupled temporal-spatial correlations</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Adva Baratz, Galit Cohen, Sivan Refaely-Abramson</i>
<p>Understanding complex quantum dynamics in realistic materials requires
insight into the underlying correlations dominating the interactions between
the participating particles. Due to the wealth of information involved in these
processes, applying artificial intelligence methods is compelling. Yet,
unsupervised data-driven approaches typically focus on maximal variations of
the individual components, rather than considering the correlations between
them. Here we present an approach that recognizes correlation patterns to
explore convoluted dynamical processes. Our scheme is using singular value
decomposition (SVD) to extract dynamical features, unveiling the internal
temporal-spatial interrelations that generate the dynamical mechanisms. We
apply our approach to study light-induced wavepacket propagation in organic
crystals, of interest for applications in material based quantum computing and
quantum information science. We show how transformation from the input momentum
and time coordinates onto a new correlation-induced coordinate space allows
direct recognition of the relaxation and dephasing components dominating the
dynamics and demonstrate their dependence on the initial pulse shape.
Entanglement of the dynamical features is suggested as a pathway to reproduce
the information required for further explainability of these mechanisms. Our
method offers a route for elucidating complex dynamical processes using
unsupervised AI-based analysis in multi-component systems.

</p><i>Kansei Kanayama, Kazuaki Toyoura</i>
<p>First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations were applied for the
paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition in the perovskite-type cadmium
titanate, CdTiO3. Since the phase transition is reported to occur at the low
temperature around 80 K, the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method was utilized in
this study, which incorporates the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). The
structural evolutions in the QTB-FPMD simulations are in reasonable agreement
with the experimental results, by contrast in the conventional FPMD simulations
using the classical thermal bath (CTB-FPMD). According to our phonon
calculations, volume expansion is the key in the stabilization of the
ferroelectric phase at low temperatures, which was well reproduced in the
QTB-FPMD with the NQEs. Thus, the NQEs are of importance in phase transitions
at low temperatures, particularly below the room temperature, and the QTB is
useful in that it incorporates the NQEs in MD simulations with low
computational costs comparable to the conventional CTB.

<h3>Green and Solid State Reduction of GO Monolayers Sandwiched between  Arachidic Acid LB Layers</h3>

</p><i>V. Divakar Botcha, Pavan K. Narayanam</i>
<p>A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for
reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which,
arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by
Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to
obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C
results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA
molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of
0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant
increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease
in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors
fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a
positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and
electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets
obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited
conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of
0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets
obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO
reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be
unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of
AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach
demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers
with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device
applications.

<h3>Transport of orbital currents in systems with strong intervalley  coupling: the case of Kekulé distorted graphene</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Tarik P. Cysne, R. B. Muniz, Tatiana G. Rappoport</i>
<p>We show that orbital currents can describe the transport of orbital magnetic
moments of Bloch states in models where the formalism based on valley current
is not applicable. As a case study, we consider Kekul\'e distorted graphene. We
begin by analyzing the band structure in detail and obtain the orbital magnetic
moment operator for this model within the framework of the modern theory of
magnetism. Despite the simultaneous presence of time-reversal and
spatial-inversion symmetries, such operator may be defined, although its
expectation value at a given energy is zero. Nevertheless, its presence can be
exposed by the application of an external magnetic field. We then proceed to
study the transport of these quantities. In the Kekul\'e-$O$ distorted graphene
model, the strong coupling between different valleys prevents the definition of
a bulk valley current. However, the formalism of the orbital Hall effect
together with the non-Abelian description of the magnetic moment operator can
be directly applied to describe its transport in these types of models. We show
that the Kekul\'e-$O$ distorted graphene model exhibits an orbital Hall
insulating plateau whose height is inversely proportional to the energy band
gap produced by intervalley coupling. Our results strengthen the perspective of
using the orbital Hall effect formalism as a preferable alternative to the
valley Hall effect

</p><i>Alvise Bastianello, Žiga Krajnik, Enej Ilievski</i>
<p>The classical Landau--Lifshitz equation -- the simplest model of a
ferromagnet -- provides an archetypal example for studying transport phenomena.
In one-spatial dimension, integrability enables the classification of the
spectrum of linear and nonlinear modes. An exact characterization of
finite-temperature thermodynamics and transport has nonetheless remained
elusive. We present an exact description of thermodynamic equilibrium states in
terms of interacting modes. This is achieved by retrieving the classical
Landau--Lifschitz model through the semiclassical limit of the integrable
quantum spin-$S$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain at the level of the thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz description. In the axial regime, the mode spectrum comprises
solitons with unconventional statistics, whereas in the planar regime we
additionally find two special types of modes of radiative and solitonic type.
The obtained framework paves the way for analytical study of unconventional
transport properties: as an example we study the finite-temperature spin Drude
weight, finding excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

<h3>Impact of non-reciprocal interactions on colloidal self-assembly with  tunable anisotropy</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12108" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12108</a>
<br>
</p><i>Salman Fariz Navas, Sabine H. L. Klapp</i>
<p>Non-reciprocal (NR) effective interactions violating Newton's third law occur
in many biological systems, but can also be engineered in synthetic, colloidal
systems. Recent research has shown that such NR interactions can have
tremendous effects on the overall collective behaviour and pattern formation,
but can also influence aggregation processes on the particle scale. Here we
focus on the impact of non-reciprocity on the self-assembly of an (originally
passive) colloidal system with anisotropic interactions whose character is
tunable by external fields. In the absence of non-reciprocity, that is, under
equilibrium conditions, the colloids form aggregates with extremely long life
times [Kogler et al., Soft Matter 11, 7356 (2015)], indicating kinetic
trapping. Here we study, based on Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations in 2D, a
NR version of this model consisting of two species with reciprocal isotropic,
but NR anisotropic interactions. We find that NR induces an effective
propulsion of particle pairs and small aggregates forming at initial stages of
self-assembly, an indication of the NR-induced non-equilibrium. The shape and
stability of these initial clusters strongly depends on the degree of
anisotropy. At longer times we find, for weak NR interactions, large (even
system-spanning) clusters where single particles can escape and enter at the
boundaries, in stark contrast to the small rigid aggregates appearing at the
same time in the passive case. In this sense, weak NR shortcuts the
aggregation. Increasing the degree of NR (and thus, propulsion), we even
observe large-scale phase separation if the interactions are weakly
anisotropic. In contrast, system with strong NR and anisotropy remain
essentially disordered. Overall, NR interactions are shown to destabilize the
rigid aggregates interrupting self-assembly in the passive case, helping the
system to overcome kinetic barriers.

<p>Antiferromagnetic FeSn is considered to be a close realization of the ideal
two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice, hosting Dirac cones, van Hove
singularities, and flat bands, as it comprises Fe$_3$Sn kagome layers well
separated by Sn buffer layers. We observe a pronounced optical anisotropy, with
the low-energy optical conductivity being surprisingly higher perpendicular to
the kagome planes than along the layers. This finding contradicts the prevalent
picture of dominantly 2D electronic structure for FeSn. Our material-specific
theory reproduces the measured conductivity spectra remarkarbly well. A
site-specific decomposition of the optical response to individual excitation
channels shows that the optical conductivity for polarizations both parallel
and perpendicular to the kagome plane is dominated by interlayer transitions
between kagome layers and adjacent Sn-based layers. Moreover, the matrix
elements corresponding to these transitions are highly anisotropic, leading to
larger out-of-plane conductivity. Our results evidence the crucial role of
interstitial layers in charge dynamics even in seemingly 2D systems.

electron susceptibility. Here, we study this influence in a series of 4f
antiferromagnets, GdT2Si2 (T=Co, Rh, Ir), using ultrafast resonant X-ray
diffraction. We observe a twofold increase in ultrafast angular momentum
transfer between the materials, originating from modifications in the

<p>When materials are patterned in three dimensions, there exist opportunities
to tailor and create functionalities associated with an increase in complexity,
the breaking of symmetries, and the introduction of curvature and non-trivial
topologies. For superconducting nanostructures, the extension to the third
dimension may trigger the emergence of new physical phenomena, as well as
advances in technologies. Here, we harness three-dimensional (3D)
nanopatterning to fabricate and control the emergent properties of a 3D
superconducting nanostructure. Not only are we able to demonstrate the
existence and motion of superconducting vortices in 3D but, with simulations,
we show that the confinement leads to a well-defined bending of the vortices
within the volume of the structure. Moreover, we experimentally observe a
strong geometrical anisotropy of the critical field, through which we achieve
the reconfigurable coexistence of superconducting and normal states in our 3D
superconducting architecture, and the local definition of weak links. In this
way, we uncover an intermediate regime of nanosuperconductivity, where the
vortex state is truly three-dimensional and can be designed and manipulated by
geometrical confinement. This insight into the influence of 3D geometries on
superconducting properties offers a route to local reconfigurable control for
future computing devices, sensors, and quantum technologies.

<p>Several systems may display an equilibrium condensation transition, where a
finite fraction of a conserved quantity is spatially localized. The presence of
two conservation laws may induce the emergence of such transition in an
out-of-equilibrium setup, where boundaries are attached to two different and
subcritical heat baths. We study this phenomenon in a class of stochastic
lattice models, where the local energy is a general convex function of the
local mass, mass and energy being both globally conserved in the isolated
system. We obtain exact results for the nonequilibrium steady state (spatial
profiles, mass and energy currents, Onsager coefficients) and we highlight
important differences between equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium condensation.

<p>Crystal seeding enables a deeper understanding of phase behavior, leading to

in various applications such as materials synthesis, crystallization processes,
and phase transformation engineering. How to seed a crystalline in time domain
is an open question, which is of great significant and may provide an avenue to
understand and control time-dependent quantum many-body physics. Here, we
utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce the formation of a discrete time
crystal in Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the periodic
driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded crystalline order in subspace, which
triggers the time-translation symmetry breaking across the entire ensemble. The
behavior of the emergent time crystal is elaborately linked to alterations in
the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which
result in phase dependent seeding and corresponding shift in periodicity of the
time crystal, leading to embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new
possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body
phenomena, offering insights into the behavior of complex many-body systems

<p>The Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) has become a prominent tool for the optical
simulation of thin$-$film solar cells, particularly among researchers
specializing in organic semiconductors and perovskite materials. As the
commercial viability of these solar cells continues to advance, driven by rapid
developments in materials and production processes, the importance of optical
simulation has grown significantly. By leveraging optical simulation,
researchers can gain profound insights into photovoltaic phenomena, empowering
the implementation of device optimization strategies to achieve enhanced
performance. However, existing TMM$-$based packages exhibit limitations, such
as requiring programming expertise, licensing fees, or lack of support for
bilayer device simulation. In response to these gaps and challenges, we present

<h3>Attosecond dynamics of electron scattering by an absorbing layer</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12206" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12206</a>
<br>
</p><i>R.O. Kuzian, E. E. Krasovskii</i>
<p>Attosecond dynamics of electron reflection from a thin film is studied based
on a one-dimensional jellium model. Following the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith
concept, the reflection time delay $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}$ is calculated as the
energy derivative of the phase of the complex reflection amplitude $r$. For a
purely elastic scattering by a jellium slab of a finite thickness $d$ the
transmission probability $T$ oscillates with the momentum $K$ in the solid with
a period $\pi/d$, and $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}$ closely follows these oscillations.
The reflection delay averaged over an energy interval grows with $d$, but in
the limit of $d\to\infty$ the amplitude $r$ becomes real, so $\Delta\tau_{\rm
R}$ vanishes. This picture changes substantially with the inclusion of an
absorbing potential $-iV_{\rm i}$: As expected, for a sufficiently thick slab
the reflection amplitude now tends to its asymptotic value for a semi-infinite
crystal. Interestingly, for $V_{\rm i} \ne 0$, around the $T(E)$ maxima, the
$\Delta\tau_{\rm R}(E)$ curve strongly deviates from $T(E)$, showing a narrow
dip just at the $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}(E)$ maximum for $V_{\rm i}=0$. An
analytical theory of this counterintuitive behavior is developed.

<h3>Spin-1 Haldane chains of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12207" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12207</a>
<br>
</p><i>Virgil V. Baran, Jens Paaske</i>
<p>We theoretically explore the possibility of realizing the symmetry-protected
topological Haldane phase of spin-1 chains in a tunable hybrid platform of
superconducting islands (SIs) and quantum dots (QDs). Inspired by recent
findings suggesting that an appropriately tuned QD-SI-QD block may behave as a
robust spin-1 unit, we study the behavior of many such units tunnel-coupled
into linear chains. Our efficient and fully microscopic modeling of long chains
with several tens of units is enabled by the use of the surrogate model solver
[Phys. Rev. B 108, L220506 (2023); arXiv:2402.18357]. Our numerical findings
indicate that the QD-SI-QD chains exhibit emblematic features of the Haldane
phase, such as fractional spin-1/2 edge states and non-vanishing string order
parameters, and that these persist over a sizeable region of parameter space.
Increasing the coupling between neighboring units gradually degrades their
individual spin-1 character and leads to a trivial dimerized phase.

<h3>Anomalous diffusion and effective shear modulus in a semi-solid membrane</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12211" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12211</a>
<br>
</p><i>Vikash Pandey, Dhrubaditya Mitra</i>
<p>From the perspective of physical properties, the cell membrane is an exotic
two-dimensional material that has a dual nature: it exhibits characteristics of
fluids, i.e., lipid molecules show lateral diffusion, while also demonstrating
properties of solids, evidenced by a non-zero shear modulus. We construct a
model for such a $\textit{semi-solid}$ $\textit{membrane}$. Our model is a
fluctuating randomly triangulated mesh with two different kinds of nodes. The
solid nodes never change their neighbors, while the fluid nodes do. As the area
fraction occupied by the solid nodes ($\Phi$) is increased the motion of fluid
nodes transition from diffusion to localization via subdiffusion. Next, the
solid nodes are pinned to mimic the pinning of the plasma membrane to the
cytoskeleton. For the pinned membrane, there exists a range of $\Phi$ over
which the model has both a non-zero shear modulus and a non-zero lateral
diffusivity. The bending modulus, measured through the spectrum of height
fluctuations remains unchanged.

<h3>Traveling strings of active dipolar colloids</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12218</a>
<br>
</p><i>Xichen Chao, Katherine Skipper, C. Patrick Royall, Silke Henkes, Tanniemola B. Liverpool</i>
<p>We study an intriguing new type of self-assembled active colloidal polymer
system in 3D. It is obtained from a suspension of Janus particles in an
electric field that induces parallel dipoles in the particles as well as
self-propulsion in the plane perpendicular to the field. At low packing
fractions, in experiment, the particles self-assemble into 3D columns that are
self-propelled in 2D. Explicit numerical simulations combining dipolar
interactions and active self-propulsion find an activity dependent transition
to a string phase by increasing dipole strength. We classify the collective
dynamics of strings as a function of rotational and translational diffusion.
Using an anisotropic version of the Rouse model of polymers with active
driving, we analytically compute the strings' collective dynamics and centre of
mass motion, which matches simulations and is consistent with experimental
data. We also discover long range correlations of the fluctuations along the
string contour that grow with the active persistence time, a purely active
effect that disappears in the thermal limit.

<h3>Model geometries of porous materials</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Felix Buchele, Patric Müller, Michael Blank, Thorsten Pöschel</i>
<p>We describe a method for modeling the geometry of porous materials. The
approach enables the independent selection of crucial parameters, including
porosity, pore size distribution, pore shape, and connectivity. Consequently,
it can effectively model a wide range of porous systems. Due to the diverse and
systematic variation possibilities, the method is suitable for developing and
optimizing porous structures. The geometries can be exported as triangular
meshes, facilitating their immediate use in numerical simulation and further
digital processing. We showcase the method's capabilities by minimizing the
foam structure's thermal conductivity through geometry optimization.

<h3>Effects of Reduced Interlayer Interactions on the K-point Excitons of  MoS$_2$ Nanoscrolls</h3>

</p><i>Sagnik Chatterjee, Tamaghna Chowdhury, Pablo Díaz Núñez, Nicholas Kay, Manisha Rajput, Sooyeon Hwang, Ivan Timokhin, Artem Mishchenko, Atikur Rahman</i>
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoscrolls (NS) exhibit significant
photoluminescence (PL) signals despite their multilayer structure, which cannot
be explained by the strained multilayer description of NS. Here, we investigate
the interlayer interactions in NS to address this discrepancy. The reduction of
interlayer interactions in NS is attributed to two factors: (1) the
symmetry-broken mixed stacking order between neighbouring layers due to
misalignment, and (2) the high inhomogeneity in the strain landscape resulting
from the unique Archimedean spiral-like geometry with positive eccentricity.
These were confirmed through transmission electron microscopy, field emission
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. To probe the effect
of reduction of interlayer interactions in multilayered MoS$_2$ nanoscrolls,
low-temperature PL spectroscopy was employed investigating the behaviour of
K-point excitons. The effects of reduced interlayer interactions on
exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC), exciton energy, and exciton oscillator strength
are discussed, providing insights into the unique properties of TMD
nanoscrolls.

<h3>Theory of Mobility Rings in Non-Hermitian Systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266</a>
<br>
</p><i>Shan-Zhong Li, Zhi Li</i>
<p>Through Avila global theorem, we analytically study the non-Hermitian
mobility edge. The results show that the mobility edge in non-Hermitian systems
has a ring structure, which we named as "mobility ring". Furthermore, we carry
out numerical analysis of the eigenenergy spectra in several typical cases, and
the consistence of the numerical results with the analytical expression proves
the correctness and universality of the mobility ring theory. Further, based on
the analytical expression, we discuss the properties of multiple mobility
rings. Finally, we compare the results of mobility rings with that of dual
transformations, and find that although the self-dual method can give the
interval of real eigenvalues corresponding to the extended states, it can not
fully display the mobility edge information in the complex plane. The mobility
ring theory proposed in this paper is universal for all non-Hermitian systems.

<h3>Emergent Anti-Ferroelectric Ordering and the Coupling of Liquid  Crystalline and Polar Order</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Jordan Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, Richard. J. Mandle</i>
<p>Polar liquid crystals possess three dimensional orientational order coupled
with unidirectional electric polarity, yielding fluid ferroelectrics. Such
polar phases are generated by rod-like molecules with large electric dipole
moments. 2,5-Disubstituted 1,3-dioxane is commonly employed as a polar motif in
said systems, and here we show this to suffer from thermal instability as a
consequence of equatorial-trans to axial-trans isomerism at elevated
temperatures. We utilise isosteric building blocks as potential replacements
for the 1,3- dioxane unit, and in doing so we obtain new examples of fluid
ferroelectric systems. For binary mixtures of certain composition, we observe
the emergence of a new fluid antiferroelectric phase - a finding not observed
for either of the parent molecules. Our study also reveals a critical tipping
point for the emergence of polar order in otherwise apolar systems. These
results hint at the possibility for uncovering new highly ordered polar LC
phases and delineate distinct transition mechanisms in orientational and polar
ordering.

<p>Realization of noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl metals is expected to exhibit
anomalous transport properties stemming from the interplay of unusual bulk
electronic topology and magnetism. Here, we present spin-valve-like
magnetoresistance at room temperature in ferrimagneticWeyl metal Mn$_2$PdSn
that crystallizes in the inverse Heusler structure. Anomalous magnetoresistance
display dominant asymmetric component attributed to domain wall electron
scattering, indicative of spin-valve-like behavior. Ab initio calculations
confirm the topologically non-trivial nature of the band structure, with three
pairs of Weyl nodes proximate to the Fermi level, providing deeper insights
into the observed intrinsic Berry curvature mediated substantial anomalous Hall
conductivity. Our results underscore the inverse Heusler compounds as promising
platform to realize magnetic Weyl metals/semimetals and leverage emergent
transport properties for electronic functionalities.

<h3>Extended unitarity and absence of skin effect in periodically driven  systems</h3>
<p><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12297" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12297</a>
<br>
</p><i>Aditi Chakrabarty, Sanjoy Datta</i>
<p>One of the most striking features of non-Hermitian quasiperiodic systems with
arbitrarily small asymmetry in the hopping amplitudes and open boundaries is
the accumulation of all the bulk eigenstates at one of the edges of the system,
termed in literature as the skin effect, below a critical strength of the
potential. In this Letter, we uncover that a time-periodic drive in such
systems can eliminate the SE up to a finite strength of this asymmetry.
Remarkably, the critical value for the onset of SE is independent of the
driving frequency and approaches to the static behavior in the thermodynamic
limit. We find that the absence of SE is intricately linked to the emergence of
extended unitarity in the delocalized phase, providing dynamical stability to
the system. Interestingly, under periodic boundary condition, our non-Hermitian
system can be mapped to a Hermitian analogue in the large driving frequency
limit that leads to the extended unitarity irrespective of the hopping
asymmetry and the strength of the quasiperiodic potential, in stark contrast to
the static limit. Additionally, we numerically verify that this behavior
persists Based on our findings, we propose a possible experimental realization
of our driven system, which could be used as a switch to control the light
funneling mechanism.

<h3>Investigation of Spin-Pumping and -Transport in the Ni80Fe20/Pt/Co  Asymmetric Trilayer</h3>

<br>
</p><i>Shilpa Samdani, Yaqi Rong, Birte Coester, Amit Kumar Shukla, Lew Wen Siang, Yumeng Yang, Rajdeep Singh Rawat</i>
<p>FM1/NM/FM2 trilayers have garnered considerable attention because of their
potential in spintronic applications. A thorough investigation of the spin
transport properties of these trilayers is therefore important. Asymmetric
trilayers, particularly those including Platinum (Pt) as a spacer are less
explored. Pt mediates exchange coupling between the two FM layers and thus
offers a unique platform to investigate the spin-transport properties under
indirect exchange coupling conditions through the spin-pumping mechanism. Our
analytical focus on the acoustic mode of the ferromagnetic resonance spectrum,
facilitated by the distinct magnetizations of the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers,
allows for the isolation of individual layer resonances. The derived
spin-pumping induced damping of the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers reveals a direct
dependence on the Pt spacer thickness. Furthermore, fitting of the weighted
average of the damping parameters to the spin-pumping induced damping of
acoustic mode reveals that the observed FMR spectra is indeed a result of the
in-phase precession of the magnetizations in two FM layers. The extracted
effective spin-mixing conductance varies with the FM/NM interface, specifically
1.72x10^19 m^(-2) at the Ni80Fe20/Pt and 4.07x10^19 m^(-2) at the Co/Pt
interface, indicating a strong correlation with interfacial characteristics.
Additionally, we deduce the spin diffusion length in Pt to be between 1.02 and
1.55 nm and calculate the interfacial spin transparency and spin current
densities, highlighting significant disparities between the Ni80Fe20/Pt and
Co/Pt interfaces. This detailed analysis enhances our understanding of spin
transport in Ni80Fe20/Pt/Co trilayers. It offers insights important for
advancing spintronic device design and lays the groundwork for future
theoretical investigations of trilayer system.

<h3>Area laws and thermalization from classical entropies in a Bose-Einstein  condensate</h3>

<p>The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for
characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their
importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is
challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state.
Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture the very same
features as their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We
describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein
condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin
observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically
unbiased k-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of
quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization
revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by
non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be
observed at small sample numbers without assuming a specific functional form of
the distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety
of models and experimental platforms.

suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof
contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field
theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a
non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we
estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any
additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor
estimators.

</p><i>Priya Viji, Constantin Tormann, Clemens Göhler, Martijn Kemerink</i>
<p>Hot-carrier solar cells use the photon excess energy, that is, the energy
exceeding the absorber bandgap, to do additional work. These devices have the
potential to beat the upper limit for the photovoltaic power conversion
efficiency set by near-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, since their
conceptual inception in 1982, making this concept work under practical
conditions has proven a tremendous hurdle, mostly due to the fast
thermalization of photo-generated charges in typical semiconductor materials
like silicon. Here, we use noise spectroscopy in combination with numerical
modelling to show that common bulk heterojunction organic solar cells actually
work as hot-carrier devices. Due to static energetic disorder, thermalization
of photo-generated electrons and holes in the global density of states is slow
compared to the charge carrier lifetime, leading to thermal populations of
localized charge carriers that have an electronic temperature exceeding the
lattice temperature. Since charge extraction takes place in a high-lying,
narrow energy window around the transport energy, the latter takes the role of
an energy filter. For common disorder values, this leads to substantial
enhancements in open circuit voltage. We expect these results to inspire new
strategies to more efficiently convert solar energy into electricity.

</p><i>Shuai Li, Ming Gong, Yu-Hang Li, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie</i>
<p>Axion insulators possess a quantized axion field $\theta=\pi$ protected by
combined lattice and time-reversal symmetry, holding great potential for device
applications in layertronics and quantum computing. Here, we propose a
high-spin axion insulator (HSAI) defined in large spin-$s$ representation,
which maintains the same inherent symmetry but possesses a notable axion field
$\theta=(s+1/2)^2\pi$. Such distinct axion field is confirmed independently by
the direct calculation of the axion term using hybrid Wannier functions,
layer-resolved Chern numbers, as well as the topological magneto-electric
effect. We show that the guaranteed gapless quasi-particle excitation is absent
at the boundary of the HSAI despite its integer surface Chern number, hinting
an unusual quantum anomaly violating the conventional bulk-boundary
correspondence. Furthermore, we ascertain that the axion field $\theta$ can be
precisely tuned through an external magnetic field, enabling the manipulation
of bonded transport properties. The HSAI proposed here can be experimentally
verified in ultra-cold atoms by the quantized non-reciprocal conductance or
topological magnetoelectric response. Our work enriches the understanding of
axion insulators in condensed matter physics, paving the way for future device
applications.

</p><i>Daniel Schwalbe-Koda, Sebastien Hamel, Babak Sadigh, Fei Zhou, Vincenzo Lordi</i>
<p>An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in
atomistic modeling, such as sampling methods, detecting rare events, analyzing
datasets, or performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning
(ML)-driven simulations. Although individual methods have been proposed for
each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating
their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that
unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset
optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging
materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that,
for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of
atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy.
Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy
differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify
rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these
results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in
datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining
trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning
strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using
information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales
to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors. This method is made
available as the package QUESTS: Quick Uncertainty and Entropy via STructural
Similarity, providing a new unifying theory for data-driven atomistic modeling
and combining efforts in ML, first-principles thermodynamics, and simulations.

<p>The Kondo lattice physics, describing the hybridization of localized spin
matrix with dispersive conduction electrons, breeds numerous discoveries in the
realm of strongly correlated quantum matter. Generally observed in lanthanide
and actinide compounds, increasing attention has been directed towards
alternative pathways for achieving flat band structures, such as Morie
superlattices and Kagome metals. However, fine control of Kondo interaction
outside of heterostructures remains elusive. Here we report the discovery of a
van der Waals (vdW) kagome antiferromagnet CsCr6Sb6. Angle-resolved
photoemission spectra and theoretical analysis show clear flat bands,
consisting of half-filled 3dxz and 3dyz orbitals of Cr, situated 50 meV below
the Fermi level. Importantly, we observe the emergence of anomalous Hall effect
with remarkable tunability by simple reduction the sample thickness. The
effective control of kondo interaction in CsCr6Sb6 render it an ideal platform
for exploring unpresented phenomena using the vast toolkit of vdW structures.

<p>We theoretically investigate elementary excitations of dipolar quantum gases
across the superfluid to supersolid phase transition in a toroidal trap. We
show how decoupled first sound, second sound, and Higgs modes emerge by
following their origin from superfluid modes across the transition. The
structure of these excitations reveals the interplay between crystal and
superfluid oscillations. Our results unify previous notions of coupled
Goldstone and Higgs modes in harmonic traps, allowing us to establish a
correspondence between excitations of trapped and infinitely extended
supersolids. We propose protocols for selectively probing these sound and
amplitude modes, accessible to state-of-the-art experiments.
