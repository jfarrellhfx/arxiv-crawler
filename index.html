<h3>Adsorption of melting DNA</h3>

The melting of a homopolymer double-stranded (ds) DNA is studied numerically,
in the presence of an attractive and impenetrable surface on a simple cubic
lattice. The two strands of the DNA are modelled using two self-avoiding walks,
capable of interacting at complementary sites, thereby mimicking the base
pairing. The impenetrable surface is modelled by restricting the DNA
configurations at the $z\geq 0$ plane, with attractive interactions for
monomers at $z=0$. Further, we consider two variants for $z=0$ occupations by
ds segments, where one or two surface interactions are counted. This
consideration has significant consequences, to the extent of changing the
stability of the bound phase in the adsorbed state. Interestingly, adsorption
changes to first-order on coinciding with the melting transition.

<h3>Superconducting Diode Effect -- Fundamental Concepts, Material Aspects,  and Device Prospects</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13564" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13564</a>

Superconducting diode effect, in analogy to the nonreciprocal resistive
charge transport in semiconducting diode, is a nonreciprocity of
dissipationless supercurrent. Such an exotic phenomenon originates from
intertwining between symmetry-constrained supercurrent transport and intrinsic
quantum functionalities of helical/chiral superconductors. In this article,
research progress of superconducting diode effect including fundamental
concepts, material aspects, device prospects, and theoretical/experimental
development is reviewed. First, fundamental mechanisms to cause superconducting
diode effect including simultaneous space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry
breaking, magnetochiral anisotropy, interplay between spin-orbit interaction
energy and the characteristic energy scale of supercurrent carriers, and
finite-momentum Cooper pairing are discussed. Second, the progress of
superconducting diode effect from theoretical predictions to experimental
observations are reviewed. Third, interplay between various system parameters
leading to superconducting diode effect with optimal performance is presented.
Then, it is explicitly highlighted that nonreciprocity of supercurrent can be
characterized either by current-voltage relation obtained from resistive
direct-current measurements in the metal-superconductor fluctuation region
($T\approx T_c$) or by current-phase relation and nonreciprocity of superfluid
inductance obtained from alternating-current measurements in the
superconducting phase ($T<T_c$). Finally, insight into future directions in
this active research field is provided with a perspective analysis on
intertwining between band-topology and helical superconductivity, which could
be useful to steer the engineering of emergent topological superconducting
technologies.

<h3>Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition of PtSe2</h3>

Platinum diselenide (PtSe2), a novel two-dimensional material from the class
of noble-metal dichalcogenide (NMD), has recently received significant
attention due to its outstanding properties. PtSe2, which undergoes a semi
metallic to semiconductor transition when thinned, offers a band-gap in the
infrared range and good air stability. These properties make it a prime active
material in optoelectronic and chemical sensing devices. However, a synthesis
method that can produce large-scale and reliable high quality PtSe2 is highly
sought after. Here, we present PtSe2 growth by metal organic chemical vapor
deposition. Films were grown on a variety of centimeter scale substrates and
were characterized by Raman, X-ray photoelectron and X-ray diffraction
spectroscopy, as well as scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.
Domains within the films are found to be up to several hundred nanometers in
size, and atomic scale measurements show their highly ordered crystalline
structure. The thickness of homogenous films can be controlled via the growth
time. This work provides fundamental guidance for the synthesis and
implementation of high quality, large-scale PtSe2 layers, hence offering the
key requirement for the implementation of PtSe2 in future electronic devices.

<h3>Active Nematic Multipoles: Flow Responses and the Dynamics of Defects  and Colloids</h3>

We introduce a general description of localised distortions in active
nematics using the framework of active nematic multipoles. We give the
Stokesian flows for arbitrary multipoles in terms of differentiation of a
fundamental flow response and describe them explicitly up to quadrupole order.
We also present the response in terms of the net active force and torque
associated to the multipole. This allows the identification of the dipolar and
quadrupolar distortions that generate self-propulsion and self-rotation
respectively and serves as a guide for the design of arbitrary flow responses.
Our results can be applied to both defect loops in three-dimensional active
nematics and to systems with colloidal inclusions. They reveal the
geometry-dependence of the self-dynamics of defect loops and provide insights
into how colloids might be designed to achieve propulsive or rotational
dynamics, and more generally for the extraction of work from active nematics.
Finally, we extend our analysis also to two dimensions and to systems with
chiral active stresses.

<h3>Stochastic approaches: modeling the probability of encounters between  H$_{2}$-molecules and metallic atomic clusters in a cubic box</h3>

In recent years the advance of chemical synthesis has made it possible to
obtain \textquotedblleft naked\textquotedblright clusters of different
transition metals. It is well known that cluster experiments allow studying the
fundamental reactive behavior of catalytic materials in an environment that
avoids the complications present in extended solid-phase research. In
physicochemical terms, the question that arises is the chemical reduction of
metallic clusters could be affected by the presence of H$_{_{2}}$ molecules,
that is, by the probability of encounter that these small metal atomic
agglomerates can have with these reducing species. Therefore, we consider the
stochastic movement of $N$ molecules of hydrogen in a cubic box containing $M$
metallic atomic clusters in a confined region of the box. We use a Wiener
process to simulate the stochastic process, with $\sigma$ given by the
Maxwell-Boltzmann relationships, which enabled us to obtain an analytical
expression for the probability density function. This expression is an exact
expression, obtained under an original proposal outlined in this work,
\textit{i.e.} obtained from considerations of \textit{mathematical rebounds}.
On this basis, we obtained the probability of encounter for three different
volumes, $0.1^{^{3}}$, $ 0.2^{^{3}} $ and $ 0.4^{^{3}} $ m$^{^{3}}$, at three
different temperatures in each case, $293$, $373$ and $473$ K, for $
10^{^{1}}\leq N \leq10^{^{10}}$, comparing the results with those obtained
considering the distribution of the position as a Truncated Normal
Distribution. Finally, we observe that the probability is significantly
affected by the number $N$ of molecules and by the size of the box, not by the
temperature.

<h3>Wave function network description and Kolmogorov complexity of quantum  many-body systems</h3>

Programmable quantum devices are now able to probe wave functions at
unprecedented levels. This is based on the ability to project the many-body
state of atom and qubit arrays onto a measurement basis which produces
snapshots of the system wave function. Extracting and processing information
from such observations remains, however, an open quest. One often resorts to
analyzing low-order correlation functions - i.e., discarding most of the
available information content. Here, we introduce wave function networks - a
mathematical framework to describe wave function snapshots based on network
theory. For many-body systems, these networks can become scale free - a
mathematical structure that has found tremendous success in a broad set of
fields, ranging from biology to epidemics to internet science. We demonstrate
the potential of applying these techniques to quantum science by introducing
protocols to extract the Kolmogorov complexity corresponding to the output of a
quantum simulator, and implementing tools for fully scalable cross-platform
certification based on similarity tests between networks. We demonstrate the
emergence of scale-free networks analyzing data from Rydberg quantum simulators
manipulating up to 100 atoms. We illustrate how, upon crossing a phase
transition, the system complexity decreases while correlation length increases
- a direct signature of build up of universal behavior in data space. Comparing
experiments with numerical simulations, we achieve cross-certification at the
wave-function level up to timescales of 4 $\mu$ s with a confidence level of
90%, and determine experimental calibration intervals with unprecedented
accuracy. Our framework is generically applicable to the output of quantum
computers and simulators with in situ access to the system wave function, and
requires probing accuracy and repetition rates accessible to most currently
available platforms.

<h3>Identifying quantum many-body integrability and chaos using eigenstates  trace distances</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13218" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13218</a>

<i>Reyhaneh Khasseh, Jiaju Zhang, Markus Heyl, M. A. Rajabpour</i>
<br>
<br>
While the concepts of quantum many-body integrability and chaos are of
fundamental importance for the understanding of quantum matter, their precise
definition has so far remained an open question. In this work, we introduce an
alternative indicator for quantum many-body integrability and chaos, which is
based on the statistics of eigenstates by means of nearest-neighbor subsystem
trace distances. We show that this provides us with a faithful classification
through extensive numerical simulations for a large variety of paradigmatic
model systems including random matrix theories, free fermions, Bethe-ansatz
solvable systems, and models of many-body localization. While existing
indicators, such as those obtained from level-spacing statistics, have already
been utilized with great success, they also face limitations. This concerns for
instance the quantum many-body kicked top, which is exactly solvable but
classified as chaotic in certain regimes based on the level-spacing statistics,
while our introduced indicator signals the expected quantum many-body
integrability. We discuss the universal behaviors we observe for the
nearest-neighbor trace distances and point out that our indicator might be
useful also in other contexts such as for the many-body localization
transition.

There has been much interest over many years in studying charged systems
after the artificial imposition of periodic boundary conditions, and correcting
for the resulting divergence of the electrostatic energy density. A correction
for cubic cells was derived by Makov and Payne in 1995, and its leading error
term is of the form $L^{-5}$ for a cube of side $L$. Most modern Density
Functional Theory codes use a different treatment of the `Z$\alpha$' energy
term to that used by Makov and Payne, resulting in an error term of the form
$L^{-3}$ if their correction is used unmodified. This paper shows how the Makov
and Payne result can be made consistent with modern practice.

In this chapter I discuss the impact of concepts of Quantum Field Theory in
modern Condensed Physics. Although the interplay between these two areas is
certainly not new, the impact and mutual cross-fertilization has certainly
grown enormously with time, and quantum Field Theory has become a central
conceptual tool in Condensed Matter Physics. In this chapter I cover how these
ideas and tools have influenced our understanding of phase transitions, both
classical and quantum, as well as topological phases of matter, and dualities.

<h3>Revealing Rheological Parameters of Cotton-stitch-modified Cotton  Fabrics by Three-Network Modeling (TNM) of Materials</h3>

Cotton threads and fabrics are the most used textile materials and have
garnered widespread interest for smart textiles to capture human-centered
cyber-physical and human-health-related bioanalytical data. Cotton threads are
sewn (manually or digitally) into fabrics to achieve functional and fashion
stitches that soften or stiffen the base fabric. There has been limited
investigation into the influence of a single stitch on the mechanical
properties of knitted cotton fabric. Such understanding may become critical to
producing optimized textile-based composites/smart materials involving sewing
operations. While stitching operations are investigated in numerous ways to
produce a range of smart wearables, herein, we demonstrate the rheological
modification of base cotton fabric induced by two types of singular stitches
(straight and zigzag). We have sewn simple straight and zigzag cotton stitches
to investigate the rheological modification of the base cotton fabrics.
Uniaxial stress-strain experimental data, combined with constitutive modeling
(i.e., three-network model, TNM) obtained from the calibration software
(MCalibration), revealed the feasibility of a data-driven approach to
investigate the rheological parameters. Our experimental analyses, combined
with the calibrated data, suggest a 99.99% confidence in assessing the
influence of a single stitch on knitted cotton fabrics. We have also used
distributed strain energy to analyze the mechanics and failure of the base and
stitched fabrics. Our study may enable the design and study of integrating
smart threads in cotton fabrics to produce smart wearables, e-textile,
biomedical and e-fashion textiles.

<h3>Transport properties in liquids from first principles: the case of  liquid water and liquid Argon</h3>

Shear and bulk viscosity of liquid water and Argon are evaluated from first
principles in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, by performing
Molecular Dynamics simulations in the NVE ensemble and using the Kubo-Greenwood
equilibrium approach. Standard DFT functional is corrected in such a way to
allow for a reasonable description of van der Waals (vdW) effects. For liquid
Argon the thermal conductivity has been also calculated. Concerning liquid
water, to our knowledge this is the first estimate of the bulk viscosity and of
the shear-viscosity/bulk-viscosity ratio from first principles. By analyzing
our results we can conclude that our first-principles simulations, performed at
a nominal average temperature of 366 K to guarantee that the systems is
liquid-like, actually describe the basic dynamical properties of liquid water
at about 330 K. In comparison with liquid water, the normal, monatomic liquid
Ar is characterized by a much smaller bulk-viscosity/shear-viscosity ratio
(close to unity) and this feature is well reproduced by our first-principles
approach which predicts a value of the ratio in better agreement with
experimental reference data than that obtained using the empirical
Lennard-Jones potential. The computed thermal conductivity of liquid Argon is
also in good agreement with the experimental value.

<h3>Resonant noise amplification in a predator-prey model with  quasi-discrete generations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13290</a>
<br>
<i>Marios Giannakou, Bartlomiej Waclaw</i>
<br>
<br>
Predator-prey models have been shown to exhibit resonance-like behaviour, in
which random fluctuations in the number of organisms (demographic noise) are
amplified when their frequency is close to the natural oscillatory frequency of
the system. This behaviour has been traditionally studied in models with
exponentially distributed replication and death times. Here we consider a
biologically more realistic model, in which organisms replicate
quasi-synchronously such that the distribution of replication times has a
narrow maximum at some $T>0$ corresponding to the mean doubling time. We show
that when the frequency of replication $f=1/T$ is tuned to the natural
oscillatory frequency of the predator-prey model, the system exhibits
oscillations that are much stronger than in the model with Poissonian
(non-synchronous) replication and death. The effect can be explained by
resonant amplification of coloured noise generated by quasi-synchronous
replication events. To show this, we consider a single-species model with
quasi-synchronous replication. We calculate the spectrum and the amplitude of
demographic noise in this model, and use these results to obtain these
quantities for the two-species model.

<h3>Anisotropic Electron-Hole Excitation and Large Linear Dichroism in  Two-Dimensional Ferromagnet CrSBr with In-Plane Magnetization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13342" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13342</a>

The observation of magnetic ordering in atomically thin CrI$_3$ and
Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ monolayers has aroused intense interest in condensed matter
physics and material science. Studies of van de Waals two-dimensional (2D)
magnetic materials are of both fundamental importance and application interest.
In particular, exciton-enhanced magneto-optical properties revealed in CrI$_3$
and CrBr$_3$ monolayers have expanded the understanding of exciton physics in
2D materials. Unlike CrI$_3$ and CrBr$_3$ with out-of-plane magnetization,
CrSBr has an in-plane magnetic moment, therefore, providing a good opportunity
to study the magnetic linear dichroism and high order magneto-optical effects.
Here, based on many-body perturbation method within density-functional theory,
we have studied quasiparticle electronic structure, exciton, and optical
properties in CrSBr monolayer. Strongly bounded exciton has been identified
with the first bright exciton located at 1.35 eV, in good agreement with
experiment of photoluminescence (Nat. Mater. 20, 1657 (2021)). Strong contrast
in the optical absorption is found between the electric fields lying along the
in-plane two orthogonal directions. In accordance to typical and realistic
experimental setup, we show that the rotation angle of linear polarized light,
either reflected or transmitted, could be comparable with those revealed in
black phosphorene. Such a large linear dichroism arises mainly from anisotropic
in-plane crystal structure. The magnetic contribution from the off-diagonal
component of dielectric function to the linear dichroism in CrSBr is
negligible. Our findings not only have provided a deep understanding of
exciton-enhanced optical process in low-dimensional materials, but also have
shown the potential applications of CrSBr in 2D optics and optoelectronics.

<h3>Peculiar band geometry induced giant shift current in ferroelectric SnTe  monolayer</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13391" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13391</a>

<br>
<br>
The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the phenomenon of generating
photocurrent or photovoltage in homogeneous noncentrosymmetric materials under
illumination, and the intrinsic contribution to the BPVE is known as the shift
current effect. We calculate the shift current conductivities of the
ferroelectric SnTe monolayer using first-principles methods. We find that the
monolayer SnTe has giant shift-current conductivity near the valley points.
More remarkably, the linear optical absorption coefficient at this energy is
very small, and therefore leads to an enormous Glass coefficient that is four
orders of magnitude larger than that of BaTiO$_3$. The unusual shift-current
effects are further investigated using a three-band model. We find that the
giant shift current conductivities and Glass coefficient are induced by the
nontrivial energy band geometries near the valley points, where the
shift-vector diverges. This is a prominent example that the band geometry can
play essential roles in the fundamental properties of solids.

<h3>The emergence of soft-glassy mechanics in simulated foams</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13400" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13400</a>
<br>
<i>Amruthesh Thirumalaiswamy, Robert A. Riggleman, John C. Crocker</i>
<br>
<br>
Several seemingly different soft materials, including foams, cells, and many
complex fluids, exhibit remarkably similar rheological properties and
microscopic dynamics, termed soft glassy mechanics. Here, we show that such
behavior emerges from a simple model of a damped ripening foam, for
sufficiently weak damping. In particular, we observe intermittent avalanchey
dynamics, bubble super-diffusion, and power-law rheology that vary as the
damping factor is changed. In the limit of weak damping, the dynamics are
determined by the tortuous low-lying portions of the energy landscape, as
described in a recent study. For strong damping the viscous stresses cause the
system configuration to evolve along higher energy paths, washing out
small-scale tortuosity and producing motion with an increasingly ballistic
character. Using a microrheological approach, the linear viscoelastic response
of the model can be efficiently calculated. This resembles the power-law
rheology expected for soft glassy mechanics, but unexpectedly, is only weakly
sensitive to the damping parameter. Lastly, we study the reported memory effect
in foams after large perturbations and find that the timescale of the memory
goes to zero as the damping parameter vanishes, suggesting that the effect is
due to viscous stress relaxation rather than slow structural changes stabilized
by the energy landscape.

<h3>Exciton diffusion in amorphous organic semiconductors: reducing  simulation overheads with machine learning</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13435" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13435</a>

<br>

Simulations of exciton and charge hopping in amorphous organic materials
involve numerous physical parameters. Each of these parameters must be computed
from costly ab initio calculations before the simulation can commence,
resulting in a significant computational overhead for studying exciton
diffusion, especially in large and complex material datasets. While the idea of
using machine learning to quickly predict these parameters has been explored
previously, typical machine learning models require long training times which
ultimately contribute to simulation overheads. In this paper, we present a new
machine learning architecture for building predictive models for intermolecular
exciton coupling parameters. Our architecture is designed in such a way that
the total training time is reduced compared to ordinary Gaussian process
regression or kernel ridge regression models. Based on this architecture, we
build a predictive model and use it to estimate the coupling parameters which
enter into an exciton hopping simulation in amorphous pentacene. We show that
this hopping simulation is able to achieve excellent predictions for exciton
diffusion tensor elements and other properties as compared to a simulation
using coupling parameters computed entirely from density functional theory.
This result, along with the short training times afforded by our architecture,
therefore shows how machine learning can be used to reduce the high
computational overheads associated with exciton and charge diffusion
simulations in amorphous organic materials.

<h3>First passage time statistics of non-Markovian random walker: Onsager's  regression hypothesis approach</h3>

<br>

First passage time plays a fundamental role in dynamical characterization of
stochastic processes. Crucially, our current understanding on the problem is
almost entirely relies on the theoretical formulations, which assume the
processes under consideration are Markovian, despite abundant non-Markovian
dynamics found in complex systems. Here we introduce a simple and physically
appealing analytical framework to calculate the first passage time statistics
of non-Markovian walkers grounded in a fundamental principle of nonequilibrium
statistical physics that connects the fluctuations in stochastic system to the
macroscopic law of relaxation. Pinpointing a crucial role of the memory in the
first passage time statistics, our approach not only allows us to confirm the
non-trivial scaling conjectures for fractional Brownian motion, but also
provides a formula of the first passage time distribution in the entire time
scale, and establish the quantitative description of the position probability
distribution of non-Markovian walkers in the presence of absorbing boundary.

<h3>On the giant deformation and ferroelectricity of guanidinium nitrate</h3>

The extraordinary properties of materials accompanying their phase
transitions are exciting from the perspectives of scientific research and new
applications. Most recently, Karothu et al.1 described guanidinium nitrate,
[C(NH2)3]+[NO3]-, hereafter GN, as a ferroelectric semiconducting organic
crystal with exceptional actuating properties. However, the ferroelectric and
semiconducting properties of this hybrid organic-inorganic material were not
confirmed by the experimental results, and the reproducibility of the large
stroke associated with the first-order transition is questionable, because the
GN crystals are inherently susceptible to the formation of defects. Besides,
previous extensive studies on GN were not acknowledged.

<h3>Orientation-dependent electron-phonon coupling in interfacial  superconductors LaAlO3/KTaO3</h3>

<br>
<br>
The emergent superconductivity at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces exhibits a
mysterious dependence on the KTaO3 crystallographic orientations. Here we show,
by soft X-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that the interfacial
superconductivity is contributed by mobile electrons with unexpected
quasi-three-dimensional character, beyond the "two-dimensional electron gas"
scenario in describing oxide interfaces. At differently-oriented interfaces,
the quasi-three-dimensional electron gas ubiquitously exists and spatially
overlaps with the small q Fuchs-Kliewer surface phonons. Intriguingly,
electrons and the Fuchs-Kliewer phonons couple with different strengths
depending on the interfacial orientations, and the stronger coupling correlates
with the higher superconducting transition temperature. Our results provide a
natural explanation for the orientation-dependent superconductivity, and the
first evidence that interfacial orientations can affect electron-phonon
coupling strength over several nanometers, which may have profound implications
for the applications of oxide interfaces in general.

dispersion is made and it reveals that the cubic $PbGeO_{3}$ perovskite is
dynamically stable. In addition, the electronic properties of $PbGeO_{3}$ shows
an opening gap energy, meaning a semiconductor behavior with an indirect band
gap equal to $1.67 eV$. Moreover, the obtained elastic constants of cubic
$PbGeO_{3}$ satisfy Born's mechanical stability criteria, and this indicates
that our compound behaves as a stable ductile material. The
temperature-pressure effects on thermodynamic parameters are investigated using
the Gibbs$2$ package. Finally, based on the obtained results about the cubic
$PbGeO_{3}$ perovskite properties, we assume that this compound will have
potential applications.

<h3>Theoretical study of phonon-mediated superconductivity beyond  Migdal-Eliashberg approximation and Coulomb pseudopotential</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13520" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13520</a>

<br>
<br>
In previous theoretical studies of phonon-mediated superconductors, the
electron-phonon coupling is treated by solving the Migdal-Eliashberg equations
under the bare vertex approximation, whereas the effect of Coulomb repulsion is
incorporated by introducing one single pseudopotential parameter. These two
approximations become unreliable in low carrier-density superconductors in
which the vertex corrections are not small and the Coulomb interaction is
poorly screened. Here, we shall go beyond these two approximations and employ
the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach to handle the interplay of
electron-phonon interaction and Coulomb interaction in a self-consistent way.
We first derive the exact Dyson-Schwinger integral equation of the full
electron propagator. Such an equation contains several unknown single-particle
propagators and fermion-boson vertex functions, and thus seems to be
intractable. To solve this difficulty, we further derive a number of identities
satisfied by all the relevant propagators and vertex functions and then use
these identities to show that the exact Dyson-Schwinger equation of electron
propagator is actually self-closed. This self-closed equation takes into
account not only all the vertex corrections, but also the mutual influence
between electron-phonon interaction and Coulomb interaction. Solving it by
using proper numerical methods leads to the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$
and other quantities. As an application of the approach, we compute the $T_{c}$
of the interfacial superconductivity realized in the one-unit-cell
FeSe/SrTiO$_{3}$ system. We find that $T_{c}$ can be strongly influenced by the
vertex corrections and the competition between phonon-mediated attraction and
Coulomb repulsion.

As the go-to method to solve the electronic structure problem, Kohn-Sham
density functional theory (KS-DFT) can be used to obtain the ground-state
charge density, total energy, and several other key materials' properties.
Unfortunately, the solution of the Kohn-Sham equations is found iteratively.
This is a numerically intensive task, limiting the possible size and complexity
of the systems to be treated. Machine-learning (ML) models for the charge
density can then be used as surrogates to generate the converged charge density
and reduce the computational cost of solving the electronic structure problem.
We derive a powerful grid-centred structural representation based on the Jacobi
and Legendre polynomials that, combined with a linear regression built on a
data-efficient workflow, can accurately learn the charge density. Then, we
design a machine-learning pipeline that can return energy and forces at the
quality of a converged DFT calculation but at a fraction of the computational
cost. This can be used as a tool for the fast scanning of the energy landscape
and as a starting point to the DFT self-consistent cycle, in both cases
maintaining a low computational cost.

Representing field emission data on a Fowler--Nordheim plot is both very
common and strongly not recommended. It leads to a spurious estimation of the
emitter parameters despite a very good data fit. There is a lack of a reliable
method of analysis and a proper estimation of the uncertainty in the extracted
parameters. In this article, we show that the uncertainty in the estimation of
the field enhancement factor or the emission area can be as high as [Formula:
see text] even for a tungsten single emitter in good ultrahigh vacuum
conditions analyzed by the Murphy--Good model. Moreover, the choice of the
exact Murphy--Good method can have a noticeable impact. We found that advanced
analysis methods, based on the measurement of the differential conductance of
the emitter, are so demanding in terms of emitter stability that up to now its
requirements are probably out of reach in any field emission laboratory.

We carefully calculate the entropy to include all processes introducing
disorder to the system, i.e., combining the electronic, phononic, and
configuration entropies. Furthermore we present our algorithm for generating
Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS). We model the miscibility gap in tungsten
- chromium and tungsten - molybdenum systems, obtaining the agreement with the
experimental data. Furthermore, we propose an enhancement for the
tungsten-chromium W$_{70}$Cr$_{30}$ alloy with tantalum and hafnium, leading to
the modified stabilization temperatures $T_S$, where the solid solution is
miscible.

High-resolution neutron and THz spectroscopies are used to study the magnetic
excitation spectrum of Cs$_2$CoBr$_4$, a distorted-triangular-lattice
antiferromagnet with nearly XY-type anisotropy. What was previously thought of
as a broad excitation continuum [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 087201 (2022)] is shown
to be a series of dispersive bound states reminiscent of "Zeeman ladders" in
quasi-one-dimensional Ising systems. At wave vectors where inter-chain
interactions cancel at the Mean Field level, they can indeed be interpreted as
bound finite-width kinks in individual chains. Elsewhere in the Brillouin zone
their true two-dimensional structure and propagation are revealed.

<br>
<br>
Quantum dot molecules (QDMs) are one of the few quantum light sources that
promise deterministic generation of one- and two-dimensional photonic graph
states. The proposed protocols rely on coherent excitation of the
tunnel-coupled and spatially indirect exciton states. Here, we demonstrate
power-dependent Rabi oscillations of direct excitons, spatially indirect
excitons, and excitons with a hybridized electron wave function. An
off-resonant detection technique based on phonon-mediated state transfer allows
for spectrally filtered detection under resonant excitation. Applying a gate
voltage to the QDM-device enables a continuous transition between direct and
indirect excitons and, thereby, control of the overlap of the electron and hole
wave function. This does not only vary the Rabi frequency of the investigated
transition by a factor of $\approx3$, but also allows to optimize graph state
generation in terms of optical pulse power and reduction of radiative
lifetimes.

<br>
<br>
We analyze the validity of a quasiparticle description of a superconducting
state at a metallic quantum-critical point (QCP). A normal state at a QCP is a
non-Fermi liquid with no coherent quasiparticles. A superconducting order gaps
out low-energy excitations, except for a sliver of states for non-s-wave gap
symmetry, and at a first glance, should restore a coherent quasiparticle
behavior. We argue that this does not necessarily hold as in some cases the
fermionic self-energy remains singular slightly above the gap edge. This
singularity gives rise to markedly non-BCS behavior of the density of states
and to broadening and eventual vanishing of the quasiparticle peak in the
spectral function. We analyze the set of quantum-critical models with an
effective dynamical 4-fermion interaction, mediated by a gapless boson at a
QCP, $V(\Omega) \propto 1/\Omega^\gamma$. We show that coherent quasiparticle
behavior in a superconducting state holds for $\gamma <1/2$, but breaks down
for larger $\gamma$. We discuss signatures of quasiparticle breakdown and
compare our results with the data.

Investigation of charged interfaces is often limited by their complexity.
Here, we introduce the potential of monolayer charge as a new milepost in
electric double layer studies. The potential of monolayer charge signifies a
point with the simplest possible interfacial structure. We use density
functional theory calculations to predict the potential of monolayer charge for
a range of polyatomic heterohydrocarbons. The results suggest that increasing
the lateral size of the ions allows the formation of saturated monolayers at
experimentally achievable potentials. Further investigation of the potential of
monolayer charge combined with suggestions for experimental verification will
enable new developments in electric double layer studies.

<br>
Time-resolved dynamics in charge-density-wave materials have revealed
interesting out-of-equilibrium electronic responses. However these are
typically only performed in a single material possessing a CDW. As such, it is
challenging to separate subtle effects originating from the CDW. Here, we
report on the ultrafast dynamics of the GdSb$_{x}$Te$_{2-x-\delta}$ series of
materials where E$_{F}$ can be tuned, resulting in a change from an undistorted
tetraganal phase to a CDW with a wavevector that depends on $x$. Using
mid-infrared, near-infrared, and visible excitation, we find the dynamics are
sensitive to both E$_{F}$ and the presence of the CDW. Specifically, as the Sb
content of the compounds increases, transient spectral features shift to higher
probe energies. In addition, we observe an enhanced lifetime and change in the
sign of the transient signal upon removing the CDW with high Sb concentrations.
Finally, we reveal fluence- and temperature-dependent photo-induced responses
of the differential reflectivity, which provide evidence of transient charge
density wave suppression in related telluride materials. Taken together our
results provide a blueprint for future ultrafast studies of CDW systems.

<h3>Scalability of non-adiabatic effects in lithium-decorated graphene  superconductor</h3>

<i>Dominik Szczȩśniak</i>
<br>
<br>
The analysis is conducted to unveil how the non-adiabatic effects scale
within the superconducting phase of lithium-decorated graphene (LiC$_{6}$).
Based on the Eliashberg formalism it is shown that the non-adiabatic effects
notably reduce essential superconducting parameters in LiC$_{6}$ and arise as a
significant oppressor of the discussed phase. Moreover, nonadiabaticity is
found to scale with the strength of superconductivity, proportionally to the
phonon energy scale and inversely with respect to the electron-phonon coupling.
These findings are partially in contrast to other theoretical studies and show
that superconductivity in LiC$_{6}$ is more peculiar than previously
anticipated. In this context, the guidelines for enhancing superconducting
phase in LiC$_{6}$ and sibling materials are also proposed.

Helium droplets produced by the instability of a cryogenic helium jet exiting
a source chamber leads to the formation of He drops which are considered as
ideal matrices for spectroscopic studies of embedded atoms and molecules. Here,
we present a He-DFT description of droplet formation resulting from jet
breaking and contraction of superfluid He-4 filaments. Whereas the
fragmentation of long jets closely follows the predictions of linear theory for
inviscid fluids, leading to droplet trains interspersed with smaller satellite
droplets, the contraction of filaments with an aspect ratio larger than a
threshold value leads to the nucleation of vortex rings which hinder their
breakup into droplets.

<br>
<br>
In the ferromagnetic (FM) Weyl semimetal CeAlSi both space-inversion and
time-reversal symmetries are broken. Our quantum oscillation (QO) data indicate
that the FM ordering modifies the Fermi surface topology and also leads to an
unusual drop in the QO amplitude. In the FM phase, we find a pressure-induced
suppression of the anomalous and the loop Hall effects. This cannot be
explained based on the electronic band structure or magnetic structure, both of
which are nearly pressure independent. Instead, we show that a simplified model
describing the scattering of Weyl fermions off FM domain walls can potentially
explain the observed topological features. Our study highlights the importance
of domain walls for understanding transport in FM Weyl semimetals.

<h3>A numerical study of the effect of discretization methods on the crystal  plasticity finite element method</h3>

<br>
<br>
The present report describes a big data numerical study of crystal plasticity
finite element (CPFE) modelling using static and grain-based meshing to
investigate the dependence of the results on the discretization approach.
Static mesh refers to the integration point-based representation of the
microstructure in which the integration points (IPs) within a finite element
may belong to different grains, while in the grain-based meshing the minimum
discretization unit is an element that may only belong to one grain. The
crystal plasticity constitutive law was coded using UMAT subroutine within
commercial finite element software Abaqus. Multiple sets of RVEs were
investigated under strain-controlled loading and periodic boundary conditions.
The stress and strain contour maps obtained from RVEs with static mesh and
grain-based mesh were compared. The simulation results reveal that both
discretization methods provide reliable predictions of the stress-strain curves
and the stress/strain localization points in polycrystalline alloys. Static
mesh tends to smooth the stress/strain profile at the grain boundary, whilst
stress/strain discontinuities are present in the grain-based mesh results. The
above findings remain valid when the number of grains within an RVE increases
from 34 to 1250. To quantify the difference between static and grain-based
meshing, a relative measure of deviation is defined. The deviations of global
stress were found to be relatively small, within 0.5%, while local deviations
were significant up to 50%. Static mesh has the advantage of reducing both the
preprocessing procedures and computational time compared to grain-based mesh.
It is concluded that static mesh is preferred when investigating the material's
macroscopic behaviour, whilst grain-based mesh is recommended for the study of
the local response using CPFEM.

<br>
<br>
Giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and magneto-optical activity can emerge in
magnets with topologically non-trivial degeneracies. However, identifying the
specific band structure features like Weyl points, nodal lines or planes which
generate the anomalous response is a challenging issue. Since the low-energy
interband transitions can govern the static AHE, we addressed this question in
the prototypical magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ also hosting nodal
lines by broadband polarized reflectivity and magneto-optical Kerr effect
spectroscopy with a focus on the far-infrared range. In the linear dichroism
spectrum we observe a strong resonance at 40\,meV, which also shows up in the
optical Hall conductivity spectrum and primarily determines the static AHE,
thus, confirms its intrinsic origin. Our material-specific theory reproduces
the experimental data remarkably well and shows that strongly tilted nodal line
segments around the Fermi energy generate the resonance. While the Weyl points
only give vanishing contributions, these segments of the nodal lines gapped by
the spin-orbit coupling dominate the low-energy optical response.

<br>
<br>
We study the bi-dimensional $q$-Potts model with long-range bond correlated
disorder. Similarly to [C. Chatelain, Phys. Rev. E 89, 032105], we implement a
disorder bimodal distribution by coupling the Potts model to auxiliary
spin-variables, which are correlated with a power-law decaying function. The
universal behaviour of different observables, especially the thermal and the
order-parameter critical exponents, are computed by Monte-Carlo techniques for
$q=1,2,3$-Potts models for different values of the power-law decaying exponent
$a$. On the basis of our conclusions, which are in agreement with previous
theoretical and numerical results for $q=1$ and $q=2$, we can conjecture the
phase diagram for $q\in [1,4]$. In particular, we establish that the system is
driven to a fixed point at finite or infinite long-range disorder depending on
the values of $q$ and $a$. Finally, we discuss the role of the higher cumulants
of the disorder distribution. This is done by drawning the auxiliary
spin-variables from different statistical models. While the main features of
the phase diagram depend only on the first and second cumulant, we argue, for
the infinite disorder fixed point, that certain universal effects are affected
by the higher cumulants of the disorder distribution.

<br>

<br>
<br>
In bulk superconductors or Josephson junctions formed in materials with
spin-orbit interaction, the critical current can depend on the direction of
current flow and applied magnetic field, an effect known as the superconducting
(SC) diode effect. Here, we consider the SC diode effect in Josephson junctions
in nanowire devices. We find that the $4\pi$-periodic contribution of Majorana
bound states (MBSs) to the current phase relation (CPR) of single junctions
results in a significant enhancement of the SC diode effect when the device
enters the topological phase. Crucially, this enhancement of the SC diode
effect is independent of the parity of the junction and therefore protected
from parity altering events, such as quasiparticle poisoning, which have
hampered efforts to directly observe the $4\pi$-periodic CPR of MBSs. We show
that this effect can be generalized to SQUIDs and that, in such devices, the
parity-protected SC diode effect can provide a highly controllable probe of the
topology in a Josephson junction.

<br>
Carrier relaxation measurements in moir\'e materials offer a unique probe of
the microscopic interactions, in particular the ones that are not easily
measured by transport. Umklapp scattering between phonons is a ubiquitous
momentum-nonconserving process that governs the thermal conductivity of
semiconductors and insulators. In contrast, Umklapp scattering between
electrons and phonons has not been demonstrated experimentally. Here, we study
the cooling of hot electrons in moir\'e graphene using time- and
frequency-resolved photovoltage measurements as a direct probe of its complex
energy pathways including electron-phonon coupling. We report on a dramatic
speedup in hot carrier cooling of twisted bilayer graphene near the magic
angle: the cooling time is a few picoseconds from room temperature down to 5 K,
whereas in pristine graphene coupling to acoustic phonons takes nanoseconds.
Our analysis indicates that this ultrafast cooling is a combined effect of the
formation of a superlattice with low-energy moir\'e phonons, spatially
compressed electronic Wannier orbitals, and a reduced superlattice Brillouin
zone, enabling Umklapp scattering that overcomes electron-phonon momentum
mismatch. These results demonstrate a way to engineer electron-phonon coupling
in twistronic systems, an approach that could contribute to the fundamental
understanding of their transport properties and enable applications in thermal
management and ultrafast photodetection.

<br>
<br>
We perform physical and numerical experiments to study the stick-slip
response of a stack of slabs in contact through dry frictional interfaces
driven in quasistatic shear. The ratio between the drive's stiffness and the
slab's shear stiffness controls the presence or absence of slip
synchronization. A sufficiently high stiffness ratio leads to full
synchronization, comprising periodic slip events in which all interfaces slip
simultaneously. A lower stiffness ratio leads to asynchronous slips and,
experimentally, to the stick-slip amplitude being broadly distributed as the
number of layers in the stack increases. We interpret this broadening in light
of the combined effect of surface disorder, complex loading paths of the
asynchronous slips, and creep. The extracted aging rate is found to be of the
same order of magnitude as existing experimental results on a similar material.
Finally, we discuss the emergence of slow slips and an increase in creep-rate
variations when more slabs are added to the stack.

Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds with the underlying
interplay of nontrivial band topology and magnetic spin configuration.
Extensive interests have been aroused due to their application potential
involved with an array of exotic quantum states. With angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, here we study the
electronic properties of two magnetic Weyl semimetal candidates PrAlSi and
SmAlSi. Though the two compounds harbor distinct magnetic ground states
(ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic for PrAlSi and SmAlSi, respectively) and
4$f$ shell fillings, we find that they share quite analogous low-energy band
structure. By the measurements across the magnetic transitions, we further
reveal that there is no evident evolution of the band structure in both
compounds and the experimental spectra can be well reproduced by the
nonmagnetic calculations, together suggesting a negligible effect of the
magnetism on their electronic structures and a possibly weak coupling between
the localized 4$f$ electrons and the itinerant conduction electrons. Our
results offer essential insights into the interactions between magnetism,
electron correlations, and topological orders in the $R$Al$X$ ($R$ = light rare
earth and $X$ = Si or Ge) family.

Super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely explored as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents because of a combination of favorable
magnetic properties, biocompability and ease of fabrication. MRI using
traditional T1- or T2-weighted single mode contrast-enhanced techniques may

contrast agent based on the super-paramagnetic zinc-manganese ferrite
(Zn$_{0.3}$Mn$_x$Fe$_{2.7-x}$O$_4$, x= 0, 0.25, 0.75 and 1) NPs with small core
size and a hydrophilic PEG surface coating is reported. The TEM, TGA and FTIR
results confirmed the formation of a uniform coating on the NPs surface. The
MRI analysis revealed that the Zn$_{0.3}$Mn$_{0.5}$Fe$_{2.2}$O$_4$ NPs had the
maximum image contrast compared to other zinc-manganese ferrite samples. Cell
viability evaluations revealed that the coated and uncoated particles did not
inhibit cell growth pattern. The present PEG-coated

Two-band electronic structures with a valence and a conduction band separated

coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves in connection with
underdoped cuprates and transition metal dichalcogenides. By using a mean-field
approach to study the system above mentioned, we have obtained numerical
results for superconducting gaps, chemical potential, condensate fractions,
coherence lengths, and superconducting mean-field critical temperature,
considering a tunable band gap and different filling of the conduction band,
for parametric choice of the pairing interactions. By tuning these quantities,
the electrons redistribute among valence and conduction band in a complex way,
leading to a new physics with respect to single-band superconductors, such as
density induced and band-selective BCS-BEC crossover, quantum phase
transitions, and hidden criticalities. At finite temperature, this phenomenon
is also responsible for the non-monotonic behavior of the superconducting gaps
resulting in a superconducting-normal state reentrant transition, without the
need of disorder or magnetic effects.

A dry frictional interface loaded in shear often displays stick-slip. The
amplitude of this cycle depends on the probability that a slip event nucleates
into a rupture, and on the rate at which slip events are triggered. This rate
is determined by the distribution $P(x)$ of soft spots which yields if the
shear stress is increased by some amount $x$. In minimal models of a frictional
interface that include disorder, inertia and long-range elasticity, we
discovered an 'armouring' mechanism, by which the interface is greatly
stabilised after a large slip event: $P(x)$ then vanishes at small arguments,
as $P(x)\sim x^\theta$ [1]. The exponent $\theta>0$, which exists only in the
presence of inertia (otherwise $\theta=0$), was found to depend on the
statistics of the disorder in the model, a phenomenon that was not explained.
Here, we show that a single-particle toy model with inertia and disorder
captures the existence of a non-trivial exponent $\theta>0$, which we can
analytically relate to the statistics of the disorder.

Creating a good contact between electrodes and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)
has been a longstanding challenge in searching for the next GNR-based
nanoelectronics. This quest requires the controlled fabrication of sub-20 nm
metallic gaps, a clean GNR transfer minimizing damage and organic contamination
during the device fabrication, as well as work function matching to minimize
the contact resistance. Here, we transfer 9-atom-wide armchair-edged GNRs
(9-AGNRs) grown on Au(111)/mica substrates to pre-patterned platinum
electrodes, yielding polymer-free 9-AGNR field-effect transistor devices. Our
devices have a resistance in the range of $10^6$ to $10^8$ $\Omega$ in the
low-bias regime, which is 2 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than previous
reports. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with the
non-equilibrium Green's function method (NEGF) explain the observed p-type
electrical characteristics and further demonstrate that platinum gives strong
coupling and higher transmission in comparison to other materials such as
graphene.

We investigate finite temperature spin transport in one spatial dimension by
considering the spin-spin correlation function of the Hubbard model in the
limiting case of infinitely strong repulsion. We find that in the absence of
bias the transport is diffusive, and derive the spin diffusion constant. Our
approach is based on asymptotic analysis of a Fredholm determinant
representation, which is entirely analytic and free of phenomenological
assumptions of Generalized Hydrodynamics.

<h3>Spontaneous square vs. hexagonal nanoscale skyrmion lattices in  Fe/Ir(111)</h3>

We study the emergence of spontaneous skyrmion lattices in an Fe monolayer in
fcc and hcp stacking on the Ir(111) surface using density functional theory
(DFT). For fcc-Fe/Ir(111) we find the well-known square nanoskyrmion lattice.
However, for hcp-Fe/Ir(111) the hexagonal skyrmion lattice previously proposed
based on experiments is energetically unfavorable with respect to a hexagonal
multi-Q state with nearly collinear magnetic moments. By mapping our DFT
calculations to an atomistic spin model we demonstrate that the interplay of
pair-wise exchange, higher-order exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction is decisive for the symmetry and collinearity of the obtained spin
lattice.

Lattice symmetries are central to the characterization of electronic
topology. Recently, it was shown that Green's function eigenvectors form a
representation of the space group. This formulation has allowed the
identification of gapless topological states even when quasiparticles are
absent. Here we demonstrate the profundity of the framework in the extreme
case, when interactions lead to a Mott insulator, through a solvable model with
long-range interactions. We find that both Mott poles and zeros are subject to
the symmetry constraints, and relate the symmetry-enforced spectral crossings
to degeneracies of the original non-interacting eigenstates. Our results lead
to new understandings of topological quantum materials and highlight the
utility of interacting Green's functions toward their symmetry-based design.
