<h3>Random singlet-like phase of disordered Hubbard chains</h3>

Local moment formation is ubiquitous in disordered semiconductors such as
Si:P, where it is observed both in the metallic and the insulating regimes.
Here, we focus on local moment behavior in disordered insulators, which arises
from short-ranged, repulsive electron-electron interactions. Using density
matrix renormalization group and strong-disorder renormalization group methods,
we study paradigmatic models of interacting insulators: one dimensional Hubbard
chains with quenched randomness. In chains with either random fermion hoppings
or random chemical potentials, both at and away from half-filling, we find
exponential decay of charge and fermion 2-point correlations but power-law
decay of spin correlations that are indicative of the random singlet phase. The
numerical results can be understood qualitatively by appealing to the
large-interaction limit of the Hubbard chain, in which a remarkably simple
picture emerges.

<h3>Hall anomaly by vacancies in pinned lattice of vortices: A quantitative analysis on the thin-film data of BSCCO</h3>

Hall anomaly, as appears in the mixed-state Hall resistivity of type-II
superconductors, has had numerous theories but yet a consensus on its origin.
In this work, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the magnetotransport
measurements on BSCCO thin films by Zhao et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 247001
(2019)] and validate a previously proposed vacancy mechanism [cf. J. Phys.
Condens. Matter. 10, L677 (1998)] with many-body vortex correlations for the
phenomenon. The model attributes the Hall anomaly to the motion of vacancies in
pinned fragments of vortex lattice. Its validity is first examined by an
exploration on the vortex states near the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the
vortex crystal. Comparisons are then carried out between the measured
activation energies with the calculated creation energy of the
vortex-anti-vortex pair and the vacancy energy on the flux-line lattice, with
no adjustable parameter. Our analysis elucidates the theoretical basis and
prerequisites of the vacancy model. In particular, the vacancy activation
energies are an order of magnitude smaller than that of a sole vortex line. The
proposed mechanism may provide a macro-theoretical framework for other studies.
