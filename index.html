<h3>A minimal model for liquid-liquid phase separation and aging of  chemically reactive macromolecular mixtures</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06217" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06217</a>

Mixtures of several macromolecular species can lead to the formation of
higher-order structures that often display non-ideal mixing behavior. In this
work, we propose a minimal model of a quaternary system which considers the
formation of a complex via a chemical reaction involving two macromolecular
species; the complex may then phase separate from the buffer and undergo a
further transition into a gel-like state over time. First, a ternary phase
diagram that captures the volume fraction of each species and phases at
equilibrium is constructed. Specifically, we investigate how physical
parameters such as stoichiometric coefficients, molecular sizes and interaction
parameters affect LLPS and aging. Finally, we analyze the thermodynamic
stability of the two-phase system and identify the spinodal regions, and
outline the generalization of our approach to reactive biomolecular systems
with an arbitrary number of components.

<h3>Spin, charge and $η$-spin separation in one-dimensional photo-doped  Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06263" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06263</a>

<br>
<br>
We show that effectively cold metastable states in one-dimensional
photo-doped Mott insulators described by the extended Hubbard model exhibit
spin, charge and $\eta$-spin separation. Namely, their wave functions in the
large on-site Coulomb interaction limit can be expressed as $|\Psi\rangle
=|\Psi_{\rm charge}\rangle|\Psi_{\rm spin}\rangle |\Psi_{\rm
\eta-spin}\rangle$, which is analogous to the Ogata-Shiba states of the doped
Hubbard model in equilibrium. Here $\eta$-spin represents the type of the
photo-generated pseudeparticles (doublon or holon). $|\Psi_{\rm charge}\rangle$
is determined by spinless free fermions, $|\Psi_{\rm spin}\rangle$ by the
isotropic Heisenberg model in the squeezed spin space, and $|\Psi_{\rm
\eta-spin}\rangle$ by the XXZ model in the squeezed $\eta$-spin space.In
particular, the metastable $\eta$-pairing and charge-density-wave (CDW) states
correspond to the gapless and gapful states of the XXZ model. The specific form
of the wave function allows us to accurately determine the exponents of
correlation functions. The form also suggests that the central charge of the
$\eta$-pairing state is 3 and that of the CDW phase is 2, which we numerically
confirm. Our study provides analytic and intuitive insights into the
correlations between active degrees of freedom in photo-doped strongly
correlated systems.

<h3>Structure, heat capacity and Raman spectra of mm-sized  Ba$_{2}$MgWO$_{6}$ single crystals synthesized by BaCl$_{2}$-MgCl$_{2}$ flux  method</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a new method of Ba$_{2}$MgWO$_{6}$ single crystal synthesis that
allows to grow larger crystals using BaCl$_{2}$ and MgCl$_{2}$ flux.
Difficulties to grow single crystal of a size suitable for macroscopic material
property measurements caused the majority of characterisation being published
on polycrystalline samples. Single crystal diffraction and energy dispersive
X-ray analysis confirmed high quality of synthesised samples. Heat capacity
measurements from 300~K to 2~K do not show any transitions. However, Raman
spectra measured down to 77~K contain additional peaks at all temperatures
probed, which is in a contrast with only 4 Raman active modes expected from the
reducible representation. This calls for a more detailed study of potential
symmetry breaking that could also influence the electronic properties of the
material.

<h3>Logarithmic wave-mechanical effects in polycrystalline metals: Theory  and experiment</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06407" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06407</a>

<br>
<br>
Schrodinger-type wave equations with logarithmic nonlinearity occur in
hydrodynamic models of Korteweg-type materials with capillarity and surface
tension, which can undergo liquid-solid or liquid-gas phase transitions. One of
the predictions of the theory is a periodic pattern of density inhomogeneities
occurring in the form of either bubbles (topological phase), or cells
(non-topological phase). Such inhomogeneities are described by solitonic
solutions of a logarithmic wave equation, gaussons and kinks, in the vicinity
of the liquid-solid phase transition. During the solidification process, these
inhomogeneities become centers of nucleation, thus shaping the polycrystalline
structure of the metal grains. The theory predicts a Gaussian profile of
material density inside such a cell, which should manifest in a Gaussian-like
profile of microhardness inside a grain. We report experimental evidence of
large-scale periodicity in the structure of grains in the ferrite steel
S235/A570, copper C-Cu/C14200, austenite in steel X10CrNiTi18-10/AISI 321, and
aluminium-magnesium alloy 5083/5056; and also Gaussian-like profiles of
microhardness inside an averaged grain in these materials.

Via computer simulations we study evolution dynamics in systems of
continuously moving Active Brownian Particles. The obtained results are
discussed against those from the passive 2D Ising case. Following sudden
quenches of uniform configurations to state points lying within the miscibility
gaps and to the critical points, we investigate the far-from-steady-state
dynamics by calculating quantities associated with structure and characteristic
length scales. We also study aging for quenches into the miscibility gap and
provide a quantitative picture for the scaling behavior of the two-time
order-parameter correlation function. The overall structure and dynamics are
consistent with expectations from the Ising model. This remains true for
certain active lattice models as well for which we present results for quenches
to the critical points.

<h3>Intermolecular interaction enhances thermoelectric performance of  molecular junctions</h3>

Novel organic materials formed from functional molecules are attractive for
various nanoelectronic applications because they are environmentally friendly,
widely available and inexpensive. Recent advancement in bottom-up fabrication
methods has made it possible to design and synthesis functional molecules with
desired functionalities and engineer their properties precisely. This requires
deeper understanding of if the properties of building blocks e.g. single
molecules can be translated to many molecule junctions in the form of
self-assembled monolayers (SAM). Therefore, understanding the effect of
intermolecular interaction becomes important. In this paper, we study the
effect of intermolecular interactions on the charge transport and
thermoelectric properties of junctions formed by parallel molecules between
metallic electrodes. We demonstrate that the electrical conductance and Seebeck
coefficient are enhanced simultaneously leading to more than an order of
magnitude enhancement of power factor as a result of intermolecular coupling
between two molecules of the same kind or different. This strategy can be used
to improve the thermoelectric performance of SAMs by engineering their packing
density.

<h3>Density anomaly in water-alcohol mixtures: minimum model for structure  makers and breakers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06578" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06578</a>

We modeled the change in the temperature of maximum density (TMD) of a
water-like solvent when small amounts of solute are added to the mixture. The
solvent is modeled as a two length scales potential, which is known to exhibit
water-like characteristic anomalies, while the solute is chosen to have an
attractive interaction with the solvent which is tuned from small to large
attractive potential. We show that if the solute exhibits high attraction with
the solvent it behaves as a structure maker and the TMD increases with the
addition of solute, while if the solute shows a low attraction with the solvent
the TMD decreases, with the solute behaving as a structure breaker.

<h3>Control of Active Brownian Particles: An exact solution</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06651" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06651</a>
<br>

<br>
Control of stochastic systems is a challenging open problem in statistical
physics, with potential applications in a wealth of systems from biology to
granulates. Unlike most cases investigated so far, we aim here at controlling a
genuinely out-of-equilibrium system, the two dimensional Active Brownian
Particles model in a harmonic potential, a paradigm for the study of
self-propelled bacteria. We search for protocols for the driving parameters
(stiffness of the potential and activity of the particles) bringing the system
from an initial passive-like stationary state to a final active-like one,
within a chosen time interval. The exact analytical results found for this
prototypical system of self-propelled particles brings control techniques to a
wider class of out-of-equilibrium systems.

<h3>Comment on "Harvesting information to control non-equilibrium states of  active matter"</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06825" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06825</a>
<br>
<i>Antoine Bérut</i>
<br>
<br>
In the article Phys. Rev. E 106, 054617 "Harvesting information to control
non-equilibrium states of active matter", the authors study the transition from
one non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) to another NESS by changing the
correlated noise that is driving a Brownian particle held in an optical trap.
They find that the amount of heat that is released during the transition is
directly proportional to the difference of spectral entropy between the two
colored noises, in a fashion that is reminiscent of Landauer's principle. In
this comment I argue that the found relation between the released heat and the
spectral entropy does not hold in general, as one can provide examples of
noises where it clearly fails. I also show that, even in the case considered by
the authors, the relation is not rigorously true and is only approximately
verified experimentally.

<h3>Impedance responses and size-dependent resonances in topolectrical  circuits via the method of images</h3>

Resonances in an electric circuit occur when capacitive and inductive
components are present together. Such resonances appear in admittance
measurements depending on the circuit's parameters and the driving AC
frequency. In this study, we analyze the impedance characteristics of
nontrivial topolectrical circuits (TEs) such as 1D and 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
(SSH) circuits and reveal that size-dependent anomalous impedance resonances
inevitably arise in finite $LC$ circuits. Through the method of images, we
study how resonance modes in a multi-dimensional circuit array can be
nontrivially modified by the reflection and interference of current from the
structure and boundaries of the lattice. We derive analytic expressions for the
impedance across two corner nodes of various lattice networks with homogeneous
and heterogeneous circuit elements. We also derive the irregular dependency of
the impedance resonance on the lattice size, and provide integral and
dimensionally-reduced expressions for the impedance in three dimensions and
above.

<h3>Pair density wave characterized by a hidden string order parameter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06170" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06170</a>

A composite pairing structure of superconducting state is revealed by density
matrix renormalization group study in a two-leg $t$-$J$ model. The pairing
order parameter is composed of a pairing amplitude and a phase factor, in which
the latter explicitly depends on the spin background with an analytic form
identified in the anisotropic limit as the interchain hopping integral
$t_{\perp}\rightarrow 0$. Such a string-like phase factor is responsible for a
pair density wave (PDW) induced by spin polarization with a wavevector
$Q_{\mathrm {PDW}}=2\pi m$ ($m$ the magnetization). By contrast, the pairing
amplitude remains smooth, unchanged by the PDW. In particular, a local spin
polarization can give rise to a sign change of the order parameter across the
local defect. Unlike in an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, the nonlocal
phase factor here plays a role as the new order parameter characterizing the
PDW, whose origin can be traced back to the essential sign structure of the
doped Mott insulator.

Abrikosov Vortices have long been considered as means to encode classical
information in low-temperature logic circuits (1) and memory devices (2-4).
Although it is possible to control individual vortices using local probes
(5-11), scalability towards the control of of multiple vortices remains
challenging. Vortex logic devices require means to shuttle selected vortices
reliably over long distances between engineered pinning potentials.
Concomitantly, all other vortices should remains fixed to their precise
locations. Here we demonstrate such capabilities using Nb loops patterned below
a NbSe$_2$ layer. SQUID-on-Tip (SOT) microscopy reveals that the loops can
position vortices in sites designated to a precision better than 100 nm; they
can realize "push" and "pull" operations of vortices as far as 3$\mu$m.
Successive application of such operations shuttles a vortex between adjacent
loops. Our results may be used as means to integrate vortices in future quantum
circuitry. Strikingly, we are able to demonstrate a winding operation. Such
winding, if realized in topological superconductors, is considered an essential
part of future topological quantum information processing (12-17).

<h3>Nonequilibrium Full Counting Statistics and Symmetry-Resolved  Entanglement from Space-Time Duality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06188" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06188</a>

<br>
<br>
Due to its probabilistic nature, a measurement process in quantum mechanics
produces a distribution of possible outcomes. This distribution - or its
Fourier transform known as full counting statistics (FCS) - contains much more
information than say the mean value of the measured observable and accessing it
is sometimes the only way to obtain relevant information about the system. In
fact, the FCS is the limit of an even more general family of observables - the
charged moments - that characterise how quantum entanglement is split in
different symmetry sectors in the presence of a global symmetry. Here we
consider the evolution of the FCS and of the charged moments of a U (1) charge
truncated to a finite region after a global quantum quench. For large scales
these quantities take a simple large-deviation form, showing two different
regimes as functions of time: while for times much larger than the size of the
region they approach a stationary value set by the local equilibrium state, for
times shorter than region size they show a non-trivial dependence on time. We
show that, whenever the initial state is also U (1) symmetric, the leading
order in time of FCS and charged moments in the out-of-equilibrium regime can
be determined by means of a space-time duality. Namely, it coincides with the
stationary value in the system where the roles of time and space are exchanged.
We use this observation to find some general properties of FCS and charged
moments out-of-equilibrium, and to derive an exact expression for these
quantities in interacting integrable models. We test this expression against
exact results in the Rule 54 quantum cellular automaton and exact numerics in
the XXZ spin-1/2 chain.

<h3>IrF4: From Tetrahedral Compass Model to Topological Semimetal</h3>

The intersection of topology, symmetry, and magnetism yields a rich structure
of possible phases. In this work, we study theoretically the consequences of
magnetism on IrF4, which was recently identified as a possible candidate
topological nodal chain semimetal in the absence of magnetic order. We show
that the spin-orbital nature of the Ir moments gives rise to strongly
anisotropic magnetic couplings resembling a tetrahedral compass model on a
diamond lattice. The predicted magnetic ground state preserves key symmetries
protecting the nodal lines, such that they persist into the ordered phase at
the mean-field level. The consequences for other symmetry reductions are also
discussed.

<h3>Unconventional localization of electrons inside of a nematic electronic  phase</h3>

<br>
<br>
The magnetotransport behaviour inside the nematic phase of bulk FeSe reveals
unusual multiband effects that cannot be reconciled with a simple two-band
approximation proposed by surface-sensitive spectroscopic probes. In order to
understand the role played by the multiband electronic structure and the degree
of two-dimensionality we have investigated the electronic properties of
exfoliated flakes of FeSe by reducing their thickness. Based on
magnetotransport and Hall resistivity measurements, we assess the mobility
spectrum that suggests an unusual asymmetry between the mobilities of the
electrons and holes with the electron carriers becoming localized inside the
nematic phase. Quantum oscillations in magnetic fields up to 38 T indicate the
presence of a hole-like quasiparticle with a lighter effective mass and a
quantum scattering time three times shorter, as compared with bulk FeSe. The
observed localization of negative charge carriers by reducing dimensionality
can be driven by orbitally-dependent correlation effects, enhanced interband
spin-fluctuations or a Lifshitz-like transition which affect mainly the
electron bands. The electronic localization leads to a fragile two-dimensional
superconductivity in thin flakes of FeSe, in contrast to the two-dimensional
high-Tc induced with electron doping via dosing or using a suitable interface.

One key challenge in the field of topological superconductivity (Tsc) has
been the rareness of material realization. This is true not only for the
first-order Tsc featuring Majorana surface modes, but also the higher-order
Tsc, which host Majorana hinge and corner modes. In this work, we first propose
a general material-searching "recipe" for higher-order Tsc with Majorana corner
modes. This recipe is obtained from a set of symmetry indicators that can
diagnose Majorana boundary patterns in centrosymmetric superconductors. We
derive these indicators by establishing the bulk-boundary correspondence
through a real- and momentum-space basis matching procedure. Following this
recipe, we propose that centrosymmetric MoTe$_2$, which was found
superconducting experimentally, is a higher-order Tsc. By performing ab initio
calculation and mean-field analysis for a realistic 44-band tight-binding
model, we find that centrosymmetric MoTe$_2$ could host Majorana corner and
hinge modes. Our recipe and proposed material candidate could provide general
guiding principle for material searching and designing of higher-order Tsc and
mobilize experimental effort in higher-order Tsc.

<h3>Frenetic steering in a nonequilibrium graph</h3>

Starting from a randomly-oriented complete graph, an algorithm constructs
equally-sized basins of attraction for a selection of vertices representing
patterns. For a given driving amplitude, a random walker preferentially follows
the orientation, while the nondissipative activity is considered variable. A
learning algorithm updates the time-symmetric factor in the transition rates,
in order that the walker will quickly reach a pattern and remain there for a
sufficiently long time, whenever starting from a vertex in its basin of
attraction. No use is made of a potential or cost function where patterns would
correspond to local minima, but the nonequilibrium features of the walk are
essential for frenetic steering.

<h3>Strong Room-Temperature Bulk Nonlinear Hall Effect in a Spin-Valley  Locked Dirac Material</h3>

<br>
<br>
Nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) is a new type of Hall effect with wide
application prospects. Practical device applications require strong NLHE at
room temperature (RT). However, previously reported NLHEs are all
low-temperature phenomena except for the surface NLHE of TaIrTe4. Bulk RT NLHE
is highly desired due to its ability to generate large photocurrent. Here, we
show the spin-valley locked Dirac state in BaMnSb2 can generate a strong bulk
NLHE at RT. In the microscale devices, we observe the typical signature of an
intrinsic NLHE, i.e. the transverse Hall voltage quadratically scales with the
longitudinal current as the current is applied to the Berry curvature dipole
direction. Furthermore, we also demonstrate our nonlinear Hall device's
functionality in wireless microwave detection and frequency doubling. These
findings broaden the coupled spin and valley physics from 2D systems into a 3D
system and lay a foundation for exploring bulk NLHE's applications.

Digital data for the temperature dependence of electrical resistance, which
were extracted and analyzed by Hamlin (arXiv:2210.10766v1) from the pdf file
published for "Room temperature superconductivity in a carbonaceous sulfur
hydride," show asymmetric serrations in data for 267 GPa in zero magnetic field
that comprise smooth and digitized parts. Further analysis shows that the
smooth part exhibits a step at the transition of ~16% in magnitude relative to
the data. Notably, there is no evidence of asymmetric serrations in extracted
data for lower pressures (184-258 GPa) or for 267 GPa in an applied magnetic
field (1-9 T). Several questions are raised, the answers to which would help
toward resolving these outstanding issues.

<h3>Possible routes to superconductivity in the surface layers of V-doped  Mg$_{1-δ}$Ti$_2$O$_4$ through multiple charge transfers and suppression  of Jahn-Teller activity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06245" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06245</a>

<br>
<br>
Superconductivity in the family of spinel oxides is very rare owing to their
robust Mott-insulating nature. About half a century ago, LiTi$_2$O$_4$ became
the first reported spinel compound to show superconductivity with a 12K
transition temperature. Since then, several unsuccessful attempts were made to
enhance the T$_c$ of this family of materials. However, a very recent
experiment [arXiv:2209.02053] has reported superconductivity at a higher
temperature (below 16K), in the V-doped Mg$_{1-\delta}$Ti$_2$O$_4$ thin surface
layer while its bulk counterpart remains Mott insulating. The superconducting
T$_c$ of this material is significantly higher compared to other engineered
MgTi$_2$O$_4$ thin films grown on different substrates. From our
first-principles analysis, we have identified that Mg-depletion significantly
reduces Jahn-Teller (JT) activity and antiferromagnetic superexchange at the
surface layer of V-doped MgTi$_2$O$_4$ due to considerable charge transfer
between various ions. The combined effect of a degraded antiferromagnetic order
and reduced JT activity weakens the Mottness of the system, leading to the
emergence of superconductivity at higher temperatures.

Recent advances in two-dimensional (2D) magnetism have heightened interest in
layered magnetic materials due to their potential for spintronics. In
particular, layered semiconducting antiferromagnets exhibit intriguing
low-dimensional semiconducting behavior with both charge and spin as carrier
controls. However, synthesis of these compounds is challenging and remains
rare. Here, we conducted firstprinciples based high-throughput search to screen
potentially stable mixed metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MM'P2X6, where M
and M' are transition metals and X is a chalcogenide) that have a wide range of
tunable bandgaps and interesting magnetic properties. Among the potential
candidates, we successfully synthesized a stable semiconducting layered
magnetic material, CdFeP2Se6, that exhibits a short-range antiferromagnetic
order at TN = 21 K with an indirect band gap of 2.23 eV. Our work suggests that
highthroughput screening assisted synthesis be an effective method for layered
magnetic materials discovery.

lead to unexpected electronic behavior, such as superconductivity or Mottness.
Most investigated moir\'e heterostructures are based on van der Waals (vdW)
materials, as strong interface interactions typically lead to the formation of
strained films or regular surface reconstructions. Here we successfully
synthesize ultrathin Sb films, that are predicted to show thickness-dependent
topological properties, on semi-insulating InSb(111)A. Despite the covalent
nature of the substrate surface, we prove by scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) that already the first layer of Sb atoms grows completely
unstrained, while azimuthally aligned. Rather than compensating the lattice
mismatch of -6.4% by structural modifications, the Sb films form a pronounced
moir\'e pattern as we evidence by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
topography up to film thicknesses of several bilayers. Our model calculations
based on density functional theory (DFT) assign the moir\'e pattern to a
periodic surface corrugation. In agreement with DFT predictions, irrespective
of the moir\'e modulation, the topological surface state known on thick Sb film
is experimentally confirmed to persist down to low film thicknesses, and the
Dirac point shifts towards lower binding energies with decreasing Sb thickness.

Markovian open quantum systems display complicated relaxation dynamics. The
spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic decay rate towards
the steady state, but it does not necessarily give a correct estimate of the
relaxation time because the crossover time to the asymptotic regime may be too
long. We here give a rigorous upper bound on the transient decay of
auto-correlation functions in the steady state by introducing the symmetrized
Liouvillian gap. The standard Liouvillian gap and the symmetrized one are
identical in an equilibrium situation but differ from each other in the absence
of the detailed balance condition. It is numerically shown that the symmetrized
Liouvillian gap always give a correct upper bound on the decay of the
auto-correlation function, but the standard Liouvillian gap does not.

<br>
Single-molecule photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) reveals the nature of exciton-phonon interactions in NCs.
Understanding the narrow line shapes at low temperatures and the significant
broadening as temperature increases remains an open problem. Here, we develop
an atomistic model to describe the PL spectrum of NCs, accounting for excitonic
effects, phonon dispersion relations, and exciton-phonon couplings. We use
single-molecule PL measurements on CdSe/CdS core-shell NCs from T=4 to T=290K
to validate our model and find that the slightly-asymmetric main peak at low
temperatures is comprised of a narrow zero-phonon line (ZPL) and several
acoustic phonon sidebands. Furthermore, we identify the distinct CdSe optical
modes that give rise to the optical phonon sidebands. As the temperature
increases, the spectral width shows a stronger dependence on temperature, which
we demonstrated to be correlated with frequency shifts and mode-mixing,
reflected as higher-order exciton-phonon couplings (Duschinsky rotations). We
also model the PL dependence on core size and shell thickness and provide
strategies for the design of NCs with narrow linewidths at elevated
temperatures.

<h3>Tunnelling theory of Weyl semimetals in proximity to a metallic band</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06329" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06329</a>
<br>
<i>L. Goutte, T. Pereg-Barnea</i>
<br>
<br>
We study the effects of tunnelling on the band structure and Fermi arc of a
time-reversal broken Weyl semimetal (WSM). When coupled to a non-magnetic
parabolic band, the WSM's chiral arc state lowers in energy and forms, together
with a previously extended state, a noticeable spin-dependent asymmetry in the
interface spectrum in the vicinity of the Weyl nodes. We study these effects
with a lattice model which we solve numerically on a finite sample and
analytically through using an ansatz on an infinite sample. Our ansatz agrees
very well with the numerical simulation as it accurately describes the
behaviour of the chiral state, from its energy asymmetry to the spin canting at
the interface. We find that the tunnelling effectively increases the Fermi arc
length, allowing for the presence of interface states beyond the bare Weyl
nodes. These additional states may carry current along the interface and their
contribution can be detected in the conductance. Across the interface, the
spin-independent conductance reproduces the results of an electron tunnelling
experiment to reveal the WSM's density of states. Besides conductivity, the
effect of tunnelling between the WSM and the metallic band can be seen in
quantum oscillations experiments which we briefly comment about.

<br>
<br>
The present work studies a non-Markovian forced thermal ratchet model on an
asymmetric periodic potential. The Brownian dynamics is described by a
generalized Langevin equation with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type friction memory
kernel. We show that for the case of a time-dependent driving force, also in
the form of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-like process, an exact expression of the
probability current can be derived. We also obtain the behavior of the
particle's average rate of flow as a function of the external amplitude force
and of the bath temperature when the driving force behaves as a square wave
modulation. All our results are compared with those obtained in the Markovian
case and we find, fairly remarkably, that in some cases a friction memory
kernel results in an enhancement of the current

<h3>Acceptor and compensating donor doping of single crystalline SnO (001)  films grown by molecular beam epitaxy and its perspectives for  optoelectronics and gas-sensing</h3>

<br>
<br>
(La and Ga)-doped tin monoxide (stannous oxide, tin (II) oxide, SnO) thin
films were grown by plasma-assisted and suboxide molecular beam epitaxy with
dopant concentrations ranging from $\approx5\times10^{18}$cm$^{-3}$ to
$2\times10^{21}$cm$^{-3}$. In this concentration range, the incorporation of Ga
into SnO was limited by the formation of secondary phases observed at
$1.2\times10^{21}$cm$^{-3}$ Ga, while the incorporation of La showed a lower
solubility limit. Transport measurements on the doped samples reveal that Ga
acts as an acceptor and La as a compensating donor. While Ga doping led to an
increase of the hole concentration from
$1\times10^{18}$cm$^{-3}-1\times10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$ for unintentionally (UID) SnO
up to $5\times10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$, La-concentrations well in excess of the UID
acceptor concentration resulted in semi-insulating films without detectable
$n$-type conductivity. Ab-initio calculations qualitatively agree with our
dopant assignment of Ga and La, and further predict In$_\text{Sn}$ to act as an
acceptor as well as Al$_\text{Sn}$ and B$_\text{Sn}$ as donor. These results
show the possibilities of controlling the hole concentration in $p$-type SnO,
which can be useful for a range of optoelectronic and gas-sensing applications.

<h3>Defining graphenic crystallites in disordered carbon: moving beyond the  platelet model</h3>

<br>
<i>Kate J. Putman, Nigel A. Marks, Matthew R. Rowles, Carla de Tomas, Jacob W. Martin, Irene Suarez-Martinez</i>
<br>
<br>
We develop a picture of graphenic crystallites within disordered carbons that
goes beyond the traditional model of graphitic platelets at random orientation.
Using large atomistic models containing one million atoms, we redefine the
meaning of the quantity La extracted from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Two
complementary approaches are used to measure the size of graphenic
crystallites, which are defined as regions of regularly arranged hexagons.
Firstly, we calculate the X-ray diffraction pattern directly from the atomistic
coordinates of the structure and analyse them following a typical experimental
process. Second, the graphenic crystallites are identified from a direct
geometrical approach. By mapping the structure directly, we replace the
idealised picture of the crystallite with a more realistic representation of
the material and provide a well-defined interpretation for $L_a$ measurements
of disordered carbon. A key insight is that the size distribution is skewed
heavily towards small fragments, with more than 75% of crystallites smaller
than half of $L_a$.

<i>Jia-Wei Wu, Yu Cui, Shao-Juan Li, Zi-Wu Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
We theoretically study the optical absorption of an angulon in the metal
halide perovskites (MHP) based on the improved Devreese-Huybrechts-Lemmens
model, where the formation of quasiparticle angulon states originates from the
organic cation rotating in the inorganic octahedral cage of MHP. We find that
the resonance optical absorption peaks are appeared when the energy of incident
photon matches the quantum levels of angulon. Moreover, the intensity of
absorption depends on the quantum states of phonon angular momentum. These
theoretical results provide significant insight to study the redistribution of
angular momenta for the rotational molecules immersed into the many-body
environment.

<h3>Transmission Kikuchi diffraction mapping induces structural damage in  atom probe specimens</h3>

<i>Baptiste Gault, Heena Khanchandani, T.S. Prithiv, Stoichko Antonov, T. Ben Britton</i>
<br>
<br>
The examination of the local chemistry of a specific interface by atom probe
tomography (APT) is increasingly facilitated by using transmission Kikuchi
diffraction (TKD) to help position specific crystallographic features
sufficiently close to the apex of the needle shaped specimen. However, possible
structural damage associated by the energetic electrons used to perform TKD is
only rarely considered and is hence not well-understood. Here, in two case
studies, we demonstrate that APT specimens are subject to electron beam damage
during TKD mapping. First, we analyze a solid solution, metastable
\b{eta}-Ti-12Mo alloy, in which the Mo is expected to be homogenously
distributed, yet APT reveals a planar segregation of Mo amongst other elements.
Second, specimens were prepared near {\Sigma}3 twin boundaries in a high
manganese twinning-induced plasticity steel, and subsequently charged with
deuterium gas. Beyond a similar planar segregation, voids containing a high
concentration of deuterium are detected. Both examples showcase damage from TKD
mapping leading to artefacts in the compositional distribution of solutes. We
propose that the structural damage is created by surface species, including H
and C, subjected to recoil from incoming energetic electrons during mapping,
thereby getting implanted and causing cascades of structural damage in the
sample.

<br>
<br>
We study long-range order in two dimensions where an order parameter is
advected by linear laminar flows. The linear laminar flows include three
classes: rotational, shear, and elongational flows. Under these flows, we
analyze an ordered state of the $O(N)$ scalar model in the large-$N$ limit. We
show that the stability of the ordered state depends on the flow pattern; the
shear and elongational flows stabilize but the rotational flow does not. We
discuss a physical interpretation of our results based on interaction
representation in quantum mechanics. The origin of the long-range order is
interpreted from the advection of wavenumbers along the streamlines and its
stretching effect stabilizes the order.

<h3>Antiferromagnetic iron based magnetoelectric compounds</h3>

<br>
<br>
The Landau free-energy of a compound that benefits from a linear coupling of
an electric field and a magnetic field includes a product of the two fields,
one polar and time-even and one axial and time-odd. In ME compounds,
expectation values of some atomic magnetic tensors are invariant with respect
to anti-inversion. An invariance shared by the Dirac monopole (an element of
charge allowed in Maxwell's equations that has not been observed) and a
Zeldovich anapole, also known as a Dirac dipole. From the science of materials
perspective, it has been established that Dirac multipoles contribute to the
diffraction of x-rays and neutrons. We identify Dirac monopoles in bulk
magnetic properties of iron tellurate (Fe2TeO6) and a spin ladder (SrFe2S2O).
Both cited compounds present a simple antiferromagnetic configuration of axial
dipoles, and their different magnetic crystal classes allow a linear ME effect.
However, the Kerr effect is symmetry allowed in the spin ladder and forbidden
in iron tellurate. Anapoles are forbidden in iron tellurate and allowed in the
spin ladder compound, a difference evident in diffraction patterns fully
informed by symmetry. More generally, we identify a raft of Dirac multipoles,
and axial multipoles beyond dipoles, visible in future experiments using
standard techniques with beams of neutrons or x-rays tuned in energy to an iron
atomic resonance. ME invariance imposes a phase relationship between nuclear
(charge) and magnetic contributions to neutron (x-ray) diffraction amplitudes.
In consequence, intensities of Bragg spots in an x-ray pattern do not change
when helicity in the primary beam is reversed. A like effect occurs in the
magnetic diffraction of polarized neutrons.

<h3>Non-local linear response in anomalous transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06408" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06408</a>
<br>
<i>Anupam Kundu</i>
<br>
<br>
Anomalous heat transport observed in low dimensional classical systems is
associated to super-diffusive spreading of space-time correlation of the
conserved fields in the system. This leads to non-local linear response
relation between the heat current and the local temperature gradient in
non-equilibrium steady state. This relation provides a generalisation of
Fourier's law of heat transfer and is characterised by a non-local kernel
operator which is related to fractional operators describing super-diffusion.
The kernel is essentially proportional, in appropriate scaling limit, to the
time integral of the space-time correlations of local currents in equilibrium.
In finite size systems, the time integral of correlation of microscopic
currents at different locations over infinite duration is independent of the
locations. On the other hand the kernel operator is space-dependent. We
demonstrate that the resolution of this apparent puzzle appears through taking
appropriate combination of limits of large system size and large integration
time duration. Our study shows the importance of taking the limits in proper
way even for (open) systems connected to reservoirs. In particular we reveal
how to extract the kernel operator from simulation data of microscopic
current-current correlation. For two model systems exhibiting anomalous
transport, we provide direct and detailed numerical verification of the kernel
operators.

We present an ab initio method for eletcronic structure calculations, which
accounts for the interaction of electrons and magnons in ferromagnets. While it
is based on a many body perturbation theory we approximate numerically complex
quantities with quantities from time dependent density functional theory. This
results in a simple and affordable algorithm which allows us to consider more
complex materials than those usually studied in this context ($3d$
ferromagnets) while still being able to account for the non-locality of the
self energy. Furthermore, our approach allows for a relatively simple way to
incorporate self-consistency. Our results are in a good agreement with
experimental and theoretical findings for iron and nickel. Especially the
experimental exchange splitting of nickel is predicted accurately within our
theory. Additionally, we study the halfmetallic ferromagnet NiMnSb concerning
its non-qusiparticle states appearing in the bandgap due to spin-flip
excitations.

We theoretically predict and experimentally observe the onset of weak-link
physics in the dynamical response of transition edge sensors (TES). We develop
a theoretical framework based on a Fokker-Planck description that unifies the
TES electrical response, stemming from Josephson phenomena, with electrothermal
effects due to coupling to a thermal bath. Our measurements of a varying
dynamic resistance are in excellent agreement with our theory, thereby ruling
out predictions based on a two-fluid model and establishing weak-link phenomena
as the main mechanism underlying the operation of TES. Furthermore, our
description enables the calculation of power spectral densities, paving the way
for a more thorough investigation of the unexplained "excess noise" in long
diffusive junctions and TES reported in recent experiments.

Thermoelectric materials can be used to construct devices which recycle waste
heat into electricity. However, the best known thermoelectrics are based on
rare, expensive or even toxic elements, which limits their widespread adoption.
To enable deployment on global scales, new classes of effective thermoelectrics
are thus required. $\textit{Ab initio}$ models of transport properties can help
in the design of new thermoelectrics, but they are still too computationally
expensive to be solely relied upon for high-throughput screening in the vast
chemical space of all possible candidates. Here, we use models constructed with
modern machine learning techniques to scan very large areas of inorganic
materials space for novel thermoelectrics, using composition as an input. We
employ an attention-based deep learning model, trained on data derived from
$\textit{ab initio}$ calculations, to predict a material's Seebeck coefficient,
electrical conductivity, and power factor over a range of temperatures and
$\textit{n}$- or $\textit{p}$-type doping levels, with surprisingly good
performance given the simplicity of the input, and with significantly lower
computational cost. The results of applying the model to a space of known and
hypothetical binary and ternary selenides reveal several materials that may
represent promising thermoelectrics. Our study establishes a protocol for
composition-based prediction of thermoelectric behaviour that can be easily
enhanced as more accurate theoretical or experimental databases become
available.

Silicon spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for large scale
quantum computers, due to their excellent coherence and compatibility with CMOS
technology for upscaling. Advanced industrial CMOS process flows allow
wafer-scale uniformity and high device yield, but off the shelf transistor
processes cannot be directly transferred to qubit structures due to the
different designs and operation conditions. To therefore leverage the know-how
of the micro-electronics industry, we customize a 300mm wafer fabrication line
for silicon MOS qubit integration. With careful optimization and engineering of
the MOS gate stack, we report stable and uniform quantum dot operation at the
Si/SiOx interface at milli-Kelvin temperature. We extract the charge noise in
different devices and under various operation conditions, demonstrating a
record-low average noise level of 0.61 ${\mu}$eV/${\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and even
below 0.1 ${\mu}$eV/${\sqrt{Hz}}$ for some devices and operating conditions. By
statistical analysis of the charge noise with different operation and device
parameters, we show that the noise source can indeed be well described by a
two-level fluctuator model. This reproducible low noise level, in combination
with uniform operation of our quantum dots, marks CMOS manufactured MOS spin
qubits as a mature and highly scalable platform for high fidelity qubits.

The synergy between non-Hermitian concepts and topological ideas have led to
very fruitful activity in the recent years. Their interplay has resulted in a
wide variety of new non-Hermitian topological phenomena being discovered. In
this review, we present the key principles underpinning the topological
features of non-Hermitian phases. Using paradigmatic models -- Hatano-Helson,
non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and non-Hermitian Chern insulator -- we
illustrate the central features of non-Hermitian topological systems, including
exceptional points, complex energy gaps and non-Hermitian symmetry
classification. We discuss the non-Hermitian skin effect and the notion of the
generalized Brillouin zone, which allows restoring the bulk-boundary
correspondence. Using concrete examples, we examine the role of disorder,
present the linear response framework, and analyze the Hall transport
properties of non-Hermitian topological systems. We also survey the rapidly
growing experimental advances in this field. Finally, we end by highlighting
possible directions which, in our view, may be promising for explorations in
the near future.

The spin waves in single crystals of the layered van der Waals
antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ have been measured using inelastic neutron scattering.
The data show four distinct spin wave branches with large ($\gtrsim 14$ meV)
energy gaps at the Brillouin zone center indicating significant anisotropy. The
data were modelled using linear spin wave theory derived from a Heisenberg
Hamiltonian. Exchange interactions up to the third nearest-neighbour in the
layered planes were required to fit the data with ferromagnetic $J_1 = -1.37$
meV between first neighbours, antiferromagnetic $J_3 = 3.0$ meV between third
neighbours, and a very small $J_2 = 0.09$ meV between second neighbours. A
biaxial single-ion anisotropy was required, with a collinear term $D^x = -0.77$
meV for the axis parallel to the aligned moment direction and a coplanar term
$D^z=6.07$ meV for an axis approximately normal to the layered crystal planes.

Supercurrent transport is experimentally studied in a Josephson junction
hosting a double quantum dot (DQD) with tunable symmetries. The QDs are
parallel-coupled to two superconducting contacts and can be tuned between
strong inter-dot hybridization and a ring geometry where hybridization is
suppressed. In both cases, we observe supercurrents when the two interacting
orbitals are either empty or filled with spins, or a combination. However, when
each QD hosts an unpaired spin, the supercurrent depends on the spin ground
state. It is strongly suppressed for the ring geometry with a spin-triplet
ground state at zero external magnetic field. By increasing the QD
hybridization, we find that a supercurrent appears when the ground state
changes to spin-singlet. In general, supercurrents are suppressed in cases of
spin doublet ground state, but an exception occurs at orbital degeneracy when
the system hosts one additional spin, as opposed to three, pointing to a broken
particle-hole symmetry.

<h3>Random matrices with row constraints and eigenvalue distributions of  graph Laplacians</h3>

Symmetric matrices with zero row sums occur in many theoretical settings and
in real-life applications. When the offdiagonal elements of such matrices are
i.i.d. random variables and the matrices are large, the eigenvalue
distributions converge to a peculiar universal curve
$p_{\mathrm{zrs}}(\lambda)$ that looks like a cross between the Wigner
semicircle and a Gaussian distribution. An analytic theory for this curve,
originally due to Fyodorov, can be developed using supersymmetry-based
techniques.
We extend these derivations to the case of sparse matrices, including the
important case of graph Laplacians for large random graphs with $N$ vertices of
mean degree $c$. In the regime $1\ll c\ll N$, the eigenvalue distribution of
the ordinary graph Laplacian (diffusion with a fixed transition rate per edge)
tends to a shifted and scaled version of $p_{\mathrm{zrs}}(\lambda)$, centered
at $c$ with width $\sim\sqrt{c}$. At smaller $c$, this curve receives
corrections in powers of $1/\sqrt{c}$ accurately captured by our theory. For
the normalized graph Laplacian (diffusion with a fixed transition rate per
vertex), the large $c$ limit is a shifted and scaled Wigner semicircle, again
with corrections captured by our analysis.

We investigate the robustness of topological superconductors under the
perturbing influence of a finite charge current. To this aim, we introduce a
modified Kitaev Hamiltonian parametrically dependent on the quasiparticle
momentum induced by the current. Using different quantifiers of the topological
phase, such as the Majorana polarization and the edge state quantum conditional
mutual information, we prove the existence of a finite critical value of the
quasiparticle momentum below which edge modes and topological superconductivity
survive. We also discuss how a finite current breaks time reversal symmetry and
changes the topological class in the Altland-Zirnbauer classification scheme
compared to the case of isolated systems. Our findings provide a nontrivial
example of the interplay between topology and the nonequilibrium physics of
open quantum systems, a relation of crucial importance in the quest to a viable
topological quantum electronics.

<br>
The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPE) leads to the generation of a photocurrent
from an asymmetric material. Despite drawing much attention due to its ability
to generate photovoltages above the band gap ($E_g$), it is considered a weak
effect due to the low generated photocurrents. Here, we show that a remarkably
high photoresponse can be achieved by exploiting the BPE in simple planar
BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) films, solely by tuning their fundamental ferroelectric
properties via strain and growth orientation induced by epitaxial growth on
different substrates. We find a non-monotonic dependence of the responsivity
($R_{\rm SC}$) on the ferroelectric polarization ($P$) and obtain a remarkably
high BPE coefficient ($\beta$) of $\approx$10$^{-2}$ 1/V, which to the best of
our knowledge is the highest reported to date for standard planar BTO thin
films. We show that the standard first-principles-based descriptions of BPE in
bulk materials cannot account for the photocurrent trends observed for our
films and therefore propose a novel mechanism that elucidates the fundamental
relationship between $P$ and responsivity in ferroelectric thin films. Our
results suggest that practical applications of ferroelectric photovoltaics in
standard planar film geometries can be achieved through careful joint
optimization of the bulk structure, light absorption, and electrode-absorber
interface properties.

In this work we adapt the foundations of relativistic kinetic theory and the
Boltzmann equation to particles with Lorentz-violating dispersion relations.
The latter are taken to be those associated to two commonly considered sets of
coefficients in the minimal Standard-Model Extension. We treat both the cases
of classical (Maxwell-Boltzmann) and quantum (Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein)
statistics. It is shown that with the appropriate definition of the entropy
current, Boltzmann's H-theorem continues to hold. We derive the equilibrium
solutions and then identify the Lorentz-violating effects for various
thermodynamic variables, as well as for Bose-Einstein condensation. Finally, a
scenario with non-elastic collisions between multiple species of particles
corresponding to chemical or nuclear reactions is considered.

We investigate the effect of defect geometry in dictating the sensitivity of
the critical buckling conditions of spherical shells under external pressure
loading. Specifically, we perform a comparative study between shells containing
dimpled (inward) versus bumpy (outward) Gaussian defects. The former has become
the standard shape in many recent shell-buckling studies, whereas the latter
has remained mostly unexplored. We employ finite-element simulations, which
were validated previously against experiments, to compute the knockdown factors
for the two cases while systematically exploring the parameter space of the
defect geometry. For the same magnitudes of the amplitude and angular width of
the defect, we find that shells containing bumpy defects consistently exhibit
significantly higher knockdown factors than shells with the more classic
dimpled defects. Furthermore, the relationship of the knockdown as a function
of the amplitude and width of the defect is qualitatively different between the
two cases, which also exhibit distinct post-buckling behavior. A speculative
interpretation of the results is provided based on the qualitative differences
in the mean-curvature profiles of the two cases.

Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are counter-intuitive localized states
with eigenvalues embedded in the continuum of extended states. Recently,
nontrivial band topology is exploited to enrich the BIC physics, resulted in
topological BICs (TBICs) with extraordinary robustness against perturbations or
disorders. Here, we propose a simple but universal mirror-stacking approach to
turn nontrivial bound states of any topological monolayer model into TBICs.
Physically, the mirror-stacked bilayer Hamiltonian can be decoupled into two
independent subspaces of opposite mirror parities, each of which inherits the
energy spectrum information and band topology of the original monolayer. By
tuning the interlayer couplings, the topological bound state of one subspace
can move into and out of the continuum of the other subspace continuously
without hybridization. As representative examples, we construct one-dimensional
first-order and two-dimensional higher-order TBICs, and demonstrate them
unambiguously by acoustic experiments. Our findings will expand the research
implications of both topological materials and BICs.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD) in
particular are at the forefront of nanotechnology. To tailor properties for
engineering applications, alloying strategies used for bulk metals in the last
century need to be extended to this novel class of materials. Here we present a
systematic analysis of the phase behaviour of substitutional 2D alloys in the
TMD family on both the metal and chalcogenide site. The phase behaviour is
quantified in terms of a metastability metric and benchmarked against
systematic computational screening of configurational energy landscapes. The
resulting Pettifor maps can be used to identify broad trends across chemical
spaces and as starting point for setting up rational search strategies in phase
space, thus allowing for targeted computational analysis of properties on
likely thermodynamically stable compounds. The results presented here also
constitute a useful guideline for synthesis of binary metal 2D TMDs alloys via
a range of synthesis techniques.

First-passage properties of continuous stochastic processes confined in a
1--dimensional interval are well described. However, for jump processes
(discrete random walks), the characterization of the corresponding observables
remains elusive, despite their relevance in various contexts. Here we derive
exact asymptotic expressions for the leftward, rightward and complete exit time
distributions from the interval $[0,x]$ for symmetric jump processes starting
from $x_0=0$, in the large $x$ and large time limit. We show that both the
leftward probability $F_{\underline{0},x}(n)$ to exit through $0$ at step $n$
and rightward probability $F_{0,\underline{x}}(n)$ to exit through $x$ at step
$n$ exhibit a universal behavior dictated by the large distance decay of the
jump distribution parameterized by the Levy exponent $\mu$. In particular, we
exhaustively describe the $n\ll x^\mu$ and $n\gg x^\mu$ limits and obtain
explicit results in both regimes. Our results finally provide exact asymptotics
for exit time distributions of jump processes in regimes where continuous
limits do not apply.

Topological features embedded in ancient braiding and knotting arts endow
significant impacts on our daily life and even cutting-edge science. Recently,
fast growing efforts are invested to the braiding topology of complex Bloch
bands in non-Hermitian systems. This new classification of band topology goes
far beyond those established in Hermitian counterparts. Here, we present the
first acoustic realization of the topological non-Hermitian Bloch braids, based
on a two-band model easily accessible for realizing any desired knot structure.
The non-Hermitian bands are synthesized by a simple binary cavity-tube system,
where the long-range, complex-valued, and momentum-resolved couplings are
accomplished by a well-controlled unidirectional coupler. In addition to
directly visualizing various two-band braiding patterns, we unambiguously
observe the highly-elusive topological phase transitions between them. Not only
do our results provide a direct demonstration for the non-Hermitian band
topology, but also the experimental techniques open new avenues for designing
unconventional acoustic metamaterials.

We present the effect of oxidative etching in FLG/TiO$_2$ hybrids on FLG
edges chemistry/morphology addressing also the catalytic activity of TiO$_2$
NPs. According to the XPS and TGA analysis the oxidation degree strongly
depends on TiO$_2$:FLG ratio. The preparation of two series of FLG/TiO$_2$
hybrids via sol-gel method and in-situ oxidation permitted to correctly
describe and distinguish the chemical composition, core shift and charge
distribution in C1s XPS with Tip peak as reference. Such analysis is
challenging in carbon materials due the overlapping of C1s peaks from the
sample and adventitious carbon reference. We claim the formation of interfacial
dipole as possible direct signature of charge transfer from TiO$_2$ to FLG. A
downward shift of C1s (sp$^2$C) up to 1.4 eV is measured and contributions of
non sp$^2$C are determined in the composites. The modifications related to the
oxidation are supported by TEM/SEM observations, and referred to non-catalytic
oxidation and oxidation in mechanically mixed components.

The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect has attracted extensive research interest
because of the potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing,
which is attributable to two conducting edge channels with opposite spin
polarization and the quantized electronic conductance of 2e2/h. Recently,
2M-WS2, a new stable phase of transition metal dichalcogenides with a 2M
structure showing an identical layer configuration to that of the monolayer 1T'
TMDs, was suggested to be a QSH insulator as well as a superconductor with
critical transition temperature around 8 K. Here, high-resolution
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES are
applied to investigate the electronic and spin structure of the topological
surface states (TSS) in the superconducting 2M-WS2. The TSS exhibits
characteristic spin-momentum-locking behavior, suggesting the existence of
long-sought nontrivial Z2 topological states therein. We expect that 2M-WS2
with co-existing superconductivity and TSS might host the promising Majorana
bound states.

<h3>Atomic-scale description of the paramagnetic susceptibility of  non-magnetic Ba$_2$YMoO$_6$</h3>

We succeeded in remarkably nice theoretical description of the temperature
dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility of Ba$_2$YMoO$_6$ in the whole
temperature range as originating from the atomic-scale discrete electronic
structure of Mo$^{5+}$ ions in the 4d$^1$ configuration resulting from
crystal-field and spin-orbit interactions. A strong violation of the
Curie-Weiss law and a nonmagnetic state of BYMo experimentally-observed down to
50 mK is caused by the dramatical reduction of the Mo-ion magnetic moment. The
quantitative reproduction of $\chi$(T) proves that almost all Mo ions are in
the Mo$^{5+}$ state over the whole temperature range.

The creation of moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayers of two-dimensional
crystals has been utilised to engineer quantum material properties in graphene
and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors. Here, we examine the
structural relaxation and electronic properties in small-angle twisted bilayers
of metallic NbSe$_2$, which appears to be particularly strong for misalignment
angles $\theta_P$ < 2.9$^o$ and $\theta_{AP}$ < 1.2$^o$ for parallel (P) and
antiparallel (AP) orientation of monolayers' unit cells, respectively.
Multiscale modelling reveals the formation of domains and domain walls with
distinct stacking, for which density functional theory (DFT) calculations are
used to map the shape of the bilayer Fermi surface, demonstrating a significant
modulation of interlayer coupling across the moir\'e superstructure.

<h3>A generalized multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz: more  accurate conformal data from a critical lattice model</h3>

The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) provides a natural
description of the ground state of a quantum critical Hamiltonian on the
lattice. From an optimized MERA, one can extract the scaling dimensions of the
underlying conformal field theory. However, extracting conformal data from the
ascending superoperator derived from MERA seems to have a limited range of
accuracy, even after increasing the bond dimension. Here, we propose an
alternative ansatz based on an increasing number of disentangling layers. This
leads to generalized versions of MERA that improve the extraction of scaling
dimensions, as tested in the Gaussian MERA setting for the critical Ising
model.

Heat-capacity measurements are a useful tool for understanding the complex
phase behaviour of systems containing one-dimensional motifs. Here we study the
signature within such measurements of the incorporation of defects into
quasi-one-dimensional (q-1D) systems. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show
that, on dilution by non-interacting sites, q-1D Ising models display a
low-temperature signature not present in conventional three-dimensional models.
Frustrated embeddings of 1D chains show similar features to unfrustrated
embeddings, with the additional emergence of a finite ground-state entropy in
the former, which arises from chain segmentation. We introduce a mean-field
formulation which captures the low-temperature behaviour of the model. This
theoretical framework is applied to the interpretation of experimental
heat-capacity measurements of the Tb$_{1-\rho}$Y$_{\rho}$(HCOO)$_3$ family of
magnetocalorics. We find good correspondence between simulation and experiment,
establishing this system as a canonical example of dilute q-1D magnets.

We propose an element-agnostic set of descriptors to model superalloy
properties with Gaussian process regression. Furthermore, we develop a
correction method to deliver the best and most physical predictions for
microchemistry in multi-phase alloys. The models' performance in predictions is
confirmed for superalloy microchemistry, microstructure, and strength
properties. When including new, unseen elements in the test data, the models
still give good predictions; such extrapolations into new chemical-space would
be impossible with component-based descriptors.

We address magnetic neutron scattering in the presence of local
non-centrosymmetric asymmetries of the magnetization density. Such
inversion-symmetry breaking, combined with the absence of time-reversal
symmetry, can be described in terms of magnetoelectric multipoles which form
the second term after the magnetic dipole in the multipole expansion of the
magnetization density. We provide a pedagogical review of the theoretical
formalism of magnetic neutron diffraction in terms of the multipole expansion
of the scattering cross-section. In particular, we show how to compute the
contribution of magnetoelectric multipoles to the scattering amplitude starting
from ab initio calculations. We also provide general guidelines on how to
experimentally detect long-ranged order of magnetoelectric multipoles using
either unpolarized or polarized neutron scattering. As a case study, we search
for the presence of magnetoelectric multipoles in CuO by comparing theoretical
first-principle predictions with experimental spherical neutron polarimetry
measurements.

<h3>Emergent grain boundary phases in stressed polycrystalline thin films</h3>

The grain boundary (GB) microstructure influences and is influenced by the
development of residual stresses during synthesis of polycrystalline thin
films. Recent studies have shown that the frustration between the preferred
growth direction and rotations of abutting crystals to local cusps in GB
energies leads to internal stresses localized within nanoscopic surface layers
around the valleys and ridges that form at emergent boundaries (eGBs). Using a
combination of continuum frameworks, numerical analyses and all-atom
simulations of bicrystal $\langle 111\rangle$ copper films, we show that eGBs
tune their surface morphology and rotation extent in response to external
strains. Compression favors rotation to and growth of low energy GB phases
(complexions) at eGB valleys while tension favors the transitions at eGB
ridges, a reflection of the stress-induced mass efflux/influx that changes the
energetic balance between interfacial and deformation energies. Molecular
dynamics simulations of strained and growing bicrystal films reveal that the
eGB phase transition is coupled to island formation at the surface triple
junctions, providing a direct link between eGB phases and surface step flow.
The interplay between eGB structure, morphology and mechanics emerges as a
crucial ingredient for predictive understanding of stress and morphological
evolution during film growth, with broad implications for multifunctional
response of polycrystalline surfaces in a diverse range of surface phenomena
such as surface mediated deformation, interfacial embrittlement, thermal
grooving, stress corrosion, surface catalysis and topological conduction.

Pressure is a unique tuning parameter for probing the properties of materials
and has been particularly useful for studies of electronic materials such as
high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Here we report the effects of
quasi-hydrostatic compression produced by a neon pressure-medium on the
structures of bismuth-based high $\mathit{T_c}$ cuprate superconductors with
the nominal composition $Bi_2Sr_2Ca_{n-1}Cu_nO_{2n+4+\delta}$ (n=1,2,3) up to
155 GPa. The structures of all three compositions obtained by synchrotron X-ray
diffraction can be described as pseudo-tetragonal over the entire pressure
range studied. We show that previously reported pressure-induced distortions
and structural changes arise from the large strains that can be induced in
these layered materials by non-hydrostatic stresses. The pressure-volume
equations of state (EOS) measured under these quasi-hydrostatic conditions
cannot be fit to single phenomenological formulation over the pressure ranges
studied, starting below 20 GPa. This intrinsic anomalous compression as well as
the sensitivity of $Bi_2Sr_2Ca_{n-1}Cu_nO_{2n+4+\delta}$ to deviatoric stresses
provides explanations for the numerous inconsistencies in reported EOS
parameters for these materials. We conclude that the anomalous compressional
behavior of all three compositions is a manifestation of the changes in
electronic properties that are also responsible for the remarkable
non-monotonic dependence of $\mathit{T_c}$ with pressure, including the
increase in $\mathit{T_c}$ at the highest pressures studied so far for each.
Transport and spectroscopic measurements up to megabar pressures are needed to
fully characterize and explore still higher possible critical temperatures in
these materials.

<h3>Deformable Molecular Crystal on 2D Crystal: A New Way to Build Nanoscale  Periodic Trapping Sites for Interlayer Excitons</h3>

The nanoscale moir\'e pattern formed at 2D transition metal dichalcogenide
crystal (TMDC) heterostructures provides periodic trapping sites for excitons,
which is essential for realizing various exotic phases such as artificial
exciton lattices, Bose-Einstein condensates, and exciton insulators. At organic
molecule/TMDC heterostructures, similar periodic potentials can be formed via
other degrees of freedom. We utilize the structure deformability of a 2D
molecular crystal as a degree of freedom to create a periodic nanoscale
potential that can trap interlayer excitons (IXs). Specifically, two
semiconducting molecules, PTCDI and PTCDA, which possess similar bandgaps and
ionization potentials but form different lattice structures on MoS2, are
investigated.The PTCDI lattice on MoS2 is distorted geometrically, which lifts
the degeneracy of the two molecules within the crystal's unit cell. The
degeneracy lifting results in a spatial variation of the molecular orbital
energy, with an amplitude and periodicity of ~ 0.2 eV and ~ 2 nm, respectively.
On the other hand, no such energy variation is observed in PTCDA/MoS2, where
the PTCDA lattice is much less distorted. The periodic variation in molecular
orbital energies provides effective trapping sites for IXs. For IXs formed at
PTCDI/MoS2, rapid spatial localization of the electron in the organic layer
towards the interface is observed, which demonstrate the effectiveness of these
interfacial IX's traps.

<br>
<br>
We investigate the high-pressure phase of the iron-based superconductor
FeSe$_{0.89}$S$_{0.11}$ using transport and tunnel diode oscillator studies. We
construct detailed pressure-temperature phase diagrams that indicate that
outside of the nematic phase, the superconducting critical temperature reaches
a minimum before it is quickly enhanced towards 40 K above 4 GPa. The
resistivity data reveal signatures of a fan-like structure of non-Fermi liquid
behaviour which could indicate the existence of a putative quantum critical
point buried underneath the superconducting dome around 4.3 GPa. Further
increasing the pressure, the zero-field electrical resistivity develops a
non-metallic temperature dependence and the superconducting transition broadens
significantly. Eventually, the system fails to reach a fully zero-resistance
state despite a continuous finite superconducting transition temperature, and
any remaining resistance at low temperatures becomes strongly
current-dependent. Our results suggest that the high-pressure, high-$T_c$ phase
of iron chalcogenides is very fragile and sensitive to uniaxial effects of the
pressure medium, cell design and sample thickness which can trigger a
first-order transition. These high-pressure regions could be understood
assuming a real-space phase separation caused by concomitant electronic and
structural instabilities.
