<h3>Unavoidable Fermi liquid instabilities in sign problem-free models</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11262" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11262</a>

<i>Ori Grossman, Erez Berg</i>

Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a powerful numerical technique to
study many-body fermionic systems. In recent years, several classes of
sign-free (SF) models have been discovered, where the notorious sign problem
can be circumvented. However, it is not clear what are the inherent physical
characteristics and limitations of SF models. In particular, which
zero-temperature quantum phases of matter are accessible within such models,
and which are fundamentally inaccessible? Here, we show that a model of any of
the known SF classes within DQMC cannot have a stable Fermi liquid ground state
in spatial dimension $d\ge 2$. For SF models belonging to one of the symmetry
classes (where the absence of the sign problem follows from a combination of
non-unitary symmetries of the fermionic action), any putative Fermi liquid
fixed point generically includes an attractive Cooper-like interaction that
destabilizes it. In the recently discovered lower-symmetry classes of SF
models, the Fermi surface is generically unstable even at the level of the
quadratic action. Our results suggest a fundamental link between Fermi liquids
and the fermion sign problem.

<h3>In-Plane Electric Field Induced Orbital Hybridization of Excitonic  States In Monolayer WSe2</h3>

The giant exciton binding energy and the richness of degrees of freedom make
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide an unprecedented playground for
exploring exciton physics in 2D systems. Thanks to the well energetically
separated excitonic states, the response of the discrete excitonic states to
the electric field could be precisely examined. Here we utilize the
photocurrent spectroscopy to probe excitonic states under a static in-plane
electric field. We demonstrate that the in-plane electric field leads to a
significant orbital hybridization of Rydberg excitonic states with different
angular momentum (especially orbital hybridization of 2s and 2p) and
consequently optically actives 2p-state exciton. Besides, the electric-field
controlled mixing of the high lying exciton state and continuum band enhances
the oscillator strength of the discrete excited exciton states. This electric
field modulation of the excitonic states in monolayer TMDs provides a paradigm
of the manipulation of 2D excitons for potential applications of the
electro-optical modulation in 2D semiconductors.

<h3>Effect of rigid top surface on the onset of phototactic bioconvection</h3>

Phototaxis is the movement of microorganisms towards or away from light. In
presence of dim (intense) light, microorganisms move towards (away from) the
light sources, which is known as positive (negative) phototaxis. In this study,
we present a model in which isotropic scattering algae suspension is
illuminated by both diffuse and collimated irradiation, and the top surface is
assumed to be rigid. Bimodal steady states result from the scattering Effect
(for almost purely scattering suspension), which transits into a unimodal
steady state as diffuse light intensity increases. The linear stability of the
same suspension is also examined using the linear perturbation theory, which
predicts the solutions' stable and oscillatory nature for specific parameter
values. Here, we also observe that suspension becomes more stable in a rigid
top surface and diffuse irradiation.

<h3>Complex path simulations of geometrically frustrated ladders</h3>

Quantum systems with geometrical frustration remain an outstanding challenge
for numerical simulations due to the infamous numerical sign problem. Here, we
overcome this obstruction via complex path integration in a geometrically
frustrated ladder of interacting bosons at finite density. This enables studies
of the many-body ground state properties, otherwise inaccessible with standard
quantum Monte Carlo methods. Specifically, we study a chemical potential tuned
quantum phase transition, along which we track the emergence of quasi long
range order and critical softening of the single particle gap. We chart future
methodological improvements and applications in generalized geometrically
frustrated lattice models.

<h3>Dynamical mean-field theory for Rényi entanglement entropy and  mutual Information in Hubbard Model</h3>

Quantum entanglement, lacking any classical counterpart, provides a
fundamental new route to characterize the quantum nature of many-body states.
In this work, we discuss an implementation of a new path integral method [Phys.
Rev. Res. 2, 033505 (2020)] for fermions to compute entanglement for extended
subsystems in the Hubbard model within dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) in
one and two dimensions. The new path integral formulation measures entanglement
by applying a ``kick" to the underlying interacting fermions. We show that the
R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy can be extracted efficiently within the DMFT
framework by integrating over the strength of the kick term. Using this method,
we compute the second R\'{e}nyi entropy as a function of subsystem size for
metallic and Mott insulating phases of the Hubbard model. We explore the
thermal entropy to entanglement crossover in the subsystem R\'{e}nyi entropy in
the correlated metallic phase. We show that the subsystem-size scaling of
second R\'{e}nyi entropy is well described by the crossover formula which
interpolates between the volume-law thermal R\'{e}nyi entropy and the universal
boundary-law R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy with logarithmic violation, as
predicted by conformal field theory. We also study the mutual information
across the Mott metal-insulator transition.

<h3>Polymer Complexation: Partially Ionizable Asymmetric Polyelectrolytes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10954" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10954</a>
<br>

Studies of the thermodynamics of complex coacervation of pairs of symmetric,
strongly ionizable, oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains are abundant. To
generalize such understanding to asymmetric chain lengths and variable
ionizability (chemical charge density), frequently observed in experiments, we
present a theoretical framework to analyze the effective charge and size of the
complex and the thermodynamics of complexation of two polyions as a function of
such asymmetries. The free energy ensuing from the Edwards' Hamiltonian
undergoes variational extremization, and explicitly accounts for the screened
Coulomb and non-electrostatic interactions among monomers within individual
polyions and between two polyions. Assuming maximal ion-pair formation of the
complexed part, the system free energy comprising configurational entropy of
the polyions and free-ion entropy of the small ions is minimized. The
thermodynamic drive for complexation is found to increase with the ionizability
of the symmetric polyions and to be maximum for symmetric chain lengths for
equally ionizable polyions. The effective charge and size of the complex
increase with asymmetry in charge density, where the size can be substantially
larger than a collapsed globule found for symmetric chains. The regimes of
enthalpy- and entropy-driven complexation are found, respectively, for low and
high Coulomb strengths. The crossover strength is found to be strongly
dependent on the dielectric environment and salt, but marginally dependent on
the charge density, thus implying an entropy-driven process at moderate
strengths. The key results match the trends in simulations and experiments, and
are expected to provide insight for asymmetric complexation in real systems.

<h3>Adiabatic magnon spectra with and without constraining field: Benchmark  against an exact magnon spectrum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10958" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10958</a>
<br>

<br>
<br>
The spectrum of magnon excitations in magnetic materials can be obtained
exactly from the transverse dynamic magnetic susceptibility, which is however
in practice numerically expensive. Many ab initio approaches therefore consider
instead the adiabatic magnon spectrum, which assumes a separation of time
scales of magnons and electronic excitations. There exist two alternative
implementations for adiabatic magnon spectra: one based on the magnetic force
theorem (MFT) and the other with a constraining field that enforces static
non-collinear spin configurations. We benchmark both implementations against
the exact magnon spectrum of an exactly solvable mean-field model. While both
adiabatic methods are equally valid in the low magnon energy and strong Stoner
coupling limits, we find that the constraining field method performs better
than the MFT in both the cases of strong Stoner coupling and high magnon
energies,while the MFT performs better for combined weak coupling and low
magnon energies.

<h3>Two-dimensional inversion symmetry as the fundamental symmetry of  incompressible quantum Hall fluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10968" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10968</a>
<br>
<i>F. D. M. Haldane</i>
<br>
<br>
Two dimensional inversion symmetry ($180^{\circ}$ rotations in the ``Hall
plane'' that hosts the incompressible electron fluid that exhibits the
quantized Hall effect) is identified as its fundamental unbroken symmetry. A
consequence is that the integers $p$ and $q$ which define both the Landau level
filling factor $\nu$ = $p/q$ and the elementary fractional charge $\pm e/q$ of
topological excitations, cannot have a common divisor greater than 2.

<h3>Electron transport and scattering mechanisms in ferromagnetic monolayer  Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10974" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10974</a>
<br>
<i>Danis I. Badrtdinov, Georgy V. Pushkarev, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Alexander N. Rudenko</i>
<br>
<br>
We study intrinsic charge-carrier scattering mechanisms and determine their
contribution to the transport properties of the two-dimensional ferromagnet
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. We use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations combined
with the model approaches to elucidate the role of the electron-phonon and
electron-magnon interactions in the electronic transport. Our findings show
that the charge carrier scattering in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ is dominated by the
electron-phonon interaction, while the role of magnetic excitations is
marginal. At the same time, the magnetic ordering is shown to effect
essentially on the electron-phonon coupling and its temperature dependence.
This leads to a sublinear temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity
near the Curie temperature, which is in line with experimental observations.
The room temperature resistivity is estimated to be $\sim$35 $\mu \Omega
\cdot$cm which may be considered as an intrinsic limit for monolayer
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.

<h3>Robust Majorana bound states in magnetic topological insulator  nanoribbons with fragile chiral edge channels</h3>

<br>
Magnetic topological insulators in the quantum anomalous Hall regime host
ballistic chiral edge channels. When proximitized by an $s$-wave
superconductor, these edge states offer the potential for realizing topological
superconductivity and Majorana bound states without the detrimental effect of
large externally-applied magnetic fields on superconductivity. Realizing
well-separated unpaired Majorana bound states requires magnetic topological
insulator ribbons with width of the order of the transverse extent of the edge
state, however, which brings the required ribbon width down to the sub-100 nm
scale. In this regime, it is known to be extremely difficult to retain the
ballistic nature of chiral edge channels and realize a quantized Hall
conductance. In this work, we study the impact of disorder in such magnetic
topological insulator nanoribbons and compare the fragility of ballistic chiral
edge channels with the stability of Majorana bound states when the ribbon is
covered by a superconducting film. We find that the Majorana bound states
exhibit greater robustness against disorder than the underlying chiral edge
channels.

<h3>Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Twin-Free Bi2Se3 and Sb2Te3 on  In2Se3/InP(111)B Virtual Substrates</h3>

<br>
<br>
Three-dimensional topological insulators (3D-TIs) are a new generation of
materials with insulating bulk and exotic metallic surface states that
facilitate a wide variety of ground-breaking applications. However, utilization
of the surface channels is often hampered by the presence of crystal defects,
such as antisites, vacancies and twin domains. For terahertz device
applications, twinning is shown to be highly deleterious. Previous attempts to
reduce twins using technologically important InP(111) substrates have been
promising, but have failed to completely suppress twin domains while preserving
high structural quality. Here we report growth of twin-free molecular beam
epitaxial Bi2Se3 and Sb2Te3 structures on ultra-thin In2Se3 layers formed by a
novel selenium passivation technique during the oxide desorption of smooth,
non-vicinal InP(111)B substrates, without the use of an indium source. The
formation of un-twinned In2Se3 provides a favorable template to fully suppress
twin domains in 3D-TIs, greatly broadening novel device applications in the
terahertz regime.

<h3>Exchange-Driven Intermixing of Bulk and Topological Surface State by  Chiral Excitons in Bi2Se3</h3>

<br>
<br>
Topological surface states (TSS) in the prototypical topological insulator
(TI) Bi2Se3 are frequently characterized using optical probes, but
electron-hole interactions and their effect on surface localization and optical
response of the TSS remain unexplored. Here, we use ab initio calculations to
understand excitonic effects in the bulk and surface of Bi2Se3. We identify
multiple series of chiral excitons that exhibit both bulk and TSS character,
due to exchange-driven mixing. Our results address fundamental questions about
the degree to which electron-hole interactions can relax the topological
protection of surface states and dipole selection rules for circularly
polarized light in TIs by elucidating the complex intermixture of bulk and
surface states excited in optical measurements and their coupling to light.

<h3>Defect-induced states, defect-induced phase transition and excitonic  states in bent transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoribbons: density  functional vs. many body theory</h3>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have
versatile electronic and optical properties. TMD nanoribbons show interesting
properties due to reduced dimensionality, quantum confinement, and edge states.
Tang et al. showed that the edge bands evolved with bending can tune the
optical properties for various widths of TMD nanoribbons. Defects are commonly
present in 2D TMD materials, and can dramatically change the material
properties. In this following work, we investigate the interaction between the
edge and the defect states in WS2 nanoribbons with line defects under different
bending conditions, using density functional theory (DFT). We reveal
interesting semiconducting-to-metallic phase transitions, suggesting potential
applications in nano-electronics or molecular electronics. We also calculate
the optical absorption of the nanoribbons with different defect positions with
the many-body GW-BSE (Bethe-Salpeter equation) approach, revealing a tunable
optical spectrum and diverse exciton states in the defected TMD nanoribbons.

<br>
<br>
We demonstrate a unique class of advanced materials - quantum composites
based on polymers with fillers comprised of a van der Waals quantum material
that reveals multiple charge-density-wave quantum condensate phases. Materials
that exhibit quantum phenomena are typically crystalline, pure, and have few
defects because disorder destroys the coherence of the electrons and phonons,
leading to collapses of the quantum states. We succeeded in preserving the
macroscopic charge-density-wave phases of filler particles after multiple
composite processing steps. The prepared composites manifest strong
charge-density-wave phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric
constant experiences more than two orders of magnitude enhancement while the
material maintains its electrically insulating properties, opening a venue for
advanced applications in energy storage and electronics. The results present a
conceptually different approach for engineering the properties of materials,
extending the application domain for van der Waals materials.

<h3>Exchange bias in molecule/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures via  spinterface effects</h3>

<br>
<br>
The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin
flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their
magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating
and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to tailor magnetic materials
is molecular functionalization, which leads to hybrid interface states with
peculiar magnetic properties, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects
have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials. Here, we demonstrate
the emergence of spinterface effects at the interface between flakes of the
prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 and thin films of paramagnetic
Co-phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer
induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2, indicating that the unpaired
spins in Co-phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering by proximity and
pin the magnetization reversal of Fe3GeTe2. The effect is strongest for a
Fe3GeTe2 thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches -840 Oe
and is measurable up to approximately 110 K. This value compares very favorably
with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe3GeTe2 in all-inorganic van
der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular
functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.

<br>
<br>
By developing a bidirectional-pump terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, we
reveal an anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) induced THz emission in a single
ferromagnetic film. Based on the distinctive symmetry of the THz signals, ANE
is unequivocally distinguished from the previously attributed ultrafast
demagnetization and anomalous Hall effect mechanisms. A quantitative method is
established to separate the different contributions, demonstrating a
significant ANE contribution that even overwhelms other competing mechanisms.
Our work not only clarifies the origin of the ferromagnetic-based THz emission,
but also offers a fertile platform for investigating the ultrafast magnetism
and THz spintronics.

<h3>Josephson diode based on conventional superconductors and a chiral  quantum dot</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11144</a>
<br>
<i>Qiang Cheng, Qing-Feng Sun</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose theoretically a Josephson diode consisting of the conventional
superconductors with the plain s-wave pairing and a chiral quantum dot. When an
external magnetic field is exerted on the quantum dot, the critical current of
the Josephson structure is different for the opposite directions of current
flow. The strong nonreciprocity can be obtained in a large area of the
parameter space. The inversion and the on/off state of the nonreciprocity can
be conveniently regulated by adjusting the direction of the external field. The
dependences of the nonreciprocal behaviors on the the hopping amplitude, the
magnitude of the magnetic field and the energy level of the quantum dot are
investigated in details using the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function
formalism under the self-consistent procedure. The symmetric and the
antisymmetric properties of the nonreciprocity are analyzed from symmetries
satisfied by the superconductors. The proposed diode effect also applies to
other chiral conductors as interlayer. Its formation has no restriction on the
type of the current-phase difference relations. The generality and flexibility
of our proposed diode effect provides more possibilities for the design of the
dissipationless diode devices.

<h3>The influence of adatom diffusion on the formation of skyrmion lattice  in sub-monolayer Fe on Ir(111)</h3>

<i>Mingming Shuai, Yulong Yang, Haiming Huang, Rui Song, Yi Zhu, Yanghui Liao, Yinyan Zhu, Xiaodong Zhou, Lifeng Yin, Jian Shen</i>
<br>
<br>
Room temperature grown Fe monolayer (ML) on the Ir(111) single crystal
substrate has attracted great research interests as nano-skyrmion lattice can
form under proper growth conditions. The formation of the nanoscale skyrmion,
however, appears to be greatly affected by the diffusion length of the Fe
adatoms on the Ir(111) surface. We made this observation by employing
spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy to study skyrmion formation upon
systematically changing the impurity density on the substrate surface prior to
Fe deposition. Since the substrate surface impurities serve as pinning centers
for Fe adatoms, the eventual size and shape of the Fe islands exhibit a direct
correlation with the impurity density, which in turn determines whether
skyrmion can be formed. Our observation indicates that skyrmion only forms when
the impurity density is below 0.006/nm2, i.e., 12 nm averaged spacing between
the neighboring defects. We verify the significance of Fe diffusion length by
growing Fe on clean Ir(111) substrate at low temperature of 30 K, where no
skyrmion was observed to form. Our findings signify the importance of diffusion
of Fe atoms on the Ir(111) substrate, which affects the size, shape and lattice
perfection of the Fe islands and thus the formation of skyrmion lattice.

<h3>Flexoelectricity-stabilized ferroelectric phase with enhanced  reliability in ultrathin La:HfO2 films</h3>

<br>
<br>
Doped HfO2 thin films exhibit robust ferroelectric properties even for
nanometric thicknesses, are compatible with current Si technology and thus have
great potential for the revival of integrated ferroelectrics. Phase control and
reliability are core issues for their applications. Here we show that, in
(111)-oriented 5%La:HfO2 (HLO) epitaxial thin films deposited on
(La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O3 substrates, the flexoelectric effect, arising from
the strain gradient along the films normal, induces a rhombohedral distortion
in the otherwise Pca21 orthorhombic structure. Density functional calculations
reveal that the distorted structure is indeed more stable than the pure Pca21
structure, when applying an electric field mimicking the flexoelectric field.
This rhombohedral distortion greatly improves the fatigue endurance of HLO thin
films by further stabilizing the metastable ferroelectric phase against the
transition to the thermodynamically stable non-polar monoclinic phase during
repetitive cycling. Our results demonstrate that the flexoelectric effect,
though negligibly weak in bulk, is crucial to optimize the structure and
properties of doped HfO2 thin films with nanometric thicknesses for integrated
ferroelectric applications.

<h3>The key role of non-local screening in the environment-insensitive  exciton fine structures of transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11177" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11177</a>
<br>
<i>Wei-Hua Li, Jhen-Dong Lin, Ping-Yuan Lo, Guan-Hao Peng, Ching-Yu Hei, Shao-Yu Chen, Shun-Jen Cheng</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical and computational
investigation of exciton fine structures of WSe$_2$-monolayers, one of the best
known two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD's), in various
dielectric-layer environments by solving the first-principles-based
Bethe-Salpeter equation. While the physical and electronic properties of
atomically thin nano-materials are normally sensitive to the variation of
surrounding environment, our studies reveal that the influence of dielectric
environment on the exciton fine structures of TMD-ML's is surprisingly limited.
We point out that the non-locality of Coulomb screening plays a key role to
suppress the factor of dielectric environment and drastically shrink the fine
structure splittings between bright exciton (BX) states and various dark
exciton (DX) states of TMD-ML's. The intriguing non-locality of screening in 2D
materials can be manifested by the measurable {\it non-linear} correlation
between the BX-DX splittings and exciton binding energies with varying the
surrounding dielectric environments. The revealed environment-insensitive
exciton fine structures of TMD-ML's suggest the robustness of prospective
dark-exciton-based opto-electronics against the inevitable variation of
inhomogeneous dielectric environment.

<h3>Magnons in the fan phase of anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
Elementary excitations spectrum of the fan phase of anisotropic frustrated
antiferromagnets is discussed analytically. In the linear spin-wave
approximation, the spectrum is determined by the Hamiltonian, including normal,
anomalous, and umklapp terms. The latter mix states with momenta which differ
by two modulation vectors of the fan structure. This mixing leads to essential
rearrangement of the low-energy part of the spectrum, which is shown to consist
of a gapless phason branch with linear dispersion and a gapped ``optical''
branch, which corresponds to the fan structure amplitude oscillations. In the
high-energy part of the spectrum, the effect of the umklapps is negligible, and

Spin carriers subject to Dresselhaus [110] (D110) spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
gather null spin phases in closed circuits, contrary to usual Rashba and
Dresselhaus [001] SOC. We show that D110 spin phases can be activated in square
circuits by introducing an in-plane Zeeman field, where localized field
inhomogeneities act as effective spin-scattering centers. Our simulations show
rich interference patterns in the quantum conductance, which work as maps for a
geometric classification of the propagating spin states. We also find that
disorder allows for valuable low-field implementations.

<br>
High-frequency transport in the edge states of the quantum spin Hall (QSH)
effect has to date rarely been explored, though it could cast light on the
scattering mechanisms taking place therein. We here report on the measurement
of the plasmon velocity in topological HgTe quantum wells both in the QSH and
quantum Hall (QH) regimes, using harmonic GHz excitations and phase-resolved
detection. We observe low plasmon velocities corresponding to large transverse
widths, which we ascribe to the prominent influence of charge puddles forming
in the vicinity of edge channels. Together with other recent works, it suggests
that puddles play an essential role in the edge state physics and probably
constitute a main hurdle on the way to clean and robust edge transport.

<h3>Neural Network Analytic Continuation for Monte Carlo: Improvement by  Statistical Errors</h3>

This study explores the use of neural network-based analytic continuation to
extract spectra from Monte Carlo data. We apply this technique to both
synthetic and Monte Carlo-generated data. The training sets for neural networks
are carefully synthesized without ``data leakage". We found that the training
set should match the input correlation functions in terms of statistical error
properties, such as noise level, noise dependence on imaginary time, and
imaginary time-displaced correlations. We have developed a systematic method to
synthesize such training datasets. Our improved algorithm outperform the widely
used maximum entropy method in highly noisy situations. As an example, our
method successfully extracted the dynamic structure factor of the spin-1/2
Heisenberg chain from quantum Monte Carlo simulations.

We numerically study a mesoscopic system consisting of magnetic nanorings in
the presence of thermal magnetization fluctuations. We find the formation of
dipolar-field-mediated ``bonds" promoting the formation of annuli clusters,
where the amount of bonds between two rings varies between zero and two. This
system resembles the formation of polymers from artificial atoms, which in our
case are the annuli and where the valency of the atom is set by the ring
multipolarity. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the resulting
structures, and find a transition associated with the formation of the bonds.
In addition, we find that the system has a tendency to form topological
structures, with a distinct critical temperature in relation to the one for
bond formation.

<h3>The internal clock of many-body (de-)localization</h3>

After a decade of many claims to the opposite, there now is a growing
consensus that generic disordered quantum wires, e.g. the XXZ-Heisenberg chain,
do not exhibit many-body localization (MBL) - at least not in a strict sense
within a reasonable window of disorder values $W$. Specifically, computational
studies of short wires exhibit an extremely slow but unmistakable flow of
physical observables with increasing time and system size (``creep") that is
consistently directed away from (strict) localization. Our work sheds fresh
light on delocalization physics: Strong sample-to-sample fluctuations indicate
the absence of a generic time scale, i.e. of a naive ``clock rate"; however,
the concept of an ``internal clock" survives, at least in an ensemble sense.
Specifically, we investigate the relaxation of the imbalance $\mathcal{I}(t)$
and its temporal fluctuations $\mathcal{F}(t)$, the entanglement and Renyi
entropies, $\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{e}}(t)$ and $ \mathcal{S}_2(t)$, in a 1D
system of interacting disordered fermions. We observe that adopting
$\mathcal{S}_{\mathrm{e}}(t), \mathcal{S}_2(t)$ as a measure for the internal
time per sample reduces the sample-to-sample fluctuations but does not
eliminate them. However, a (nearly) perfect collapse of the average
$\overline{\mathcal{I}}(t)$ and $\overline{\mathcal{F}}(t)$ for different $W$
is obtained when plotted against $\overline{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{e}}(t)$ or
$\overline{\mathcal{S}}_2(t)$, indicating that the average entropy
appropriately models the ensemble-averaged internal clock. We take the tendency
for faster-than-logarithmic growth of $\overline{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathrm{e}}(t)$
together with smooth dependency on $W$ of all our observables within the entire
simulation window as support for the cross-over scenario, discouraging an MBL
transition within the traditional parametric window of computational studies.

<h3>Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of Strongly Correlated Mott  Insulators: Signature of the Creation and Annihilation of Double Occupancy</h3>

We applied the time-resolved attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to
systematically investigate ultrafast optical responses of condensed matter
systems. Under an intense pump pulse, absorption spectra indicate that the
non-interacting electrons of band insulators produce a field-induced redshift,
known as the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, as commonly expected. In contrast
to the band insulators, in Mott insulators, unconventional spectra are observed
which do not fully reflect the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect. While it still
exhibits the fishbone-like structures mimicking the dynamical Franz-Keldysh
effect, the spectra show a negative difference absorption below the band edge,
rendering a blueshift. In addition, the decomposed difference absorption
reveals the creation and the annihilation of double occupancy mainly contribute
to the negative signal, implying that the unconventional spectra are purely
driven by the electron-correlations. These demonstrations of unconventional
responses would guide us to the correlation-embedded attosecond electron
dynamics in condensed matter systems.

We report the slow-light enhanced spin-resolved in-plane emission from a
single quantum dot (QD) in a photonic crystal waveguide (PCW). The slow light
dispersions in PCWs are designed to match the emission wavelengths of single
QDs. The resonance between two spin states emitted from a single QD and a slow
light mode of a waveguide is investigated under a magnetic field with Faraday
configuration. Two spin states of a single QD experience different degrees of
enhancement as their emission wavelengths are shifted by combining diamagnetic
and Zeeman effects with an optical excitation power control. A circular
polarization degree up to 0.81 is achieved by changing the off-resonant
excitation power. Strongly polarized photon emission enhanced by a slow light
mode shows great potential to attain controllable spin-resolved photon sources
for integrated optical quantum networks on chip.

<h3>Cooperative melting in double-stranded peptide chains through local  mechanical interactions</h3>

Under an external field a double-stranded peptide chain can separate in a
fragile or ductile transition. It is usually believed that these two regimes
are driven either by chemical and thermal fields, or through non-local
mechanical interactions. Here, we show explicitly that local mechanical
interactions regulates the stability and reversibility of the
cooperative/non-cooperative melting transition, which is described by a single
parameter depending on an internal length scale. Our theory is applicable to a
wide range of biological examples such as DNA, protein secondary structures,
and the microtubules and tau proteins, for which we are able to predict the
critical melting force as a function of the chain length.

MemComputing is a new model of computation that exploits the non-equilibrium
property-we call 'memory'-of any physical system to respond to external
perturbations by keeping track of how it has reacted at previous times. Its
digital, scalable version maps a finite string of symbols into a finite string
of symbols. In this paper, I will discuss some analogies of the operation of
MemComputing machines-in general, and digital in particular-with a few physical
properties of the biological brain. These analogies could be a source of
inspiration to improve on the design of these machines. In turn, they could
suggest new directions of study in (computational) neuroscience.

<h3>A geometrical description of charge distribution on the disordered  conductor surfaces</h3>

This paper considers the distribution of charge over the surface of a
conductor, and specifically the old rule-of-thumb that charge accumulates near
sharp points and more generally in regions of high curvature. The discussion is
almost entirely qualitative. Various conductors with different geometric shapes
have been considered and the charge density on their points has been compared.
Our discussion shows that the statement "surface charge density is higher at
points with greater curvature" does not seem to be true and at least it can be
modified. We have avoided unnecessary relationships as much as possible and
tried to follow the discussion qualitatively.

As a typical 2D magnetic material with self-intercalated structure, Cr5Te8
exhibits many fascinating magnetic properties. Although the ferromagnetism of
2D Cr5Te8 has been reported, the study of its magnetic domain is still blank.
Herein, we successfully fabricated 2D Cr5Te8 nanosheets with controlled
thickness and lateral size by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then magnetic
property measurement system suggested Cr5Te8 nanosheets possessing intense
out-of-plane ferromagnetism with the Curie temperature of 179 K. Most
importantly, we found magnetic bubbles and thickness-dependent maze-like
magnetic domains by cryogenic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) for the first
time. The domain width of the maze-like magnetic domains increases rapidly with
decreasing sample thickness, while domain contrast decreases. This indicates
dipolar interaction is the dominant role over exchange interaction and magnetic
anisotropy. Our work not only paves a way for the controllable growth of 2D
magnetic materials, but also suggests new directions for controlling magnetic
phases and systematically adjusting domain properties.

<h3>Influence of Gd-rich precipitates on the martensitic transformation,  magnetocaloric effect and mechanical properties of Ni-Mn-In Heusler alloys --  A comparative study</h3>

A multi-stimuli cooling cycle can be used to increase the cyclic caloric
performance of multicaloric materials like Ni-Mn-In Heusler alloys. However,
the use of a uniaxial compressive stress as an additional external stimulus to
a magnetic field requires good mechanical stability. Improvement of mechanical
stability and strength by doping has been shown in several studies. However,
doping is always accompanied by grain refinement and a change in transition
temperature. This raises the question of the extent to which mechanical
strength is related to grain refinement, transition temperature, or
precipitates. This study shows a direct comparison between a single-phase
Ni-Mn-Sn and a two-phase Gd-doped Ni-Mn-In alloy with the same transition
temperature and grain size. It is shown that the excellent magnetocaloric
properties of the Ni-Mn-In matrix are maintained with doping. The isothermal
entropy change and adiabatic temperature change are reduced by only 15% in the
two-phase Ni-Mn-In-Heusler alloy compared to the single-phase alloy, which is
resulting from a slight increase in thermal hysteresis and the width of the
transition. Due to the same grain size and transition temperature, this effect
can be directly related to the precipitates. The introduction of Gd
precipitates leads to a 100% improvement in mechanical strength, which is
significantly lower than the improvement observed for Ni-Mn-In alloys with
grain refinement and Gd precipitates. This reveals that a significant
contribution to the improved mechanical stability in Gd-doped Heusler alloys is
related to grain refinement.

<h3>Unveiling the impact of temperature on magnon diffuse scattering  detection in scanning transmission electron microscopy</h3>

<br>
<br>
Magnon diffuse scattering (MDS) signals could be studied with high spatial
resolution in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), thanks to
recent technological progress in electron energy loss spectroscopy. However,
detecting MDS signals in STEM is challenging due to their overlap with the
stronger thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) signals. In bcc Fe at 300~K, MDS
signals greater than or comparable to TDS signals occur under the central Bragg
disk, into a currently inaccesible energy-loss region. Therefore, to detect MDS
in STEM, it is necessary to identify conditions in which TDS and MDS signals
can be distinguished from one another. Temperature may be a key factor due to
the distinct thermal signatures of magnon and phonon signals. In this work, we
present a study on the effects of temperature on MDS and TDS in bcc Fe --
considering a detector outside the central Bragg disk -- using the frozen
phonon and frozen magnon multislice methods. Our study reveals that neglecting
the effects of atomic vibrations causes the MDS signal to grow approximately
linearly up to the Curie temperature of Fe, after which it exhibits less
variation. The MDS signal displays an alternating behavior due to dynamical
diffraction, instead of increasing monotonically as a function of thickness.
The inclusion of the Debye-Waller factor (DWF) causes the linear growth of the
MDS signal to change to an oscillatory behavior that exhibits a predominant
peak for each thickness, which increases and shifts to higher temperatures as
the thickness increases. In contrast, the TDS signal grows more linearly than
the MDS signal (with DWF) but still exhibits dynamical diffraction effects. An
analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) shows that the MDS signal can be a
statistically significant contribution to the total scattering intensity under
realistic measurement conditions and reasonable acquisition times.

<h3>Entanglement entropy of higher rank topological phases</h3>

We study entanglement entropy of unusual $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological
stabilizer codes which admit fractional excitations with restricted mobility
constraint in a manner akin to fracton topological phases. It is widely known
that the sub-leading term of the entanglement entropy of a disk geometry in
conventional topologically ordered phases is related to the total number of the
quantum dimension of the fractional excitations. We show that, in our model,
such a relation does not hold, i.e, the total number of the quantum dimension
varies depending on the system size, whereas the sub-leading term of the
entanglement entropy takes a constant number irrespective to the system size.
We give a physical interpretation of this result in the simplest case of the
model.

The illustrative wave function for a quantum disentangled liquid (QDL)
composed of light and heavy particles is examined within numerical simulations.
Initial measurement on light particles gives rise to the volume law of the
entanglement entropy of the heavy particles subsystem. The entropy reaches its
maximum value as the ratio of the system to subsystem sizes increases. The
standard deviation of entanglement entropy from its thermodynamic limit due to
the initial configuration of the light particle is diminished within ensemble
averaging. We have introduced a quantum circuit to simulate the underlying QDL
state. The results of the quantum simulation are in agreement with the
numerical simulations which confirms that the introduced circuit realizes a QDL
state.

<br>
<br>
Twisting bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) gives rise to a
periodic moir\'{e} potential resulting in flat electronic bands with localized
wavefunctions and enhanced correlation effects. In this work, scanning
tunneling microscopy is used to image a WS$_{2}$ bilayer twisted approximately
$3^{\circ}$ off the antiparallel alignment. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy
reveals the presence of localized electronic states in the vicinity of the
valence band onset. In particular, the onset of the valence band is observed to
occur first in regions with a Bernal stacking in which S atoms are located on
top of each other. In contrast, density-functional theory calculations on
twisted bilayers which have been relaxed in vacuum predict the highest lying
flat valence band to be localized in regions of AA' stacking. However,
agreement with the experiment is recovered when the calculations are carried
out on bilayers in which the atomic displacements from the unrelaxed positions
have been reduced reflecting the influence of the substrate and finite
temperature. This demonstrates the delicate interplay of atomic relaxations and
the electronic structure of twisted bilayer materials.

We study the band structures and the associated contact points for a
phosphorene superlattice made up of two periodic areas. We use the boundary
conditions to extract an equation describing the dispersion relation after
obtaining the eigen-wavefunctions. We show that energy transforms into linear
behavior near contact points, and fermions move at different speeds along $x$-
and $y$- directions. It was discovered that the periodic potential caused
additional Dirac points, which we located in $k$-space by establishing their
positions. We demonstrate that the barrier height and width can be used to
adjust the energy gap and modify the contact points. It might be that our
findings will be useful in the development of phosphorene-based electronic
devices.

We numerically demonstrate the excitation of leaky spin waves (SWs) guided
along a ferromagnetic stripe by an obliquely incident SW beam on the thin film
edge placed below the stripe. During propagation, leaky waves emit energy back
to the layer in the form of plane waves and several laterally shifted parallel
SW beams. This resonance excitation, combined with interference effects of the
reflected and re-emitted waves, results in the magnonic Woods anomaly and
significant increase of the Goos-Hanchen shift magnitude. Hence, we provide a
unique platform to control SW reflection and to transfer SWs from a 2D platform
into the 1D guiding mode that can be used to form a transdimensional magnonic
router.

When driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations, particle systems may display
phase transitions and physical behaviour with no equilibrium counterpart. We
study a two-dimensional particle model initially proposed to describe driven
non-Brownian suspensions undergoing nonequilibrium absorbing phase transitions.
We show that when the transition occurs at large density, the dynamics produces
long-range crystalline order. In the ordered phase, long-range translational
order is observed because equipartition of energy is lacking, phonons are
suppressed, and density fluctuations are hyperuniform. Our study offers an
explicit microscopic model where nonequilibrium violations of the Mermin-Wagner
theorem stabilize crystalline order in two dimensions.

temperatures. The tantalizing possibility that such experiments may one day be
able to probe physics of quantum objects with masses approaching the Plank mass
