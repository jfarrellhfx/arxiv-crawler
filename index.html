<h3>Chromium-Doped Bismuth Antimony Telluride for Future Quantum Hall Resistance Standards</h3>

Since 2017, epitaxial graphene has been the base material for the US national
standard for resistance. A future avenue of research within electrical
metrology is to remove the need for strong magnetic fields, as is currently the
case for devices exhibiting the quantum Hall effect. The quantum Hall effect is
just one of many research endeavours that revolve around recent quantum
physical phenomena like composite fermions, charge density waves, and
topological properties [1-2]. New materials, like magnetically doped
topological insulators (MTIs), offer access to the quantum anomalous Hall
effect, which in its ideal form, could become a future resistance standard
needing only a small permanent magnet to activate a quantized resistance value
[3-5]. Furthermore, these devices could operate at zero-field for measurements,
making the dissemination of the ohm more economical and portable. Here we
present results on precision measurements of the h/e2 quantized plateau of
Cr-Doped (BixSb1-x)2Te3 and give them context by comparing them to modern
graphene-based resistance standards. Ultimately, MTI-based devices could be
combined in a single system with magnetic-field-averse Josephson voltage
standards to obtain an alternative quantum current standard.

<h3>Aspects of univalence in holographic axion models</h3>

Univalent functions are complex, analytic (holomorphic) and injective
functions that have been widely discussed in complex analysis. It was recently
proposed that the stringent constraints that univalence imposes on the growth
of functions combined with sufficient analyticity conditions could be used to
derive rigorous lower and upper bounds on hydrodynamic dispersion relation,
i.e., on all terms appearing in their convergent series representations. The
result are exact bounds on physical quantities such as the diffusivity and the
speed of sound. The purpose of this paper is to further explore these ideas,
investigate them in concrete holographic examples, and work towards a better
intuitive understanding of the role of univalence in physics. More concretely,
we study diffusive and sound modes in a family of holographic axion models and
offer a set of observations, arguments and tests that support the applicability
of univalence methods for bounding physical observables described in terms of
effective field theories. Our work provides insight into expected `typical'
regions of univalence, comparisons between the tightness of bounds and the
corresponding exact values of certain quantities characterising transport,
tests of relations between diffusion and bounds that involve chaotic
pole-skipping, as well as tests of a condition that implies the conformal bound
on the speed of sound and a complementary condition that implies its violation.
