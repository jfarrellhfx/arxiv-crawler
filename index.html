<h3>Ergodicity breaking provably robust to arbitrary perturbations</h3>

We present a new route to ergodicity breaking via Hilbert space fragmentation
that displays an unprecedented level of robustness. Our construction relies on
a single emergent (prethermal) conservation law. In the limit when the
conservation law is exact, we prove the emergence of Hilbert space
fragmentation with an exponential number of frozen configurations. We further
prove that every frozen configuration is absolutely stable to arbitrary
perturbations, to all finite orders in perturbation theory. In particular, our
proof is not limited to symmetric perturbations, or to perturbations with
compact support, but also applies to perturbations with long-range tails, and
even to arbitrary geometrically nonlocal $k$-body perturbations, as long as
$k/L \rightarrow 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, where $L$ is linear system
size. Additionally, we identify one-form $U(1)$ charges characterizing some
non-frozen sectors, and discuss the dynamics starting from typical initial
conditions, which we argue is best interpreted in terms of the
magnetohydrodynamics of the emergent one-form symmetry.

<h3>Playing with Active Matter</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04168" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04168</a>

In the last 20 years, active matter has been a very successful research
field, bridging the fundamental physics of nonequilibrium thermodynamics with
applications in robotics, biology, and medicine. This field deals with active
particles, which, differently from passive Brownian particles, can harness
energy to generate complex motions and emerging behaviors. Most active-matter
experiments are performed with microscopic particles and require advanced
microfabrication and microscopy techniques. Here, we propose some macroscopic
experiments with active matter employing commercially available toy robots,
i.e., the Hexbugs. We demonstrate how they can be easily modified to perform
regular and chiral active Brownian motion. We also show that Hexbugs can
interact with passive objects present in their environment and, depending on
their shape, set them in motion and rotation. Furthermore, we show that, by
introducing obstacles in the environment, we can sort the robots based on their
motility and chirality. Finally, we demonstrate the emergence of Casimir-like
activity-induced attraction between planar objects in the presence of active
particles in the environment.

<h3>Rapid oxygen exchange between hematite and water vapor</h3>

<br>
Oxygen exchange at oxide/liquid and oxide/gas interfaces is important in
technology and environmental studies, as it is closely linked to both catalytic
activity and material degradation. The atomic-scale details are mostly unknown,
however, and are often ascribed to poorly defined defects in the crystal
lattice. Here we show that even thermodynamically stable, well-ordered surfaces
can be surprisingly reactive. Specifically, we show that all the 3-fold
coordinated lattice oxygen atoms on a defect-free single-crystalline r-cut
(1-102) surface of hematite ({\alpha}-Fe2O3) are exchanged with oxygen from
surrounding water vapor within minutes at temperatures below 70 {\deg}C, while
the atomic-scale surface structure is unperturbed by the process. A similar
behavior is observed after liquid water exposure, but the experimental data
clearly show most of the exchange happens during desorption of the final
monolayer, not during immersion. Density functional theory computations show
that the exchange can happen during on-surface diffusion, where the cost of the
lattice oxygen extraction is compensated by the stability of an HO-HOH-OH
complex. Such insights into lattice oxygen stability are highly relevant for
many research fields ranging from catalysis and hydrogen production to
geochemistry and paleoclimatology.

<h3>CO oxidation by Pt2/Fe3O4: metastable dimer and support configurations  facilitate lattice oxygen extraction</h3>

<br>
Heterogeneous catalysts based on sub-nanometer metal clusters often exhibit
strongly size-dependent properties, and the addition or removal of a single
atom can make all the difference. Identifying the most active species and
deciphering the reaction mechanism is extremely difficult, however, because it
is often not clear how the catalyst evolves in operando. Here, we utilize a
combination of atomically resolved scanning probe microscopies, spectroscopic
techniques, and density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to study CO
oxidation by a model Pt/Fe3O4(001) single-atom catalyst. We demonstrate that
(PtCO)2 dimers, formed dynamically through the agglomeration of mobile
Pt-carbonyl species, catalyse a reaction involving the oxide support to form
CO2. Pt2 dimers produce one CO2 molecule before falling apart into two adatoms,
releasing the second CO. Interestingly, Olattice extraction only becomes facile
when both the Pt-dimer and the Fe3O4 support can access metastable
configurations, suggesting that substantial, concerted rearrangements of both
cluster and support must be considered for reactions occurring at elevated
temperature.

The field of single atom catalysis (SAC) has expanded greatly in recent
years. While there has been much success developing new synthesis methods, a
fundamental disconnect exists between most experiments and the theoretical
computations used to model them. The real catalysts are based on powder
supports, which inevitably contain a multitude of different facets, different
surface sites, defects, hydroxyl groups, and other contaminants due to the
environment. This makes it extremely difficult to determine the structure of
the active SAC site using current techniques. To be tractable, computations
aimed at modelling SAC utilize periodic boundary conditions and low index
facets of an idealized support. Thus the reaction barriers and mechanisms
determined computationally represent, at best, a plausibility argument, and
there is a strong chance that some critical aspect is omitted. One way to
better understand what is plausible is by experimental modelling, i.e.
comparing the results of computations to experiments based on precisely defined
single-crystalline supports prepared in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment.
In this article, we review the status of the surface science literature as it
pertains to SAC. We focus on experimental work on supports where the site of
the metal atom are unambiguously determined from experiment, in particular the
surfaces of rutile and anatase TiO2, the iron oxides Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, as well
as CeO2 and MgO. Much of this work is based on scanning probe microscopy in
conjunction with spectroscopy, and we highlight the remarkably few studies in
which metal atoms are stable on low index surfaces of typical supports. In a
perspective, we discuss the possibility for expanding such studies into other
relevant supports.

<h3>Pychastic: Precise Brownian Dynamics using Taylor-Itō integrators in  Python</h3>

<br>
In the last decade, Python-powered physics simulations ecosystem has been
growing steadily, allowing greater interoperability, and becoming an important
tool in numerical exploration of physical phenomena, particularly in soft
matter systems. Driven by the need for fast and precise numerical integration
in colloidal dynamics, here we formulate the problem of Brownian Dynamics (BD)
in a mathematically consistent formalism of the It\=o calculus, and develop a
Python package to assist numerical computations. We show that, thanks to the
automatic differentiation packages, the classical truncated Taylor-It\=o
integrators can be implemented without the burden of computing the derivatives
of the coefficient functions beforehand. Furthermore, we show how to circumvent
the difficulties of BD simulations such as calculations of the divergence of
the mobility tensor in the diffusion equation and discontinuous trajectories
encountered when working with dynamics on $S^2$ and $SO(3)$. The resulting
Python package, Pychastic, is capable of performing BD simulations including
hydrodynamic interactions at speeds comparable to dedicated implementations in
lower-level programming languages, but with a much simpler end-user interface.

<h3>Minimal model of an active solid deviates from equilibrium mechanics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04341" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04341</a>
<br>
<i>Mario Sandoval</i>
<br>
In this work, the mechanical response oF an one-dimensional active solid --
defined as a network of active stochastic particles interacting by nonlinear
hard springs -- subject to an external deformation force, is numerically
studied and rationalized with a minimal model. It is found that an active solid
made of linear springs and subject to an external stress, presents an average
deformation which is independent of the system's activity. However, when the
active solid is made of nonlinear hard springs, the solid's average deformation
decreases with respect to a passive system under the same conditions, and as a
function of activity and rotational noise in the system. The latter result may
shed light on new ways to creating an active metamaterial, which could tune its
stiffness by moving either its activity or rotational noise.

<h3>What is wrong with the image charge force of keV ions in insulating  nano-capillaries</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04428" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04428</a>
<br>
<i>Erix Giglio</i>
<br>
In nano-capillaries of large aspect ratio, the attractive image charge force
is strong enough to affect the trajectory of ions passing through capillaries
and consequently to diminish the fraction of transmitted beam ions. We
calculated the theoretically transmitted fraction, using an approached but
CPU-friendly expression of the image charge force valid in the case of a static
ion and an infinite cylindrical dielectric interface. When comparing the
theoretically transmitted fraction to available experimental data for
nano-capillaries with an inner diameter of less than 200 nm, we found a
surprisingly large disagreement, i.e., the theoretically transmitted fractions
were easily an order of magnitude lower than the experimental ones. Noting that
the image charge force depends on the velocity of the ion via the frequency
dependent relative permittivity of the insulator, we investigated whether the
disagreement could be lifted using a velocity depend image charge force. We
give the exact expressions of the dynamical image charge force for a plane and
cylindrical dielectric interface as a function of the ion velocity. We then
re-evaluated the theoretically transmitted fractions in the case of SiO$_2$ and
PET dielectric interfaces. Our findings are discussed in the light of the
available experimental data.

<h3>Bulk-boundary correspondence for interacting Floquet systems in two  dimensions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03975" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03975</a>
<br>
<i>Carolyn Zhang, Michael Levin</i>
<br>
We present a method for deriving bulk and edge invariants for interacting,
many-body localized Floquet systems in two spatial dimensions. This method is
based on a general mathematical object which we call a flow. As an application
of our method, we derive bulk invariants for Floquet systems without symmetry,
as well as for systems with $U(1)$ symmetry. We also derive new formulations of
previously known single-particle and many-body invariants. For bosonic systems
without symmetry, our invariant gives a bulk counterpart of the rational-valued
GNVW index $\frac{p}{q}$ quantifying transport of quantum information along the
edge.

<h3>Dynamics and transport in the boundary-driven dissipative Klein-Gordon  chain</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03977" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03977</a>
<br>
<i>Abhinav Prem, Vir B. Bulchandani, S. L. Sondhi</i>
<br>
Motivated by experiments on chains of superconducting qubits, we consider the
dynamics of a classical Klein-Gordon chain coupled to coherent driving and
subject to dissipation solely at its boundaries. As the strength of the
boundary driving is increased, this minimal classical model recovers the main
features of the "dissipative phase transition" seen experimentally. Between the
transmitting and non-transmitting regimes on either side of this transition
(which support ballistic and diffusive energy transport respectively), we
observe additional dynamical regimes of interest. These include a regime of
superdiffusive energy transport at weaker driving strengths, together with a
"dissipative breather crystal" regime at stronger driving strengths, which is
characterized by emergent translation symmetry, ballistic energy transport, and
coherent oscillations of a nonlinear normal mode. We propose a non-local
Lyapunov exponent as an experimentally measurable diagnostic of many-body chaos
in this system, and more generally in open systems that are only coupled to an
environment at their boundaries.

<h3>Interaction corrections to the thermopower of the disordered  two-dimensional electron gas</h3>

<br>
At low temperatures, the transport coefficients in the disordered electron
gas acquire quantum corrections as a result of the complex interplay of
disorder and interactions. The interaction corrections to the electric
conductivity have their origin in virtual processes with typical electronic
energies far exceeding the temperature. Here, we study interaction corrections
$\delta S$ to the thermopower $S$ of the two-dimensional disordered electron
gas with long-range Coulomb interactions. We show that while both real and
virtual processes contribute to these corrections, the real processes are
dominant and lead to a logarithmic temperature dependence of $\delta S/S$ with
$\delta S/S<0$.

<h3>Disorder Induced Anomalous Thermal Hall Effect in Chiral Phases of  Superfluid $^3$He</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04004" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04004</a>
<br>
<i>Priya Sharma, Anton Vorontsov, J. A. Sauls</i>
<br>
NMR experiments on liquid $^3$He infused into uniaxially anisotropic silica
aerogels show the stabilisation of two equal-spin-pairing chiral phases on
cooling from the normal phase. The alignment of the chiral axis relative to the
anisotropy axis for these phases is predicted to depend upon temperature. A
chiral A-like phase is also stabilized when $^3$He is confined to a slab of
thickness $D\sim \xi$, the superfluid coherence length. For both types of
confinement, scattering of quasiparticles by the random potential - aerogel or
surface - is pair breaking and generates a sub-gap density of quasiparticle
states. The random field also conspires with the chiral order parameter to
generate skew scattering of quasiparticles in the plane normal to the chiral
axis. This scattering mechanism leads to anomalous thermal Hall transport for
nonequilibrium quasiparticles driven by a thermal gradient. We report
theoretical results for the longitudinal as well as anomalous thermal Hall
conductivity for theoretical models for chiral phases of $^3$He in both
anisotropic aerogel and slabs. The anomalous thermal Hall effect provides an
important tool to identify signatures of broken time-reversal and mirror
symmetries and topology in chiral superconductors/superfluids. We compare our
theoretical predictions with existing experimental measurements of thermal
transport in chiral phases of $^3$He.

<h3>Effects of the local chemical environment on vacancy diffusion in  multi-principal element alloys</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04010" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04010</a>
<br>
<i>Mauricio Ponga, Mohamed Hendy, Okan K. Orhan, Swarnava Ghosh</i>
<br>
Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) are exciting systems showing
remarkable properties compared to conventional materials due to their
exceedingly large compositional space and spatially varying chemical
environment. However, predicting fundamental properties from the local chemical
environment is challenging due to the large scale of the problem. To
investigate this fundamental problem, we employ a combination of atomistic
simulations (using ab-initio and molecular dynamics) and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to evaluate point defect and migration energies in an equimolar
CoFeCrNi MPEA. We show how energies of point defects can be predicted with
reasonable accuracy using a small subset of local chemical environments. Using
the CNNs, we develop a lattice Monte Carlo simulation that computes the
migration path and diffusivities of vacancies. Remarkably, our work illustrates
how the local chemical environment leads rise to a distribution function of the
point defect energies, which is responsible for the macroscopic diffusivity of
vacancies. In particular, we observed that vacancies get trapped in super
basins surrounded by large migration and connected with low migration energy
states. As a result, vacancy diffusivity is highly dependent on the environment
and could change several orders of magnitude for a given temperature. Our works
illustrate the importance of understanding properties in MPEAs depending on the
local chemical environment and the ability of CNN to provide a model for
computing energies in high-dimensional spaces, which can be used to scale
things up to higher-order models.

<h3>Size and quality of quantum mechanical data-set for training Neural  Network Force Fields for liquid water</h3>

<br>
Molecular dynamics simulations have been used in different scientific fields
to investigate a broad range of physical systems. However, the accuracy of
calculation is based on the model considered to describe the atomic
interactions. In particular, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) has the
accuracy of density functional theory (DFT), and thus is limited to small
systems and relatively short simulation time. In this scenario, Neural Network
Force Fields (NNFF) have an important role, since it provides a way to
circumvent these caveats. In this work we investigate NNFF designed at the
level of DFT to describe liquid water, focusing on the size and quality of the
training data-set considered. We show that structural properties are less
dependent on the size of the training data-set compared to dynamical ones (such
as the diffusion coefficient), and a good sampling (selecting data reference
for training process) can lead to a small sample with good precision.

<h3>Understanding magnetocrystalline anisotropy based on orbital and  quadrupole moments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04070" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04070</a>
<br>
<i>Yoshio Miura, Jun Okabayashi</i>
<br>
Understanding magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) is fundamentally important
for developing novel magnetic materials. Therefore, clarifying the relationship
between MCA and local physical quantities observed by spectroscopic
measurements, such as the orbital and quadrupole moments, is necessary. In this
review, we discuss MCA and the distortion effects in magnetic materials with
transition metals (TMs) based on the orbital and quadrupole moments, which are
related to the spin-conserving and spin-flip terms in the second-order
perturbation calculations, respectively. We revealed that orbital moment
stabilized the spin moment in the direction of the larger orbital moment, while
the quadrupole moment stabilized the spin moment along the longitudinal
direction of the spin-density distribution. The MCA of the magnetic materials
with TMs and their interfaces can be determined from the competition between
these two contributions. We showed that the perpendicular MCA of the
face-centered cubic (fcc) Ni with tensile tetragonal distortion arose from the
orbital moment anisotropy, whereas that of Mn-Ga alloys originated from the
quadrupole moment of spin density. In contrast, in the Co/Pd(111) multilayer
and Fe/MgO(001), both the orbital moment anisotropy and quadrupole moment of
spin density at the interfaces contributed to the perpendicular MCA.
Understanding the MCA of magnetic materials and interfaces based on orbital and
quadrupole moments is essential to design MCA of novel magnetic applications.

<h3>Excitonic density-waves, bi-excitons and orbital selective pairing in  two-orbital correlated chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04094" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04094</a>
<br>
<i>Chun Yang, Adrian E. Feiguin</i>
<br>
We present a comprehensive study of a one-dimensional two-orbital model at
and below quarter-filling that realizes a number of unconventional phases. In
particular, we find an excitonic density wave in which excitons quasi-condense
with finite center of mass momentum and an order parameter that changes phase
with wave-vector $Q$. In this phase, excitons behave as hard-core bosons
without charge order. In addition, excitons can pair to form bi-excitons in a
state that is close to a charge density-wave instability. When pairing
dominates over the inter-orbital repulsion, we encounter a regime in which one
orbital is metallic, while the other forms a spin gapped superconductor, a
genuine orbital selective paired state. All these results are supported by
both, analytical and numerical calculations. By assuming a quasi-classical
approximation, we solve the three-body hole-electron-spinon problem and show
that excitons are held together by forming a bound state with spinons. In order
to preserve the antiferromagnetic background, excitons acquire a dispersion
that has a minimum away from $k=0$. The full characterization of the different
phases is obtained by means of extensive density matrix renormalization group
calculations.

<h3>Regulating effect of biaxial strain on electronic, optical and  photocatalytic properties in promising X2PAs (X = Si, Ge and Sn) monolayers</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04099" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04099</a>

<br>
Photocatalytic water splitting is an effective way to obtain renewable clean
energy. The challenge is to design tunable photocatalyst to meet the needs in
different environments. At the same time, the oxygen and hydrogen evolution
reactions (OER and HER) on the photocatalyst should be separated, which will be
conducive to the separation of products. The electronic, optical and
photocatalytic properties of Janus X2PAs (X = Si, Ge and Sn) monolayers are
explored by first-principles calculation. All the strain-free X2PAs monolayers
exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties with suitable band edge positions
straddling the standard redox potential of water and large visible light
absorption coefficients (up to 105 cm-1). Interestingly, the intrinsic internal
electric field is favorable for separating photogenerated carriers to different
surfaces of the monolayer. It contributes to realize the OER and HER separated
on different sides of the monolayer. In particular, the energy band edge
positions of X2PAs monolayers can be well adjusted by biaxial strain. Then it
can effectively modulate photocatalytic reactions, suggesting X2PAs monolayers
can be a piezo-photocatalytic switch between the OER, HER and full-reaction of
redox for water splitting. This investigation not only highlights that the
photocatalyst X2PAs monolayers with the separated OER and HER can be
effectively tuned by the mechanical strain, but also provides a new strategy
for designing highly adaptable and tunable piezo-photocatalysts.

<h3>Steady helix states in a resonant XXZ Heisenberg model with  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04102" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04102</a>
<br>
<i>E. S. Ma, K. L. Zhang, Z. Song</i>
<br>
We systematically investigate possible helix states in XXZ Heisenberg model
with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. Exact solutions show that a set of
precession helix states can be constructed by deliberate superposition of
degenerate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian under the resonant condition. When a
non-Hermitian balance boundary term is imposed as a quenching action, the
quench dynamics shows that a steady helix state emerges from some easily
prepared initial states, including saturate and maximally mixed ferromagnetic
states, according to the analysis of perturbation method. The corresponding
dynamics for near resonant cases is also investigated numerically, indicating
the robustness of the scheme. Our findings highlight the cooperation of
non-Hermiticity and the DM interaction in quantum spin system, suggesting a way
for preparing steady helix state in non-Hermitian quantum spin system.

<h3>Triggering superconductivity, semiconducting states, and ternary valley  structure in graphene via functionalization with Si-N layers</h3>

<br>
Opening a band gap and realizing static valley control have been long sought
after in graphenebased two-dimensional (2D) materials. Motivated by the recent
success in synthesizing 2D materials passivated by Si-N layers, here, we
propose two new graphene-based materials, 2D C2SiN and CSiN, via
first-principles calculations. Monolayer C2SiN is metallic and realizes
superconductivity at low temperatures. Monolayer CSiN enjoys excellent
stability and mechanical property. It is a semiconductor with a ternary valley
structure for electron carriers. Distinct from existing valleytronic platforms,
these valleys can be controlled by applied uniaxial strain. The valley
polarization of carriers further manifest as a pronounced change in the
anisotropic conductivity, which can be detected in simple electric measurement.
The strong interaction effects also lead to large exciton binding energy and
enhance the optical absorption in the ultraviolet range. Our work opens a new
route to achieve superconductivity, ternary valley structure, and semiconductor
with enhanced optical absorption in 2D materials.

<h3>NMR verification of Dirac nodal lines in a single-component molecular  conductor</h3>

<br>
The Dirac nodal line (DNL) is a novel form of massless Dirac fermions that
reside along lines in momentum space. Here, we verify genuine DNLs in the
molecular material, [Ni(dmdt)$_2$], with the combined NMR experiments and
numerical simulations. The NMR spectral shift and spin-lattice relaxation rate
divided by temperature, $1/T_1T$, decrease linearly and quadratically with
temperature, respectively, and become constant at low temperatures, consistent
with slightly dispersive DNLs with small Fermi pockets. Comparison of these
results with model simulations of DNLs reveals the suppression of the Fermi
velocity and the enhancement of antiferromagnetic fluctuations due to electron
correlation as well as the influence of the Landau quantization. The present
study offers a demonstration to identify the DNL and evaluate the correlation
effect with NMR.

The Heisenberg-Kitaev (HK) model on various lattices have attracted a lot of
attention because they may lead to exotic states such as quantum spin liquid
and topological orders. The rare-earth-based kagome lattice (KL) compounds
$\rm{Mg_2RE_3Sb_3O_{14}}$ $\rm{(RE=Gd, Er)}$ and $\rm{(RE=Nd)}$ have ${\bf
q=0}$, $120^\circ$ order and canted ferromagnetic (CFM) order, respectively.
Interestingly, the HK model on the KL has the same ground state long-range
orders. In the theoretical phase diagram, the CFM phase resides in a continuous
parameter region and there is no phase change across special parameter points,
such as the Kitaev ferromagnetic (KFM) point, the ferromagnetic (FM) point and
its dual FM point. However, a ground state property cannot distinguish a system
with or without topological nontrivial excitations and related phase
transitions. Here, we study the topological magnon excitations and related
thermal Hall conductivity in the HK model on the KL with CFM order. The CFM
phase can be divided into two regions related by the Klein duality, with the
self dual KFM point as their boundary. We find that the scalar spin chirality
which is intrinsic in the CFM order changes sign across the KFM point. This
leads to the opposite Chern numbers of corresponding magnon bands in the two
regions, and also the sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity.

<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have great potential for use in future
electronics due to their atomically thin nature which withstands short channel
effects and thus enables better scalability. Device scaling is the process of
reducing all device dimensions to achieve higher device density in a certain
chip area. For 2D materials-based transistors, both the channel and contact
scalability must be investigated. The channel scalability of 2D materials has
been thoroughly investigated, confirming their resilience to short-channel
effects. However, systematic studies on contact scalability remain rare and the
current understanding of contact scaling in 2D FET is inconsistent and
oversimplified. Here we combine physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical
contact measurements to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D
field-effect transistors (FETs). The asymmetrical contact measurements directly
compare electron injection with different contact lengths while using the exact
same channel, eliminating channel-to-channel variations. Compared to devices
with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts)
exhibit larger variation, smaller drain currents at high drain-source voltages,
and a higher chance of showing early saturation and negative differential
resistance. Quantum transport simulations show that the transfer length of
Ni-MoS2 contacts can be as short as 5 nm. Our results suggest that charge
injection at the source contact is different from injection at the drain side:
scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain
contacts cannot. Furthermore, we clearly identified that the transfer length
depends on the quality of the metal-2D interface. The asymmetrical contact
measurements proposed here will enable further understanding of contact scaling
behavior at various interfaces.

We investigate gated trilayer graphene partially devoid of outer layers and
forming a system of two trilayers connected by a single layer of graphene. A
difference in the stacking order of trilayers leads to the appearance of
gapless states, one of which is mainly localized in the single graphene layer.
We demonstrate that by changing the value of the gate voltage applied to the
outer layers one can change the slope of E(k) of this state. As a consequence
the direction of current flowing in the single layer graphene can also be
changed, the effect that could be useful in practical applications.

Micromagnetic exchange is usually derived by performing the continuum limit
of the Heisenberg model on a cubic lattice, where the exchange integrals are
assumed to be identical for all nearest neighbors. This limitation normally
imposes the use of a microscopic theory to explain the appearance of higher
order magnetic interactions such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI). In this paper we combine graph- and gauge field- theory to
simultaneously account for the symmetries of the crystal, the effect of
spin-orbit coupling and their interplay on a micromagnetic level. We obtain a
micromagnetic theory accounting for the crystal symmetry constraints at all
orders in exchange and show how to successfully predict the form of
micromagnetic DMI in all 32 point groups.

The numerical simulation of metal cutting processes requires material data
for constitutive equations, which cannot be obtained with standard material
testing procedures. Instead, inverse identifications of material parameters
within numerical simulation models of the cutting experiment itself are
necessary. The intention of the present report is the provision of results of a
large scale experimental study of dry orthogonal cutting experiments of Ti6Al4V
(3.7165 Grade 5) and Ck45 (AISI 1045) along with their documentation and
interpretation. The process forces are evaluated and each cutting insert
geometry has been measured prior to the experiments to determine the cutting
edge radii for each experiment. The resulting chip forms are analysed and the
averaged chip thicknesses are determined. A material characterization is
performed, which includes microstructural investigations on the raw materials
and is reported together with tensile test results. The assembled data set can
be used for parameter identification when the experimental conditions are
reproduced in numerical simulations. The cutting test results are finally used
to derive coefficients for Kienzle's force model. The data is stored in the
pCloud and contains process force measurement data, cutting edge radii scans,
pictures of chip geometries and etched chips.

<h3>Evidence for suppression of collective magnetism in Fe-Ag granular  multilayers</h3>

<br>

<br>
Evidence for the suppression of collective magnetic behavior of dipolarly
interacting Fe nanoparticles is found in Fe-Ag granular multilayers.
Interaction of Fe particles located in neighboring Fe layers is studied as a
function of the nominal thickness of the Ag layer in between only two Fe
layers. The surprisingly increasing interaction with increasing Ag-layer
thickness, verified by memory-effect measurements, is explained by the
formation of pinholes in the Ag layer at small Ag thicknesses, allowing direct
ferromagnetic coupling between Fe particles in neighboring Fe layers which may
hinder the frustration of superspins favored by dipolar interactions. At larger
Ag thicknesses, the Ag layer is continuous without pinholes and frustration
leads to the appearance of the superspin-glass state. The effect of increasing
interactions correlates well with the growing deviation at low temperatures of
the measured field-cooled (FC) magnetization from the interaction-free FC curve
calculated by a model based on the relaxation of two-level systems. Similar
phenomenon is reported in a recently published paper (S\'anchez et al., Small
2022, 18, 2106762) where a dense nanoparticle system is studied. The collective
magnetic behavior of the particles due to dipolar interactions is suppressed
when the anisotropy energy of the individual particles exceeds a certain
threshold.

<br>
Oxide-supported single-atom catalysts are commonly modelled as a metal atom
substituting surface cation sites in a low-index surface. Adatoms with dangling
bonds will inevitably coordinate molecules from the gas phase, and adsorbates
such as water can affect both stability and catalytic activity. Here, we use
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), noncontact atomic force microscopy
(ncAFM), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to show that high densities
of single Rh adatoms are stabilized on alpha-Fe2O3(1-102) in the presence of
2x10^(-8) mbar of water at room temperature, in marked contrast to the rapid
sintering observed under UHV conditions. Annealing to 50 {\deg}C in UHV desorbs
all water from the substrate leaving only the OH groups coordinated to Rh, and
high-resolution ncAFM images provide a direct view into the internal structure.
We provide direct evidence of the importance of OH ligands in the stability of
single atoms, and argue that their presence should be assumed when modelling
SAC systems.

Compressed hydrogen-rich compounds have received extensive attention as
appealing contenders for superconductors, and further challenges are
maintaining the stability and superconductivity of hydrides at lower pressures.
In this work, we found several novel hydrides YZrH6, YZrH8 and YZrH12 with
excellent superconductivity in the Y-Zr-H ternary system. Interestingly, YZrH6
with an A15-type structure can maintain dynamic stability down to 0.01 GPa and
still with a critical temperature (Tc) of 16 K. YZrH8 and YZrH12 have high Tc
of 70 K and 183 K at 200 GPa and 160 GPa, respectively. The phonon modes
associated with H atoms contribute significantly to the electron-phonon
coupling, and the H-driven electronic density of states play an important role
in superconductivity. These findings highlight relationship between the
H-driven electronic density of states, electron-phonon coupling and the
superconductivity in a distinct class of hydrides, opening new avenues for
designing and optimizing new hydrogen-rich high temperature superconductors.

<br>
The electronic structure of NdTe$_3$ in the charge density wave phase (CDW)
is investigated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The combination
of high-quality crystals and careful surface preparation reveals subtle and
previously unobserved details in the Fermi surface topology, allowing an
interpretation of the rich and unexplained quantum oscillations in the rare
earth tritellurides RTe$_3$. In particular, several closed Fermi surface
elements can be observed that are related to CDW-induced replicas of the
original bands, leading to the curious situation in which a CDW does not only
remove Fermi surface elements but creates new ones that are observable in
transport experiments. Moreover, a large residual Fermi surface is found in the
CDW gap, very close to the position of the gapped normal-state Fermi surface.
Its area agrees very well with high-frequency quantum oscillations in NdTe$_3$
and its presence is explained by strong electron-phonon coupling combined with
the quasi one-dimensional character of the CDW. Finally, we identify the origin
of the low-frequency $\alpha$ quantum oscillations ubiquitous for the lighter R
elements in the RTe$_3$ family and responsible for the high mobility in these
compounds.

<br>
The interplay between Kondo screening, indirect magnetic interaction and
geometrical frustration is studied in the two-dimensional Kondo-necklace model
on the triangular lattice. Using infinite projected entangled pair states
(iPEPS), we compute the ground state as a function of the antiferromagnetic
local Kondo interaction $J_K$ and the Ising-type direct spin-spin interaction
$I_z$ . As opposed to previous studies, we do not find partial Kondo screening
(PKS) in the isotropic limit $I_z = 0$ but the same behavior as in the
unfrustrated case, i.e. a direct phase transition between the paradigmatic
phases of the Doniach competition: (i) a disordered phase consisting of local
spin-singlets at strong $J_K$ and (ii) a magnetically ordered phase at weak
$J_K$ . For $I_z > 0$, we find a PKS ground state but again in opposite to
previous studies, we find that the PKS ground state is in strong competition
with a second ground state candidate not found before. This state is
characterized by a strongly polarized central spin in each hexagon and its
anti-parallel, weakly polarized (i.e. partially screened) neighbors. We name it
central spin (CS) phase.

Continuum elasticity is a powerful tool applicable in a broad range of
physical systems and phenomena. Yet, understanding how and on what scales
material disorder may lead to the breakdown of continuum elasticity is not
fully understood. We show, based on recent theoretical developments and
extensive numerical computations, that disordered elastic networks near a
critical rigidity transition, such as strain-stiffened fibrous biopolymer
networks that are abundant in living systems, reveal an anomalous long-range
elastic response below a correlation length. This emergent anomalous
elasticity, which is non-affine in nature, is shown to feature a qualitatively
different multipole expansion structure compared to ordinary continuum
elasticity, and a slower spatial decay of perturbations. The potential degree
of universality of these results, their implications (e.g. for cell-cell
communication through biological extracellular matrices) and open questions are
briefly discussed.

<br>
The interplay of light and matter gives rise to intriguing cooperative
effects in quantum many-body systems. This is even true in thermal equilibrium,
where the electromagnetic field can hybridize with collective modes of matter,
and virtual photons can induce interactions in the solid. Here, we show how
these light-mediated interactions can be treated using the dynamical mean-field
theory formalism. We consider a minimal model of a two-dimensional material
that couples to a surface plasmon polariton mode of a metal-dielectric
interface. Within the mean-field approximation, the system exhibits a
ferroelectric phase transition that is unaffected by the light-matter coupling.
Bosonic dynamical mean-field theory provides a more accurate description and
reveals that the photon-mediated interactions enhance the ferroelectric order
and stabilize the ferroelectric phase.

Spectroscopies that probe electronic excitations from core levels into
unoccupied orbitals, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron energy
loss spectroscopy, are widely used to gain insight into the electronic and
chemical structure of materials. To support the interpretation of experimental
spectra, we assess the performance of a first-principles approach that combines
linear-response time-dependent density (TDDFT) functional theory with the
$\Delta$~self\nobreakdash-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) approach. In
particular, we first use TDDFT to calculate the core-level spectrum and then
shift the spectrum such that the lowest excitation energy from TDDFT agrees
with that from $\Delta$SCF. We apply this method to several small molecules and
find encouraging agreement between calculated and measured spectra.

<h3>Bulk Photovoltaic Effects in Halide Perovskites</h3>

<br>
The bulk photovoltaic effect allows generating photocurrents without the need
for semiconductor interfaces, provided the material has an asymmetric crystal
structure. Piezoelectrics have intrinsically asymmetric lattices and therefore
display bulk photovoltaic effects, but asymmetry can also be generated in
non-piezoelectric materials by bending them, thanks to the so-called
flexo-photovoltaic coupling. Yet the actual magnitude and relevance of this
effect for photovoltaic materials is not known. In this paper we report the
flexo-photovoltaic effect of two archetypal halide perovskites, MAPbBr3 and
MAPbI3, and find it to be many orders of magnitude higher than for the
reference flexoelectric SrTiO3, whose coefficient we also measure. In addition,
we find that MAPbI3 single crystals display hysteresis in open-circuit
photovoltage as a function of poling voltage so that, from a photovoltaic point
of view, this material is functionally ferroelectric. Last but not least, we
find that bulk photovoltaic effects can substantially modulate the photovoltaic
output of junction-based solar cells made with perovskite single crystals.

<br>
"Strange" correlators provide a tool to detect topological phases arising in
many-body models by computing the matrix elements of suitably defined two-point
correlations between the states under investigation and trivial reference
states. Their effectiveness depends on the choice of the adopted operators. In
this paper we give a systematic procedure for this choice, discussing the
advantages of choosing operators using the bulk-boundary correspondence of the
systems under scrutiny. Via the scaling exponents, we directly relate the
algebraic decay of the strange correlators with the scaling dimensions of
gapless edge modes operators. We begin our analysis with lattice models hosting
symmetry-protected topological phases and we analyze the sums of the strange
correlators, pointing out that integrating their moduli substantially reduces
cancellations and finite-size effects. We also analyze instances of systems
hosting intrinsic topological order, as well as strange correlators between
states with different nontrivial topologies. Our results for both translational
and non-translational invariant cases, and in presence of on-site disorder and
long-range couplings, extend the validity of the strange correlators approach
for the diagnosis of topological phases of matter, and indicate a general
procedure for their optimal choice.

We demonstrate a spin-wave-based time-multiplexed Ising Machine (SWIM),
implemented using a 5 $\mu$m thick Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film and
off-the-shelf microwave components. The artificial Ising spins consist of
34--68 ns long 3.125 GHz spinwave RF pulses with their phase binarized using a
phase-sensitive microwave amplifier. Thanks to the very low spinwave group
velocity, the 7 mm long YIG waveguide can host an 8-spin MAX-CUT problem and
solve it in less than 4 $\mu$s while consuming only 7 $\mu$J. Using a real-time
oscilloscope, we follow the temporal evolution of each spin as the SWIM
minimizes its energy and find both uniform and domain-propagation-like
switching of the spin state. The SWIM has the potential for substantial further
miniaturization, scalability, speed, and reduced power consumption, and may
become a versatile platform for commercially feasible optimization problem
solvers with high performance.

In this work we investigate the effect of a constant external, or artificial,
magnetic field on the nonlinear response of 2D Weyl materials. We calculate the
Landau Levels for tilted cones in 2D Weyl materials by treating the tilting in
a perturbative manner, and employ perturbation theory to calculate the
tilting-induced correction to the magnetic field induced Landau spectrum. We
then calculate the induced current as a function of the tilting coefficients
and extract the correspondent nonlinear signal. Then, we analyze how changing
tilting parameter affects nonlinear signal. Our findings show the possibility
of achieving a significant tunability of the nonlinear response, by suitably
engineering the orientation and degree of tilt of Dirac cones in 2D Weyl
materials.

<h3>Doping effects in high-harmonic generation from correlated systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Thomas Hansen, Lars Bojer Madsen</i>
<br>
Using the one-dimensional Hubbard model, which is commonly used for
describing, e.g., high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates, we study high-harmonic
generation (HHG) from doped, correlated materials. Doping is modeled by
changing the number of electrons in the lattice from the conventional
half-filling case. For relatively small Hubbard $U$, i.e., small
electron-electron correlation, we find little to no effect of doping on the
dynamics and the HHG spectra. For increasing $U$ the degree of doping has a
marked effect on the dynamics and spectra. We explain these findings through
the quasiparticle-based doublon-holon picture. The dynamics are separated into
two types, firstly doublon and holon movement, and, secondly, doublon-holon
pair creation and annihilation. Doping results in all configurations containing
doublons or holons. Those quasiparticles can move at no extra cost in energy
regardless of the correlation level. This motion at no energy cost increases
the high-harmonic gain for low and medium harmonic orders. We discuss that in
the high-$U$ limit, antiferromagnetic ordering becomes increasingly unlikely
with increasing doping rates and explain an associated drop in the high-order
harmonics relative to the case of half filling.

<br>
Magnetisation switching increases the temperature of potential devices, hence
finding non-thermal routes is crucial for future applications. By employing
atomistic spin-lattice dynamics simulations, we show efficient coherent
magnetisation switching triggered by THz phonon excitation in insulating single
species materials. The key ingredient is excitation near the P-point of the
spectrum in conditions where spins typically cannot be excited and when
manifold k phonon modes are accessible at the same frequency. Our model
predicts the necessary ingredients for low-dissipative switching and provides
new insight into THz-excited spin dynamics.

Quantum droplets are a quantum analogue to classical fluid droplets in that
they are self-bound and display liquid-like properties -- such as
incompressibility and surface tension -- though their stability is the result
of quantum fluctuations. One of the major systems for observing quantum
droplets is two-component Bose gases. To remain self-bound in free space,
two-component droplets must retain a fixed ratio between the densities of the
two fluids. The work presented here goes beyond this fixed density ratio by
investigating spherical droplets in imbalanced mixtures. This work finds that
these systems give rise to a droplet immersed in a background gas. By exploring
the breathing modes of these imbalanced mixtures, it is found that the droplet
can radiate particles into the surrounding gas, yielding an intricate
superposition of simultaneously decaying collective oscillations.

<h3>Critical properties of the Anderson transition in random graphs:  two-parameter scaling theory, Kosterlitz-Thouless type flow and many-body  localization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04337" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04337</a>

<i>Ignacio García-Mata, John Martin, Olivier Giraud, Bertrand Georgeot, Rémy Dubertrand, Gabriel Lemarié</i>
<br>
The Anderson transition in random graphs has raised great interest, partly
because of its analogy with the many-body localization (MBL) transition. Unlike
the latter, many results for random graphs are now well established, in
particular the existence and precise value of a critical disorder separating a
localized from an ergodic delocalized phase. However, the renormalization group
flow and the nature of the transition are not well understood. In turn, recent
works on the MBL transition have made the remarkable prediction that the flow
is of Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Here we show that the Anderson transition on
graphs displays the same type of flow. Our work attests to the importance of
rare branches along which wave functions have a much larger localization length
$\xi_\parallel$ than the one in the transverse direction, $\xi_\perp$.
Importantly, these two lengths have different critical behaviors:
$\xi_\parallel$ diverges with a critical exponent $\nu_\parallel=1$, while
$\xi_\perp$ reaches a finite universal value ${\xi_\perp^c}$ at the transition
point $W_c$. Indeed, $\xi_\perp^{-1} \approx {\xi_\perp^c}^{-1} + \xi^{-1}$,
with $\xi \sim (W-W_c)^{-\nu_\perp}$ associated with a new critical exponent
$\nu_\perp = 1/2$, where $\exp( \xi)$ controls finite-size effects. The
delocalized phase inherits the strongly non-ergodic properties of the critical
regime at short scales, but is ergodic at large scales, with a unique critical
exponent $\nu=1/2$. This shows a very strong analogy with the MBL transition:
the behavior of $\xi_\perp$ is identical to that recently predicted for the
typical localization length of MBL in a phenomenological renormalization group
flow. We demonstrate these important properties for a smallworld complex
network model and show the universality of our results by considering different
network parameters and different key observables of Anderson localization.

Granular grippers are highly adaptable end-effectors that exploit the
reversible jamming transition of granular materials to hold and manipulate
objects. Their holding force comes from the combination of three mechanisms:
frictional forces, geometrical constraints, and suction effects. In this work,
we experimentally study the effect of particle size on the suction mechanism.
Through X-ray computed tomography, we show that small particles (average
diameter d = 120 micrometers) achieve higher conformation around the object
than larger particles (d = 4mm), thus allowing the formation of air-tight
seals. When the gripper is pulled off, mimicking lifting of an object, vacuum
pressure is generated in the sealed cavity at the interface gripper--object. If
the particles used as filling material are too large, the gripper does not
conform closely around the object, leaving gaps between the gripper's membrane
and the object. These gaps prevent the formation of sealed vacuum cavities
between the object and the gripper and in turn hinder the suction mechanism
from operating.

<h3>$GW$+EDMFT investigation of Pr$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ under pressure</h3>

Motivated by the recent experimental observation of a large pressure effect
on $T_c$ in Pr$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, we study the electronic properties of this
compound as a function of pressure for $x=0$ and $0.2$ doping using
self-consistent $GW$+EDMFT. Our numerical results demonstrate a non-trivial
interplay between chemical doping and physical pressure, and small but
systematic changes in the orbital occupations, local level energies, and
interaction parameters with increasing pressure. The proper treatment of
correlation effects, beyond density function theory, is shown to play an
important role in revealing these trends. While the pressure dependent changes
in the electronic structure of the undoped compound suggest a more
single-band-like behavior in the high-pressure regime, a qualitatively
different behavior is found in the doped system. We also point out that the
fluctuations in the orbital occupations and spin states are not consistent with
a single-band picture, and that at least a two-band model is necessary to
reproduce the full result. This multi-orbital nature manifests itself most
clearly in the doped compound.

Bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are quantum materials that
can be structured with atomic precision, providing unprecedented control over
their physical properties. Accessing the intrinsic functionality of GNRs for
quantum technology applications requires the manipulation of single charges,
spins, or photons at the level of an individual GNR. However, experimentally,
contacting individual GNRs remains challenging due to their nanometer-sized
width and length as well as their high density on the metallic growth
substrate. Here, we demonstrate the contacting and electrical characterization
of individual GNRs in a multi-gate device architecture using single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as ultimately-scaled electrodes. The GNR-SWNT devices
exhibit well-defined quantum transport phenomena, including Coulomb blockade,
excited states, and Franck-Condon blockade, all characteristics pointing
towards the contacting of an individual GNR. Combined with the multi-gate
architecture, this contacting method opens a road for the integration of GNRs
in quantum devices to exploit their topologically trivial and non-trivial
nature.

We discuss how to include our recently proposed thermopotentiostat technique
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 136803 (2021)] into any existing ab initio molecular
dynamics (AIMD) package. Using thermopotentiostat AIMD simulations in the
canonical NVT{\Phi} ensemble at constant electrode potential, we compute the

<h3>Semiclassical dynamics of electrons in space-time crystal: Local  magnetization, polarization, and current response</h3>

A space-time crystal is defined as a quantum mechanical system with both
spatial and temporal periodicity. Such a system can be described by the
Floquet-Bloch (FB) theory. We first formulate a semiclassical theory by
constructing a wave-packet through the superposition of the FB wave functions
and derive the equations of motion of FB electrons subjected to slowly varying
external fields, revealing behaviors similar to ordinary Bloch electrons but
with quantities modified in the Floquet context. Specifically, we study
intrinsic magnetization due to the self-rotation of the wave-packet and the
polarization of a fully occupied FB band. Based on the semiclassical theory, we
can also show the fingerprint of the energy flow in such an
energy-non-conserved system. We then discuss the density matrix of a FB system
attached to a thermal bath, which allows us to investigate quantities involving
many electrons in the non-interacting limit. As an application, we calculate
the intrinsic current response in an oblique spacetime metal showing the
non-equilibrium nature of the FB system. The current response can also be
related to the acoustoelectric effect. Overall, we develop a systematic
approach for studying space-time crystals and provide a powerful tool to
explore the electronic properties of this exotic system with coupled space and
time.

<h3>The Impact of Stochastic Wavefunction Evolution in Dispersively Measured  Bose-Einstein Condensates</h3>

A fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that measurements change a
system's wavefunction to that most consistent with the measurement outcome,
even if no observer is present. Weak measurements -- termed partial or
non-destructive in different settings -- produce only limited information about
the system, and as a result only minimally change the system's state. Here, we
theoretically and experimentally characterize quantum back-action in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), weakly measured by the light scattered from a
far-from resonant, i.e., dispersivly interacting, probe laser beam. We
theoretically describe this process using a quantum trajectories approach and
present a measurement model based on an ideal photodetection mechanism. We
experimentally quantify the resulting wavefunction change with three
observations: the change in total atom number, the contrast of a Ramsey
interferometer, and the deposited energy. Further, we demonstrate control over
parasitic effects associated with the measurement process: probe-induced
photoassociation (an intrinsic atomic process), as well as stray optical
lattices (a technical consequence of weak retro-reflections). The observed
back-action is in good agreement with our measurement model, enabling true
quantum back-action limited measurements of BECs.

<h3>Spin-selective insulators</h3>

Spin-selective insulators emerge in systems composed of fermions with two
internal degrees of freedom and another carrier, which could be fermionic or
bosonic. These insulators are characterized by a gapless state for one kind of
fermion and an insulator state for the other, with the latter satisfying a
commensurability relation that involves the other carrier. We review the
different scenarios where these unique insulators arise, focusing on Bose-Fermi
mixtures, the most recent and promising scenario for observing these insulators
in cold atom setups.

Using mapping between topological defects in an easy-plane magnet and
electrical charges, we study interplay between vorticity and spin currents. We
demonstrate that the flow of vorticity is accompanied by the transverse spin
current generation -- an effect which can be termed as the spin Hall effect of
vorticity. We study this effect across the BKT transition and establish the
role of dissipation and spin non-conservation in the crossover from spin
superfluidity to diffusive spin transport. Our results pave the way for low
power computing devices relying on vorticity and spin flows.
