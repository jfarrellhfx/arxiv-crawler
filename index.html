<h3>Steady state correlations and induced trapping of an inertial AOUP particle</h3>

We study the dynamics of an inertial active Ornstein-Uhnlenbeck particle
self-propelling in a confined harmonic well. The transport behaviour of the
particle is investigated by analyzing the particle trajectories, steady state
correlations, and mean square displacement (MSD). The steady state correlation
functions for the position as well as velocity are exactly calculated using
different methods. We explore how the inertia affects the dynamical behaviour,
when the particle is confined in a harmonic trap as well as when it is set
free. From the exact calculation of MSD, it is observed that the initial time
regimes are ballistic for both harmonically confined particle and free
particle, whereas the long time regimes are diffusive for a free particle and
non diffusive for a harmonically confined particle. One of our interesting
observation is that the harmonically confined particle gets more and more
confined with increase in the self propulsion time or activity time of the
dynamics and finally it gets trapped for very large self propulsion time. For a
free particle, the velocity correlation decays by the complex interplay between
the inertial time scale and the self propulsion time scale of the dynamics.
Moreover, decorrelation in velocity happens only when these two time scales are
of equal order.

Most superconductors have an isotropic, single component order parameter, and
are well described by the BCS theory for superconductivity. Unconventional,
multiple components superconductors are exceptionally rare and are much less
understood. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved
macroscopic transport to study the candidate chiral superconductor,
4Hb-TaS$_2$. We reveal quasi-periodic one-dimensional modulations in the
tunneling conductance accompanied by two-fold symmetric superconducting
critical field. The strong modulation of the in-plane critical field, points to
a nematic, unconventional order parameter. However, the imaged vortex core is
nearly circular symmetric, suggesting an isotropic order parameter. We
reconcile this apparent discrepancy by modeling a competition between a
dominating chiral superconducting order parameter and a nematic one, the latter
emerges close to the normal phase. Our results strongly support the existence
of two-component superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and can provide useful
insights to other systems with coexistent charge order and superconductivity.

<h3>Local integrals of motion and the stability of many-body localisation in disorder-free systems</h3>

Many-body localisation in disordered systems in one spatial dimension is
typically understood in terms of the existence of an extensive number of
(quasi)-local integrals of motion (LIOMs) which are thought to decay
exponentially with distance and interact only weakly with one another. By
contrast, little is known about the form of the integrals of motion in
disorder-free systems which exhibit localisation. Here, we explicitly compute
the LIOMs for disorder-free localised systems, focusing on the case of a
linearly increasing potential. We show that while in the absence of
interactions, the LIOMs decay faster than exponentially, the addition of
interactions leads to the formation of a spatially extended plateau. We study
how varying the linear slope affects the localisation properties of the LIOMs,
finding that there is a significant finite-size dependence, and present
evidence that adding a weak harmonic potential does not result in typical
many-body localisation phenomenology. By contrast, the addition of disorder has
a qualitatively different effect, dramatically modifying the properties of the
LIOMs. Based on this, we speculate that disorder-free localisation is unlikely
to be stable at long times and for large systems.

<h3>Critical and non critical non-Hermitian topological phase transitions in one dimensional chains</h3>

In this work we investigate non-Hermitian topological phase transitions using
real-space edge states as a paradigmatic tool. We focus on the simplest
non-Hermitian variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model, including a parameter
that denotes the degree of non-hermiticity of the system. We study the behavior
of the zero energy edge states at the non-trivial topological phases with
integer and semi-integer topological winding number, according to the distance
to the critical point. We obtain that depending on the parameters of the model
the edge states may penetrate into the bulk, as expected in Hermitian
topological phase transitions. We also show that using the topological
characterization of the exceptional points, we can describe the intricate
chiral behavior of the edge states across the whole phase diagram. Moreover, we
characterize the criticality of the model by determining the correlation length
critical exponent, directly from numerical calculations of the penetration
length of the zero modes edge states.

<h3>Effect of strain on tunneling time in graphene magnetic barrier</h3>

We solve the Dirac equation in three regions of graphene to get the solutions
of the energy spectrum in connection to the strain, energy gap, and magnetic
field. The Goos-H\"anchen shifts and group delay time will be obtained by
applying the stationary phase approximation after the wave functions at the
interfaces have been matched. Our results suggest that the group delay time is
influenced by the presence of strain along the armchair and zigzag directions.
We show that the gate voltage and strain have the ability to change the group
delay from subluminality to superluminality. This may have significant uses in
high-speed graphene-based nanoelectronics.
