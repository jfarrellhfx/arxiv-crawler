<h3>Hydrodynamics of thermally-driven chiral propulsion and separation</h3>

Considerable effort has been directed towards the characterization of chiral
mesoscale structures, as shown in chiral protein assemblies and carbon
nanotubes. Here, we establish a thermally-driven hydrodynamic description for
the actuation and separation of mesoscale chiral structures in a fluid medium.
Cross flow of a Newtonian liquid with a thermal gradient gives rise to chiral
structure propulsion and separation according to their handedness. In turn, the
chiral suspension alters the liquid flow which thus acquires a transverse
(chiral) velocity component. Since observation of the predicted effects
requires a low degree of sophistication, our work provides an efficient and
inexpensive approach to test and calibrate chiral particle propulsion and
separation strategies.

<h3>On analytical theories for conductivity and self-diffusion in  concentrated electrolytes</h3>

Describing analytically the transport properties of electrolytes, such as
their conductivity or the self-diffusion of the ions, has been a central
challenge of chemical physics for almost a century. In recent years, this
question has regained some interest in light of Stochastic Density Field Theory
(SDFT) -- an analytical framework that allows the approximate determination of
density correlations in fluctuating systems. In spite of the success of this
theory to describe dilute electrolytes, its extension to concentrated solutions
raises a number of technical difficulties, and requires simplified descriptions
of the short-range repulsion between the ions. In this article, we discuss
recent approximations that were proposed to compute the conductivity of
electrolytes, in particular truncations of Coulomb interactions at short
distances. We extend them to another observable (the self-diffusion coefficient
of the ions) and compare them to earlier analytical approaches, such as the
mean spherical approximation and mode-coupling theory. We show how the
treatment of hydrodynamic effects in SDFT can be improved, that the choice of
the modified Coulomb interactions significantly affects the determination of
the properties of the electrolytes, and that comparison with other theories
provides a guide to extend SDFT approaches in this context.

<h3>The $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ Deconfined Phase Transition under the Fuzzy Sphere  Microscope: Approximate Conformal Symmetry, Pseudo-Criticality, and Operator  Spectrum</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16435" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16435</a>

The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) is an example of phase
transitions beyond the Landau symmetry breaking paradigm that attracts wide
interest. However, its nature has not been settled after decades of study. In
this paper, we apply the recently proposed fuzzy sphere regularization to study
the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) with a topological
Wess-Zumino-Witten term, which serves as a dual description of the DQCP with an
exact $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry. We demonstrate that the fuzzy sphere functions
as a powerful microscope, magnifying and revealing a wealth of crucial
information about the DQCP, ultimately paving the way towards its final answer.
In particular, through exact diagonalization, we provide clear evidence that
the DQCP exhibits approximate conformal symmetry. The evidence includes the
existence of a conserved $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry current, a stress tensor,
and integer-spaced levels between conformal primaries and their descendants.
Most remarkably, we have identified 19 conformal primaries and their 82
descendants. Furthermore, by examining the renormalization group flow of the
lowest symmetry singlet, we demonstrate that the DQCP is more likely
pseudo-critical, with the approximate conformal symmetry plausibly emerging
from nearby complex fixed points. Our computed primary spectrum also has
important implications, including the conclusion that the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP
cannot describe a direct transition from the N\'eel to valence bond solid phase
on the honeycomb lattice.

<h3>Metal-insulator transition and quantum magnetism in the SU(3)  Fermi-Hubbard Model: Disentangling Nesting and the Mott Transition</h3>

<br>
<br>
We use state-of-the-art numerical techniques to compute ground state
correlations in the two-dimensional SU(3) Fermi Hubbard model at $1/3$-filling,
modeling fermions with three possible spin flavors moving on a square lattice
with an average of one particle per site. We find clear evidence of a quantum
critical point separating a non-magnetic uniform metallic phase from a regime
where long-range `spin' order is present. In particular, there are multiple
successive transitions to states with regular, long-range alternation of the
different flavors, whose symmetry changes as the interaction strength
increases. In addition to the rich quantum magnetism, this important physical
system allows one to study integer filling and the associated Mott transition
disentangled from nesting, in contrast to the usual SU(2) model. Our results
also provide a significant step towards the interpretation of present and
future experiments on fermionic alkaline-earth atoms, and other realizations of
SU($N$) physics.

<h3>Chiral spin liquid phase in an optical lattice at mean-field level</h3>

We study an optical Raman square lattice with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ synthetic gauge
flux to show chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase for cold atoms based on slave-rotor
theory and spinon mean-field theory, respectively. An effective U($1$) gauge
flux generated by Raman potentials plays a major role in realizing the CSL
phase. By using slave-rotor techniques we find CSL phase at intermediate
on-site Fermi Hubbard interacting regime. For the strong interacting regime we
derive an effective spin model including up to the four spin interactions. By
spinon mean-field analysis it is shown that CSL phase is stabilized in the case
of strong magnetic frustration. The two mean-field approximation methods give
consistent phase diagrams and provide qualitative numerical evidence of the CSL
phase.

<h3>A high-performance GPU implementation of the electron-phonon Wannier  interpolation and the related transport properties</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16493" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16493</a>

<i>Zhe Liu, Bo Zhang, Zheyong Fan, Wu Li</i>
<br>
<br>
The electron-phonon Wannier interpolation (EPWI) method is an efficient way
to compute the properties of electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) accurately.
This study presents a GPU-accelerated implementation of the EPWI method for
computing transport properties, followed by a performance analysis. The
implementation is tested on common systems such as aluminum and silicon. The
results show complete consistency with those obtained through CPU computations.
The proposed algorithm has the capability of computing the conductivity of
aluminum in 20 minutes on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, adopting a $200^3$
electron and phonon sampling grid. This speed is 173 times higher than the
CPU-based algorithm, running on two nodes of the Intel Xeon Platinum 8260 CPU.
Such impressive acceleration is achieved by carefully designing the algorithm
to exploit the GPU's specific features. Furthermore, this methodology
establishes a generic foundation for EPWI algorithms, which can be applied to
other EPI-related properties.

<h3>Exploring chemical compound space with a graph-based recommender system</h3>

<br>
<br>
With the availability of extensive databases of inorganic materials,
data-driven approaches leveraging machine learning have gained prominence in
materials science research. In this study, we propose an innovative adaptation
of data-driven concepts to the mapping and exploration of chemical compound
space. Recommender systems, widely utilized for suggesting items to users,
employ techniques such as collaborative filtering, which rely on bipartite
graphs composed of users, items, and their interactions. Building upon the Open
Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), we constructed a bipartite graph where
elements from the periodic table and sites within crystal structures are
treated as separate entities. The relationships between them, defined by the
presence of ions at specific sites and weighted according to the thermodynamic
stability of the respective compounds, allowed us to generate an embedding
space that contains vector representations for each ion and each site. Through
the correlation of ion-site occupancy with their respective distances within
the embedding space, we explored new ion-site occupancies, facilitating the
discovery of novel stable compounds. Moreover, the graph's embedding space
enabled a comprehensive examination of chemical similarities among elements,
and a detailed analysis of local geometries of sites. To demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our method, we conducted a historical
evaluation using different versions of the OQMD and recommended new compounds
with Kagome lattices, showcasing the applicability of our approach to practical
materials design.

Close to equilibrium, the underlying symmetries of a system determine its
possible universal behavior. Far from equilibrium, however, different universal
phenomena associated with the existence of multiple non-thermal fixed points
can be realized for given microscopic symmetries. Here, we study this
phenomenon using a quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. We
prepare two different initial conditions and observe two distinct universal
scaling dynamics with different exponents. Measurements of the complex-valued
order parameter with spatial resolution allow us to characterize the
phase-amplitude excitations for the two scenarios. Our study provides new
insights into the phenomenon of universal dynamics far from equilibrium and
opens a path towards mapping out the associated basins of non-thermal fixed
points.

Spin-photon coupling presents an enticing opportunity for the long-range
coupling of spin qubits. The spin-photon coupling rate $g_{s}$ is proportional
to the charge-photon coupling rate $g_{c}$. To move deeper into the strong
coupling regime, $g_{c}$ can be enhanced by fabricating high-impedance cavities
using high kinetic inductance films. Here we report dc transport and microwave
response investigations of niobium nitride (NbN) films of different
thicknesses. The kinetic inductance increases rapidly as the film thickness is
reduced below 50 nm and for 15 nm NbN films we measure a sheet kinetic
inductance $L_{k,S}$ = 41.2 pH/$\Box$. As an application of the high kinetic
inductance films, we fabricate compact LC filters that are commonly used to
reduce microwave leakage in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices.
These filters feature up to 60 dB of attenuation near typical cavity resonance
frequencies $f_c$ = 8 GHz.

<h3>Effects of surface chemical modifications on the adhesion of metallic  interfaces. An high-throughput analysis</h3>

Chemical interactions between two surfaces in contact play a crucial role in
determining the mechanical and tribological behavior of solid interfaces. These
interactions can be quantified via adhesion energy, that is a measure of the
strength by which two surfaces bind together. Several works in literature
report how the presence of chemisorbed atoms at homo- and heterogeneous
solid-solid interfaces drastically change their proprieties. A precise
evaluation of how different species at solid contacts modulates their adhesion
would be extremely beneficial for a range of different technological fields:
from metallurgy to nuclear fusion. In this work we have used and
high-throughput approach to systematically explore the effects of the presence
of non-metallic elements, at different concentrations, on the adsorption and
adhesion energies of different homogeneous metallic interfaces. Together with
the databases for the adsorption and the adhesion energies, we calculated
several other properties such as the charge transferred at the interface, the
d-band edge shift for the substrate the Bond order and the interfacial density
redistribution for the hundreds of systems analyzed. These values were used to
define different trends with respect to chemical and concentration parameters
that could be useful for the development of engineered interfaces with selected
properties. In particular we noticed how the substrate with low filling of
d-band are the most prone to adsorb ad-atoms and how the adsorption of almost
all non-metallic elements decreases the adhesion energy of solid interfaces,
particularly in the case of Fluorine. Carbon and Boron were the only two
ad-atoms species that showed an opposite trend increasing the adhesion energy
instead.

<h3>What is a tunnel? A comment on frequent imprecision when speaking about  tunnels, at the example of two representative structures in the octahedral  molecular sieve group</h3>

A paper by Su et al (2013)[1] is focused on the presentation of \b{eta}-MnO2
(pyrolusite) as a new high-capacity electrode for Na batteries, arguing that
there is plenty of place in the tunnels to host sodium, which is clearly
contrary to general knowledge. Similar imprecisions are found in other work so
that it might be useful to shortly address the issue of cavities and tunnels in
a general way. Here, two structures of the octahedral molecular sieve group
(\b{eta}-MnO2 pyrolusite and {\alpha}-MnO2 hollandite) are taken as an example
and analysed at some depth regarding their tunnel structure using advanced
software. Tunnels and their occupation are of fundamental importance for the
application of such materials as electrodes or in strongly correlated electron
systems.

<h3>Strong enhancement of magnetic ordering temperature and  structural/valence transitions in EuPd3S4 under high pressure</h3>

<br>
<br>
We present a comprehensive study of the mixed valent compound, EuPd3S4, by
electrical transport, X-ray diffraction, time-domain 151Eu synchrotron
M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements under
high pressure. The electrical transport measurements show that the
antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, TN, increases rapidly from 2.8 K at
ambient pressure to 23.5 K at ~19 GPa and plateaus between ~19 and ~29 GPa
after which no anomaly associated with TN is detected. A pressure-induced first
order structural transition from cubic to tetragonal is observed, with a rather
broad coexistence region (~20 GPa to ~32 GPa) that corresponds to the TN
plateau. M\"ossbauer spectroscopy measurements show a clear valence transition
from approximately 50:50 Eu2+:Eu3+ to fully Eu3+ at ~28 GPa, consistent with
the vanishing of the magnetic order at the same pressure. X-ray absorption data
show a transition to a fully trivalent state at a similar pressure. Our results
show that pressure first greatly enhances TN, most likely via enhanced
hybridization between the Eu 4f states and the conduction band, and then,
second, causes a structural phase transition that coincides with the conversion
of the europium to a fully trivalent state.

<h3>Ab initio quantum many-body description of superconducting trends in the  cuprates</h3>

<br>
<br>
Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond
low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order of
several doped cuprate materials and structures. We find that we can correctly
capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where pairing order
increases with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing
order varies with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations,
we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal
doping are the best descriptors of the maximal pairing order. Our microscopic
analysis further identifies short-range copper spin fluctuations, together with
multi-orbital charge fluctuations, as central to the pairing trends. Our work
illustrates the possibility of a quantitative computational understanding of
high-temperature superconducting materials.

<h3>Smectic Pair Density Wave Order in EuRbFe4As4</h3>

<br>
<br>
The pair density wave (PDW) is a novel superconducting state in which Cooper
pairs carry center-of-mass momentum in equilibrium, leading to the breaking of
translational symmetry. Experimental evidence for such a state exists in high
magnetic field and in some materials that feature density wave orders that
explicitly break translational symmetry. However, evidence for a zero-field PDW
state that exists independent of other spatially ordered states has so far been
elusive. Here, we show that such a state exists in the iron pnictide
superconductor EuRbFe4As4 (Eu-1144), a material that features coexisting
superconductivity (Tc ~ 37K) and magnetism (Tm ~ 15 K). We show from the
Spectroscopic Imaging Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (SI-STM) measurements that
the superconducting gap at low temperature has long-range, unidirectional
spatial modulations with an incommensurate period of ~8 unit cells. Upon
raising the temperature above Tm, the modulated superconductor disappears, but
a uniform superconducting gap survives to Tc. When an external magnetic field
is applied, gap modulations disappear inside the vortex halo. The SI-STM and
bulk measurements show the absence of other density wave orders, showing that
the PDW state is a primary, zero-field superconducting state in this compound.
Both four-fold rotational symmetry and translation symmetry are recovered above
Tm, indicating that the PDW is a smectic order.

<h3>Impact of the phonon environment on the nonlinear quantum-dot cavity  QED. II. Analytical approach</h3>

<br>
<i>L. S. Sirkina, E. A. Muljarov</i>
<br>
<br>
The effect of phonons on a nonlinear optical response of a quantum dot-cavity
system in quantum strong coupling regime can be accounted for by a fully
analytical treatment, provided that the exciton-phonon dynamics is much faster
than the exciton-cavity dynamics. Modern experiments involving semiconductor
quantum dots embedded in optical microcavities typically meet this criterion.
We find that, for a relatively small exciton-cavity coupling, the effect of
phonons is concentrated mainly in the polaron shift of the exciton frequency
and reduction of exciton-cavity coupling by the Huang-Rhys factor. We have
generalized this result to an arbitrary optical nonlinearity and demonstrated a
good agreement with the exact solution in a wide range of temperatures. This
generalization provides access to higher rungs of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder,
where exact numerical approaches are impractical or even impossible. At larger
coupling strengths and low temperatures, our approximation is also in good
agreement with the exact solution, which makes it a very useful tool for
addressing the phonon contribution to the coherent dynamics of a nonlinear
optical system. We demonstrate our results for third-order optical polarization
with varying observation time and delay time between excitation pulses in the
form of two-dimensional spectra. These spectra provide useful information about
the coherent coupling between the exciton and the cavity modes. The presented
analytical approach is also compared with another useful approximation, having
the form of a matrix product, which is a special case of the asymptotically
exact solution in the limit of a short phonon memory time.

In a generic random system, the coexistence of extended and localized states

initial state in, for example, the quantum quenches which involving the local
Hamiltonian. The robust thermalization is also evidenced in terms of the
microscopic canonical ensemble average in the thermalization limit[10], which
satisfies the weak ETH. Here we provide another pespective that considering the
local conservation of an nonintegrable system the stubborn correlations between

Recently, high-order sideband polarimetry has been established as an
experimental method that links the polarization of sidebands to an interference
of Bloch wavefunctions. However, the robustness of sideband polarizations to
increasing dephasing remains to be explored. Here, we investigate the
dependence of high-order sideband generation in bulk gallium arsenide on
dephasing by tuning temperature. We find that the intensities of the sidebands,
but not their polarizations, depend strongly on temperature. Using our
polarimetry method, we are able to isolate the contributions of electron-heavy
hole (HH) and electron-light hole (LH) pairs to sideband intensities, and
separately extract the nonequilibrium dephasing coefficients associated with
the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons and acoustic (A) phonons for each species
of electron-hole pair. We find that $\Gamma_{\text{HH},\text{A}} = 6.1 \pm 1.6$
$\mu$eV/K, $\Gamma_{\text{LH},\text{A}} < 1.5$ $\mu$eV/K,
$\Gamma_{\text{HH},\text{LO}} = 14 \pm 3$ meV, and

The effect of two- and three-body interactions on the modulation instability

condensate is studied within a quasi-one-dimensional model. To this aim, we
perform numerical and analytical investigations of the associated dispersion
relations derived from the corresponding coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The
interplay between the linear (SO and Rabi) couplings with the nonlinear
cubic-quintic interactions are explored in the mixture, considering miscible
and immiscible configurations, with a focus on the impact in the analysis of
experimental realizations with general binary coupled systems, in which
nonlinear interactions can be widely varied together with linear couplings.

Optically addressable spin defects hosted in two-dimensional van der Waals
materials represent a new frontier for quantum technologies, promising to lead
to a new class of ultrathin quantum sensors and simulators. Recently, hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host several types of optically
addressable spin defects, thus offering a unique opportunity to simultaneously
address and utilise various spin species in a single material. Here we
demonstrate an interplay between two separate spin species within a single hBN
crystal, namely $S=1$ boron vacancy defects and visible emitter spins. We
unambiguously prove that the visible emitters are $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spins and
further demonstrate room temperature coherent control and optical readout of
both spin species. Importantly, by tuning the two spin species into resonance
with each other, we observe cross-relaxation indicating strong inter-species
dipolar coupling. We then demonstrate magnetic imaging using the
$S=\frac{1}{2}$ defects, both under ambient and cryogenic conditions, and
leverage their lack of intrinsic quantization axis to determine the anisotropic
magnetic susceptibility of a test sample. Our results establish hBN as a
versatile platform for quantum technologies in a van der Waals host at room
temperature.

<h3>Bardasis-Schrieffer-like phase mode in a superconducting bilayer</h3>

We theoretically study the low-lying collective modes of an even-parity
spin-singlet superconducting bilayer, where strong spin-orbit coupling leads to
a closely competing odd-parity parity pairing state. We develop a
gauge-invariant theory for the coupling of phase fluctuations to an external
electromagnetic field and show that the competing odd-parity pairing state
gives rise to a Bardasis-Schrieffer-like phase mode within the excitation gap.
Accounting for the long-range Coulomb interaction, however, we find that this
mode hybridizes with an antisymmetric plasmon and is likely pushed into the
quasiparticle continuum.

<br>
<br>
The study of the iron-based superconductor, FeSe, has resulted in various
topics, such as the interplay among superconductivity, nematicity, and
magnetism, Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Bose-Einstein-condensation (BCS-BEC)
crossover, and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity.
Recently, topologically protected nodal Fermi surfaces, referred to as
Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs), have garnered much attention. A theoretical
model for the S-substituted FeSe system demonstrated that BFSs can manifest
under the conditions of spin-orbit coupling, multi-band systems, and
superconductivity with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Here we report the
observation of spin fluctuations originating from BFSs in the superconducting
(SC) state via $^{77}$Se-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements to 100 mK. In
a heavily S-substituted FeSe, we found an anomalous enhancement of low-energy
spin fluctuations deep in the SC state, which cannot be explained by an
impurity effect. Such unusual behavior implies the presence of significant spin
fluctuations of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, which are associated with possible

Systems subject to high-frequency driving exhibit Floquet prethermalization,
that is, they heat exponentially slowly on a time scale that is large in the
drive frequency, $\tau_{\rm h} \sim \exp(\omega)$. Nonetheless, local
observables can decay much faster via energy conserving processes, which are
expected to cause a rapid decay in the fidelity of an initial state. Here we
show instead that the fidelities of eigenstates of the time-averaged
Hamiltonian, $H_0$, display an exponentially long lifetime over a wide range of
frequencies -- even as generic initial states decay rapidly. When $H_0$ has
quantum scars, or highly excited-eigenstates of low entanglement, this leads to
long-lived non-thermal behavior of local observables in certain initial states.
We present a two-channel theory describing the fidelity decay time $\tau_{\rm
f}$: the interzone channel causes fidelity decay through energy absorption i.e.
coupling across Floquet zones, and ties $\tau_{\rm f}$ to the slow heating time
scale, while the intrazone channel causes hybridization between states in the
same Floquet zone. Our work informs the robustness of experimental approaches
for using Floquet engineering to generate interesting many-body Hamiltonians,
with and without scars.

RV6Sn6 (R = Y and lanthanides) with two-dimensional vanadium-kagome surface
states is an ideal platform to investigate kagome physics and manipulate the
kagome features to realize novel phenomena. Utilizing the micron-scale
spatially resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and
first-principles calculations, we report a systematical study of the electronic
structures of RV6Sn6 (R = Gd, Tb, and Lu) on the two cleaved surfaces, i.e.,
the V- and RSn1-terminated (001) surfaces. The calculated bands without any
renormalization match well with the main ARPES dispersive features, indicating
the weak electronic correlation in this system. We observe 'W'-like kagome
surface states around the Brillouin zone corners showing R-element-dependent
intensities, which is probably due to various coupling strengths between V and
RSn1 layers. Our finding suggests an avenue for tuning electronic states by
interlayer coupling based on two-dimensional kagome lattices.

Cold atom traps are at the heart of many quantum applications in science and
technology. The preparation and control of atomic clouds involves complex
optimization processes, that could be supported and accelerated by machine
learning. In this work, we introduce reinforcement learning to cold atom
experiments and demonstrate a flexible and adaptive approach to control a
magneto-optical trap. Instead of following a set of predetermined rules to
accomplish a specific task, the objectives are defined by a reward function.
This approach not only optimizes the cooling of atoms just as an
experimentalist would do, but also enables new operational modes such as the
preparation of pre-defined numbers of atoms in a cloud. The machine control is
trained to be robust against external perturbations and able to react to
situations not seen during the training. Finally, we show that the time
consuming training can be performed in-silico using a generic simulation and
demonstrate successful transfer to the real world experiment.

Stationary coherence in small conducting arrays has been shown to influence
the transport efficiency of electronic nanodevices. Model schemes that capture
the interplay between electron delocalization and system-reservoir interactions
on the device performance are therefore important for designing next-generation
nanojunctions powered by quantum coherence. We use a Lindblad open quantum
system approach to obtain the current-voltage characteristics of small-size
networks of interacting conducting sites subject to radiative and non-radiative
interactions with the environment, for experimentally-relevant case studies.
Lindblad theory is shown to reproduce recent measurements of negative
conductance in single-molecule junctions using a biased two-site model driven
by thermal fluctuations. For array sites with conducting ground and excited
orbitals in the presence of radiative incoherent pumping, we show that Coulomb
interactions that otherwise suppress charge transport can be overcome to
produce light-induced currents. We also show that in nanojunctions having
asymmetric transfer rates between the array and electrical contacts, an
incoherent driving field can induce photocurrents at zero bias voltage whose
direction depend on the type or orbital delocalization established between
sites. Possible extensions of the theory are discussed.

Two new ultimately thin vanadium rich 2D materials based on VS2 are created
via molecular beam epitaxy and investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy
and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The controlled synthesis of
stoichiometric singlelayer VS2 or either of the two vanadium-rich materials is
achieved by varying the sample coverage and the sulphur pressure during
annealing. Through annealing of small stoichiometric single-layer VS2 islands
without S pressure, S-vacancies spontaneously order in 1D arrays, giving rise
to patterned adsorption. We provide an atomic model of the 1D patterned phase,
with a stoichiometry of V4S7. By depositing larger amounts of vanadium and
sulphur, which are subsequently annealed in a S-rich atmosphere,
self-intercalated ultimately thin V5S8-derived layers are obtained, which host
2 x 2 V-layers between sheets of VS2. We provide atomic models for the thinnest
V5S8-derived structures. Finally, we use scanning tunneling spectroscopy to
investigate the charge density wave observed in the 2D V5S8-derived islands.

<br>
<br>
We report a topological phase transition in quantum-confined cadmium arsenide
(Cd3As2) thin films under an in-plane Zeeman field when the Fermi level is
tuned into the topological gap via an electric field. Symmetry considerations
in this case predict the appearance of a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal (2D
WSM), with a pair of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality at charge neutrality that
are protected by space-time inversion (C2T) symmetry. We show that the 2D WSM
phase displays unique transport signatures, including saturated resistivities
on the order of h/e^2 that persist over a range of in-plane magnetic fields.
Moreover, applying a small out-of-plane magnetic field, while keeping the
in-plane field within the stability range of the 2D WSM phase, gives rise to a
well-developed odd integer quantum Hall effect, characteristic of degenerate,
massive Weyl fermions. A minimal four-band k.p model of Cd3As2, which
incorporates first-principles effective g factors, qualitatively explains our
findings.

<br>
<br>
We investigate families of soliton solutions in a spin-orbit coupled
Bose-Einstein condensate embedded in an optical lattice, which bifurcate from
the nearly flat lowest band. Unlike the conventional gap solitons the obtained
solutions have the shape well approximated by a Wannier function (or a few
Wannier functions) of the underlying linear Hamiltonian with amplitudes varying
along the family and with nearly constant widths. The Wannier solitons (WSs)
sharing all symmetries of the system Hamiltonian are found to be stable. Such
solutions allow for the construction of Wannier breathers, that can be viewed
as nonlinearly coupled one-hump solitons. The breathers are well described by a
few-mode model and manifest stable behavior either in an oscillatory regime
with balanced average populations or in a self-trapping regime characterized by
unbalanced atomic populations of the local potential minima (similarly to the
conventional boson Josephson junction), with the frequencies controlled by the
inter-atomic interactions.

<br>
<i>Adwait Naravane, Nilmani Mathur</i>
<br>
<br>
We investigate the application of deep learning techniques employing the
conditional variational autoencoders for semi-supervised learning of latent
parameters to describe phase transition in the two-dimensional (2D)
ferromagnetic Ising model and the two-dimensional XY model. For both models, we
utilize spin configurations generated using the Wolff algorithms below and
above the critical temperatures. For the 2D Ising model we find the latent
parameter of conditional variational autoencoders is correlated to the known
order parameter of magnetization more efficiently than their correspondence in
variational autoencoders used previously. It can also clearly identify the
restoration of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry beyond the critical point. The
critical temperature extracted from the latent parameter at larger lattices are
found to be approaching its correct value. Similarly, for the 2D XY model, we
find our chosen network with the latent representation of conditional
variational autoencoders is equally capable of separating the two phases
between the high and low temperatures, again at the correct critical
temperature with reasonable accuracy. Together these results show that the
latent representation of conditional variational autoencoders can be employed
efficiently to identify the phases of condensed matter systems, without their
prior knowledge.

<br>
<br>
By molecular dymanics simulations we study the spin Seebeck effect as a
function of magnetic field in the prototype classical easy-axis
antiferromagnetic chain, in the far-out of equilibrium as well as linear
response regime. We find distinct behavior in the low field antiferromagnetic,
middle field canted and high field ferromagnetic phase. In particular, in the
open boundary system at low temperatures, we observe a divergence of the spin
current in the spin-flop transition between the antiferromagnetic and canted
phase, accompanied by a change of sign in the generated spin current by the
temperture gradient. These results are corroborated by a simple spin-wave
phenomenological analysis and simulations in the linear response regime. They
shed light on the spin current sign change observed in experiments in bulk
antiferromagnetic materials.

In this Reply we respond to the comment by Das Sarma and Pan [1] on Hess et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 207001, "Trivial Andreev Band Mimicking Topological
Bulk Gap Reopening in the Nonlocal Conductance of Long Rashba Nanowires" [2].
First, we note that Das Sarma and Pan reproduce the key results of Hess et al.,
substantiating that our findings are entirely valid. Next, we clarify the
incorrect statement by Das Sarma and Pan that the main result of Hess et al.
requires a "contrived periodic pristine system", pointing out the extensive
discussion of positional disorder in the Hess et al. We also demonstrate that
nonlocal conductance features are generically reduced by disorder. This applies
to both an Andreev band and to a genuine topological bulk gap reopening
signature (BRS). In fact, the suppression of nonlocal conductance of a genuine
BRS by disorder was discussed in, e.g., Pan, Sau, Das Sarma, PRB 103, 014513
(2021) [3]. We conclude that, contrary to the claims of Das Sarma and Pan, the
minimal model of Hess et al. is relevant to current realistic nanowire devices
where only a few overlapping ABSs would be required to mimic a BRS.

Analyzing quantum many-body problems and elucidating the entangled structure
of quantum states is a grand challenge common to a wide range of fields.
Recently, for this challenge, a novel approach using machine learning has been
introduced. The idea is to "embed" nontrivial quantum correlations (quantum
entanglement) into artificial neural networks. Through intensive developments,
artificial neural network methods are becoming a new powerful tool for
analyzing quantum many-body problems. Among various artificial neural networks,
this topical review focuses on Boltzmann machines and provides an overview of

We consider a system of non-interacting Brownian particles on a line with a
step-like initial condition and investigate the behavior of the local time at
the origin at large times. We compute the mean and the variance of the local
time and show that the memory effects are governed by the Fano factor
associated to the initial condition. For the uniform initial condition, we show
that the probability distribution of the local time admits large deviation form
and compute the corresponding large deviation functions for the annealed and
quenched averaging schemes. The two resulting large deviation functions are
very different. Our analytical results are supported by extensive numerical
simulations.

<br>
<br>
Hydrogen-induced multi-spot corrosion on the surface of polycrystalline rare
metals is a complex process, which involves the interactions between phases
(metal, hydride and oxide), grain orientations, grain boundaries, and corrosion
spots. To accurately simulate this process and comprehend the underlying
physics, a theoretical method is required that includes the following
mechanisms: i) hydrogen diffusion, ii) phase transformation, iii) elastic
interactions between phases, especially, the interactions between the oxide
film and the hydride, iv) elastic interactions between grains, and v)
interactions between hydrogen solutes and grain boundaries. In this study, we
report a multiphase-field model that incorporates all these requirements, and
conduct a comprehensive study of hydrogen-induced spot corrosion on the uranium
metal surface, including the investigation of the oxide film, multi-spot
corrosion, grain orientation, and grain boundary in the monocrystal, bicrystal,
and polycrystal systems. The results indicate that the oxide film can inhibit
the growth of hydrides and plays a crucial role in determining the correct
morphology of the hydride at the triple junction of phases. The elastic
interaction between multiple corrosion spots causes the merging of corrosion
spots and promotes the growth of hydrides. The introduction of grain
orientations and grain boundaries results in a variety of intriguing
intracrystalline and intergranular hydride morphologies. The model presented
here is generally applicable to the hydrogen-induced multi-spot corrosion on
any rare metal surface.

Hypothesis: Surfactant-free microemulsion (SFME), an emerging phenomenology
that occurs in the monophasic zone of a broad category of ternary mixtures
'hydrophobe/hydrotrope/water', has attracted extensive interests due to their
unique physicochemical properties. The potential of this kind of ternary fluid
for solubilization and drug delivery make them promising candidates in many
industrial scenarios. Experiments: Here the thermodynamic behavior of these
multiscale nanodomains formed in the ternary trans-anethol/ethanol/water system
over a wide range of temperatures is explored. The macroscopic physical
properties of the ternary solutions are characterized, with revealing the
temperature dependence of refractive index and dynamic viscosity. Findings:
With increasing temperature, the ternary system shows extended areas in the
monophasic zone. We demonstrate that the phase behavior and the multiscale
nanodomains formed in the monophasic zone can be precisely and reversibly tuned
by altering the temperature. Increasing temperature can destroy the stability
of the multiscale nanodomains in equilibrium, with an exponential decay in the
scattering light intensity. Nevertheless, molecular-scale aggregates and
mesoscopic droplets exhibit significantly different response behaviors to
temperature stimuli. The temperature-sensitive nature of the ternary SFME
system provides a crucial step forward exploring and industrializing its
stability.

The recent report of a half-quantized thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev
material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has sparked a strong debate on whether it is
generated by Majorana fermion edge currents or whether other more conventional
mechanisms involving magnons or phonons are at its origin. A more direct
evidence for Majorana fermions which could be expected to arise from a
contribution to the longitudinal heat conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ at
$T\rightarrow0$ is elusive due to a very complex magnetic field dependence of
$\kappa_{xx}$. Here, we report very low temperature (below 1~K) thermal
conductivity ($\kappa$) of another candidate Kitaev material,
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. The application of a magnetic field along different
principal axes of the crystal reveals a strong directional-dependent
magnetic-field ($\bf B$) impact on $\kappa$. We show that no evidence for
mobile quasiparticles except phonons can be concluded at any field from 0~T to
the field polarized state. In particular, severely scattered phonon transport
is observed across the $B-T$ phase diagram, which is attributed to prominent
magnetic fluctuations. Cascades of phase transitions are uncovered for all $\bf
B$ directions by probing the strength of magnetic fluctuations via a precise
record of $\kappa$($B$). Our results thus rule out recent proposals for
itinerant magnetic excitations in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, and emphasise the
importance of discriminating true spin liquid transport properties from
scattered phonons in candidate materials.

Silicene, the silicon equivalent of graphene, is attracting increasing
scientific and technological attention in view of the exploitation of its
exotic electronic properties. This novel material has been theoretically
predicted to exist as a free-standing layer in a low-buckled, stable form, and
can be synthesized by the deposition of Si on appropriate crystalline
substrates. By employing low-energy electron diffraction and microscopy, we
have studied the growth of Si on Ag(111) and observed a rich variety of
rotationally non-equivalent silicene structures. Our results highlight a very
complex formation diagram, reflecting the coexistence of different and nearly
degenerate silicene phases, whose relative abundance can be controlled by
varying the Si coverage and growth temperature. At variance with other studies,
we find that the formation of single-phase silicene monolayers cannot be
achieved on Ag(111).

The low-temperature phase diagram of a Bosonic system is predicted to contain
an exotic quantum phase, called a supersolid, that is defined by broken
translational symmetry and off-diagonal long-range order. This unique
combination of properties enables a seemingly paradoxical scenario where a
bosonic solid exhibits dissipationless mass flow. However, despite decades of
extensive efforts, experimental realization of such a supersolid phase remains
elusive. In this work we report experimental observation of a
superfluid-to-insulating transition in the bosonic system of spatially indirect
excitons in double layer graphene. Utilizing a variety of transport methods to
characterize the superfluid-insulator phase boundary as a function of both
density and temperature suggests the insulator to be a solid phase driven by
repulsive dipole-dipole interactions in the dilute limit. The exciton solid
exhibits a unique melting transition, with the high-temperature phase
recovering a hallmark transport signature of off-diagonal long-range order,
perfect Coulomb drag. The reentrant superfluid-like behaviour could indicate
the low temperature solid also corresponds to a quantum coherent phase.

The ability to characterise the three-dimensional microstructure of
multiphase materials is essential for understanding the interaction between
phases and associated materials properties. Here, laboratory-based
diffraction-contrast tomography (DCT), a recently-established materials
characterization technique that can determine grain phases, morphologies,
positions and orientations in a voxel-based reconstruction method, was used to
map part of a dual-phase steel alloy sample. To assess the resulting
microstructures that were produced by the DCT technique, an EBSD map was
collected within the same sample volume. To identify the 2D slice of the 3D DCT
reconstruction that best corresponded to the EBSD map, a novel registration
technique based solely on grain-averaged orientations was developed -- this
registration technique requires very little a priori knowledge of dataset
alignment and can be extended to other techniques that only recover
grain-averaged orientation data such as far-field 3D X-ray diffraction
microscopy. Once the corresponding 2D slice was identified in the DCT dataset,
comparisons of phase balance, grain size, shape and texture were performed
between DCT and EBSD techniques. More complicated aspects of the
microstructural morphology such as grain boundary shape and grains less than a
critical size were poorly reproduced by the DCT reconstruction, primarily due
to the difference in resolutions of the technique compared with EBSD. However,
lab-based DCT is shown to accurately determine the centre-of-mass position,
orientation, and size of the large grains for each phase present, austenite and
martensitic ferrite. The results reveals a complex ferrite grain network of
similar crystal orientations that are absent from the EBSD dataset. Such detail
demonstrates that lab-based DCT, as a technique, shows great promise in the
field of multi-phase material characterization.

We employ the microcanonical inflection-point analysis method, developed for
the systematic identification and classification of phase transitions in
systems of any size, to study the two-dimensional Ising model at various
lattice sizes and in the thermodynamic limit. Exact results for the density of
states, which were obtained by exact algorithmic computation, provide evidence
for higher-order transitions in addition to the well-studied second-order
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition. An independent third-order phase
transition is identified in the ferromagnetic phase, whereas another
third-order transition resides in the paramagnetic phase. The latter is a
dependent transition, i.e., it is inevitably associated with the critical
transition, but it remains separate from the critical point in the
thermodynamic limit. For a deeper insight into the nature of these additional
transitions, a detailed analysis of spin clusters is performed.

THz generation from femtosecond photoexcited spintronic heterostructures has
recently become a versatile tool for investigating ultrafast spin-transport and
transient charge-current in a non-contact and non-invasive manner. The same
from the orbital effects is still in the primitive stage. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate orbital-to-charge current conversion in metallic
heterostructures, consisting of a ferromagnetic layer adjacent to either a
light or a heavy metal layer, through detection of the emitted THz pulses.
Temperature-dependent experiments help to disentangle the orbital and spin
components that are manifested in the respective Hall-conductivities,
contributing to THz emission. NiFe/Nb shows the strongest inverse orbital Hall
effect with an experimentally extracted value of effective Hall-conductivity,
\sigma_SOH^int^eff ~ 280 {\Omega}^(-1){cm}^(-1), while CoFeB/Pt shows maximum
contribution from the inverse spin Hall effect. In addition, we observe nearly
ten-fold enhancement in the THz emission due to pronounced orbital-transport in
W-insertion heavy metal layer in CoFeB/W/Ta heterostructure as compared to the
CoFeB/Ta bilayer counterpart.

A main source of capacity fading in lithium-ion batteries is the degradation
of the active cathode materials caused by the series of volume changes during
charge and discharge cycles. The quaternary colquiriite-type fluorides
Li$_x$CaFeF$\mathrm{_6}$ and Li$_x$CaCoF$\mathrm{_6}$ were reported to have
negligible volume changes in specific Li concentration ranges, making the
underlying colquiriite structure a promising candidate for so-called
zero-strain behavior. Using first-principles electronic structure calculations
based on density functional theory with a Hubbard-$U$ correlation correction on
the transition-metal ions, we systematically investigate the equilibrium
volumes of the colquiriite-type fluorides Li$_x$CaMF$\mathrm{_6}$ with M =Ti,
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni at the Li concentrations $x$=0, 1, and 2. We
elucidate the connection between the total volume of the structures and the
local volumes of fluorine coordinated octahedra around the cations, and we find
trends along the series of the 3d transition-metal elements. In the lithiation
step from $x$=1 to $x$=2 we find volume changes of about 10 %, and we discuss
the discrepancy to the experimentally reported smaller value for
Li$_x$CaFeF$\mathrm{_6}$. From $x$=0 to $x$=1 we describe the compensating
structural mechanisms that lead to an exceptionally small volume change of
Li$_x$CaMnF$\mathrm{_6}$. This compound is therefore a particularly promising
zero-strain cathode material.

Kagome spin ice is one of the canonical examples of highly frustrated
magnets. The effective magnetic degrees of freedom in kagome spin ice are Ising
spins residing on a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles. Due to
strong geometrical frustration, nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions
on the kagome lattice give rise to a macroscopic number of degenerate classical
ground states characterized by ice rules. Elementary excitations at low
temperatures are defect-triangles that violate the ice rules and carry an
additional net magnetic charge relative to the background. We perform
large-scale Glauber dynamics simulations to study the nonequilibrium dynamics
of kagome ice under slow cooling. We show that the density of residual charge
defects exhibits a power law dependence on the quench rate for the class of
algebraic cooling protocols. The numerical results are well captured by the
rate equation for the charge defects based on the reaction kinetics theory. As
the relaxation time of the kagome ice phase remains finite, there is no
dynamical freezing as in the Kibble-Zurek scenario. Instead, we show that the
power-law behavior originates from the a thermal excitation that decay
algebraically with time at the late stage of the cooling schedule. Similarities
and differences in quench dynamics of other spin ice systems are also
discussed.

The directed bond percolation is a paradigmatic model in nonequilibrium
statistical physics. It captures essential physical information on the nature
of continuous phase transition between active and absorbing states. In this
paper, we study this model by means of the field-theoretic formulation with a
subsequent renormalization group analysis. We calculate all critical exponents
needed for the quantitative description of the corresponding universality class
to the third order in perturbation theory.
Using dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction scheme, we carry
out perturbative calculations in a formally small parameter $\varepsilon$,
where $\varepsilon=4-d$
is a deviation from the upper critical dimension $d_c=4$. We use a nontrivial
combination of analytical and numerical tools in order to determine ultraviolet
divergent parts of Feynman diagrams.

brief introduction to Generalized Hydrodynamics, which provides a description
of the large scale structure of the dynamics in quantum integrable models. The

Due to their versatile composition and customizable properties, A$_2$BC
Heusler alloys have found applications in magnetic refrigeration, magnetic
shape memory effects, permanent magnets, and spintronic devices. The discovery
of all-$d$-metal Heusler alloys with improved mechanical properties compared to
those containing main group elements, presents an opportunity to engineer
Heuslers alloys for energy-related applications. Using high-throughput density
functional theory calculations, we screened magnetic all-$d$-metal Heusler
compounds and identified 686 (meta)stable compounds. Our detailed analysis
revealed that the inverse Heusler structure is preferred when the
electronegativity difference between the A and B/C atoms is small, contrary to
conventional Heusler alloys. Additionally, our calculations of Pugh ratios and
Cauchy pressures demonstrated that ductile and metallic bonding are widespread
in all-$d$-metal Heuslers, supporting their enhanced mechanical behaviour. We
identified 49 compounds with a double-well energy surface based on Bain path
calculations and magnetic ground states, indicating their potential as
candidates for magnetocaloric and shape memory applications. Furthermore, by
calculating the free energies, we propose that 11 compounds exhibit structural
phase transitions, and propose isostructural substitution to enhance the
magnetocaloric effect.

<h3>Thermodynamic phase diagram of the competition between superconductivity  and charge order in cuprates</h3>

We argue that there is a special doping point in the phase diagram of
cuprates, such that the condensation of holes into a charge-ordered and into a
superconducting phase are degenerate in energy but with an energy barrier in
between. We present a Monte Carlo simulation of this problem without and with
quenched disorder. While in the clean case charge order and superconductivity
are separated by a first-order line which is nearly independent of temperature,
in the presence of quenched disorder, charge order is fragmented into domains
separated by superconducting filaments reminiscent of the supersolid behavior
in $^4$He. The resulting phase diagram is in good agreement with the
experiments.

<h3>Topological diffusive metal in amorphous transition metal mono-silicides</h3>

In chiral crystals crystalline symmetries can protect multifold fermions,
pseudo-relativistic masless quasiparticles that have no high-energy
counterparts. Their realization in transition metal mono-silicides has
exemplified their intriguing physical properties, such as long Fermi arc
surface states and unusual optical responses. Recent experimental studies on
amorphous transition metal mono-silicides suggest that topological properties
may survive beyond crystals, even though theoretical evidence is lacking.
Motivated by these findings, we theoretically study a tight-binding model of
amorphous transition metal mono-silicides. We find that topological properties
of multifold fermions survive in the presence of structural disorder that
converts the semimetal into a diffusive metal. We characterize this topological
diffusive metal phase with the spectral localizer, a real-space topological
indicator that we show can signal multifold fermions. Our findings showcase how
topological properties can survive in disordered metals, and how they can be
uncovered using the spectral localizer.

<h3>2D Fractons from Gauging Exponential Symmetries</h3>

<br>
<br>
The scope of quantum field theory is extended by introducing a broader class
of discrete gauge theories with fracton behavior in 2+1D. We consider
translation invariant systems that carry special charge conservation laws,
which we refer to as \text{exponential polynomial symmetries}. Upon gauging
these symmetries, the resulting $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theories exhibit fractonic
physics, including constrained mobility of quasiparticles and UV dependence of
the ground state degeneracy. For appropriate values of theory parameters, we
find a family of models whose excitations, albeit being deconfined, can only
move in the form of bound states rather than isolated monopoles. For
concreteness, we study in detail the low-energy physics and topological sectors
of a particular model through a universal protocol, developed for determining
the holonomies of a given theory. We find that a single excitation, isolated in
a region of characteristic size $R$, can only move from its original position
through the action of operators with support on $\mathcal{O}(R)$ sites.
Furthermore, we propose a Chern-Simons variant of these gauge theories,
yielding non-CSS type stabilizer codes, and propose the exploration of
exponentially symmetric subsystem SPTs and fracton codes in 3+1D.

<h3>Optimization strategies developed on NiO for Heisenberg exchange  coupling calculations using projector augmented wave based first-principles  DFT+U+J</h3>

High-performance batteries, heterogeneous catalysts and next-generation
photovoltaics often centrally involve transition metal oxides (TMOs) that
undergo charge or spin-state changes. Demand for accurate DFT modeling of TMOs
has increased in recent years, driving improved quantification and correction
schemes for approximate DFT's characteristic errors, notably those pertaining
to self-interaction and static correlation. Of considerable interest,
meanwhile, is the use of DFT-accessible quantities to compute parameters of
coarse-grained models such as for magnetism. To understand the interference of
error corrections and model mappings, we probe the prototypical Mott-Hubbard
insulator NiO, calculating its electronic structure in its antiferromagnetic
I/II and ferromagnetic states. We examine the pronounced sensitivity of the
first principles calculated Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters to choices
concerning Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) based population analysis, we
reevaluate spin quantification conventions for the Heisenberg model, and we
seek to develop best practices for calculating Hubbard parameters specific to
energetically meta-stable magnetic orderings of TMOs. Within this framework, we
assess several corrective functionals using in situ calculated U and J
parameters, e.g., DFT+U and DFT+U+J. We find that while using a straightforward
workflow with minimal empiricism, the NiO Heisenberg parameter RMS error with
respect to experiment was reduced to 13%, an advance upon the state-of-the-art.
Methodologically, we used a linear-response implementation for calculating the
Hubbard U available in the open-source plane-wave DFT code Abinit. We have
extended its utility to calculate the Hund's exchange coupling J, however our
findings are anticipated to be applicable to any DFT+U implementation.

<h3>Broken-symmetry magnetic phases in two-dimensional triangulene crystals</h3>

<i>G. Catarina, J. C. G. Henriques, A. Molina-S√°nchez, A. T. Costa, J. Fern√°ndez-Rossier</i>
<br>
<br>
We provide a comprehensive theory of magnetic phases in two-dimensional
triangulene crystals, using both Hubbard model and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. We consider centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric
triangulene crystals. In all cases, DFT and mean-field Hubbard model predict
the emergence of broken-symmetry antiferromagnetic (ferrimagnetic) phases for
the centrosymmetric (non-centrosymmetric) crystals. This includes the special
case of the [4,4]triangulene crystal, whose non-interacting energy bands
feature a gap with flat valence and conduction bands. We show how the lack of
contrast between the local density of states of these bands, recently measured
via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, is a natural consequence of a
broken-symmetry N\'eel state that blocks intermolecular hybridization. Using
random phase approximation, we also compute the spin wave spectrum of these
crystals, including the recently synthesized [4,4]triangulene crystal. The
results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of a Heisenberg spin
model derived from multi-configuration calculations for the unit cell. We
conclude that experimental results are compatible with an antiferromagnetically
ordered phase where each triangulene retains the spin predicted for the
isolated species.

Triangulenes are open-shell triangular graphene flakes with total spin
increasing with their size. In the last years, on-surface-synthesis strategies
have permitted fabricating and engineering triangulenes of various sizes and
structures with atomic precision. However, direct proof of the increasing total
spin with their size remains elusive. In this work, we report the combined
in-solution and on-surface synthesis of a large nitrogen-doped triangulene
(aza-[5]-triangulene) and the detection of its high spin ground state on a
Au(111) surface. Bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy images uncovered
radical states distributed along the zigzag edges, which were detected as weak
zero-bias resonances in scanning tunneling spectra. These spectral features
reveal the partial Kondo screening of a high spin state. Through a combination
of several simulation tools, we find that the observed distribution of radical
states is explained by a quintet ground state (S = 2), instead of the expected
quartet state (S = 3/2), confirming the positively charged state of the
molecule on the surface. We further provide a qualitative description of the
change of (anti)aromaticity introduced by N-substitution, and its role in the
charge stabilization on a surface, resulting in a S = 2 aza-[5]-triangulene on
Au(111).
