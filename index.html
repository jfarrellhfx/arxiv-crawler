In active nematic liquid crystals activity is able to drive chaotic
spatiotemporal flows referred to as active turbulence. Active turbulence has
been characterized through theoretical and experimental work as a low Reynolds
number phenomenon. We show that, in two-dimensions, the active forcing alone is
able to trigger hydrodynamic turbulence leading to the coexistence of active
and inertial turbulence. This type of flows develops for sufficiently active
and extensile flow-aligning nematics. We observe that the combined effect of an
extensile nematic and large values of the flow-aligning parameter leads to a
broadening of the elastic energy spectrum that promotes a growth of kinetic
energy able to trigger an inverse energy cascade.

<h3>Is Cu$_{3-x}$P a semiconductor, a metal, or a semimetal?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16686" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16686</a>

Despite the recent surge in interest in Cu$_{3-x}$P for catalysis, batteries,
and plasmonics, the electronic nature of Cu$_{3-x}$P remains unclear. Some
studies have shown evidence of semiconducting behavior, whereas others have
argued that Cu$_{3-x}$P is a metallic compound. Here, we attempt to resolve
this dilemma on the basis of combinatorial thin-film experiments, electronic
structure calculations, and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. We find
strong evidence that stoichiometric, defect-free Cu$_3$P is an intrinsic
semimetal, i.e., a material with a small overlap between the valence and the
conduction band. On the other hand, experimentally realizable Cu$_{3-x}$P films
are always p-type semimetals natively doped by copper vacancies regardless of
$x$. It is not implausible that Cu$_{3-x}$P samples with very small
characteristic sizes (such as small nanoparticles) are semiconductors due to
quantum confinement effects that result in opening of a band gap. We observe
high hole mobilities (276 cm$^2$/Vs) in Cu$_{3-x}$P films at low temperatures,
pointing to low ionized impurity scattering rates in spite of a high doping
density. We report an optical effect equivalent to the Burstein-Moss shift, and
we assign an infrared absorption peak to bulk interband transitions rather than
to a surface plasmon resonance. From a materials processing perspective, this
study demonstrates the suitability of reactive sputter deposition for detailed
high-throughput studies of emerging metal phosphides.

<h3>Molecular dynamics simulations of active entangled polymers reptating  through a passive mesh</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16942" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16942</a>
<br>
<i>Andres R. Tejedor, Raquel Carracedo, Jorge Ram√≠rez</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work, we explore the dynamics of active entangled chains using
molecular dynamics simulations of a modified Kremer-Grest model. The active
chains are diluted in a mesh of very long passive linear chains, to avoid
constraint release effects, and an active force is applied to the monomers in a
way that it imparts a constant polar drift velocity along the primitive path.
The simulation results show that, over a wide range of activity values, the
conformational properties of the chains and the tubes are not affected, but the
dynamics of the chains are severely modified. Despite not having an explicit
tube, the simulations verify all the predictions of the theory about all
possible observables very accurately, including a diffusion coefficient that
becomes independent of the molecular weight at moderate values of the activity.
Overall, this work provides novel information on the study of active entangled
polymers, giving a route map for studying this phenomenon and an efficient way
of obtaining a polar activity that reproduces the physics of the active
reptation theory.

<h3>A comparative study of the structural, elastic, thermophysical, and  optoelectronic properties of CaZn$_2$X$_2$ (X = N, P, As) semiconductors via  ab-initio approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17275" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17275</a>
<br>
<i>Md. Sajidul Islam, Razu Ahmed, Md. Mahamudujjaman, R.S. Islam, S.H. Naqib</i>
<br>
<br>
We present a detailed density functional theory based calculations of the
structural, elastic, lattice dynamical, thermophysical, and optoelectronic
properties of ternary semiconductors CaZn$_2$X$_2$ (X = N, P, As) in this
paper. The obtained lattice parameters are in excellent agreement with the
experimental values and other theoretical findings. These elastic constants
satisfy the mechanical stability criteria. Moreover, many thermophysical
parameters of these compounds are estimated, including the Debye temperature,
average sound velocity, melting temperature, heat capacity, lattice thermal
conductivity, etc. The comprehensive analysis of the elastic constants and
moduli show that CaZn$_2$X$_2$ compounds possess reasonably good machinability,
relatively high Vickers hardness and relatively low Debye temperature. The
phonon dispersion curves and phonon density of states are investigated for the
first time for the compounds CaZn$_2$P$_2$ and CaZn$_2$As$_2$. It is observed
from the phonon dispersion curves that the bulk CaZn$_2$X$_2$ (X = N, P, As)
compounds are dynamically stable. Electronic properties have been studied
through the band structures and electronic energy density of states. The
electronic band structures show that CaZn$_2$N$_2$ and CaZn$_2$As$_2$ possess
direct band gaps while the compound CaZn$_2$P$_2$ show indirect band gap. The
bonding characters of CaZn$_2$X$_2$ (X = N, P, As) compounds are investigated.
Energy dependent optical parameters exhibit good correspondence with the
electronic energy density of states features. We have thoroughly discussed the
reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index, dielectric function,
optical conductivity and loss function of these semiconductors. The optical
absorption, reflectivity spectra and the refractive index of CaZn$_2$X$_2$ (X =
N, P, As) show that the compounds hold promise to be used in optoelectronic
devices.

<h3>Resonating valence bond states and other surprises in an electron-phonon  system</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16321" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16321</a>

We study a simple electron-phonon model on square and triangular versions of
the Lieb-lattice using an asymptotically exact strong coupling analysis. At
zero temperature and electron density $n = 1$ (one electron per unit cell), for
various ranges of parameters in the model, we exploit a mapping to the quantum
dimer model to establish the existence of a spin-liquid phase with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order (on the triangular lattice) and a
multi-critical line corresponding to a quantum critical spin liquid (on the
square lattice). In the remaining part of the phase diagram, we find a host of
charge-density-wave phases (e.g. valence-bond crystals), a conventional s-wave
superconducting phase, and with the addition of a small Hubbard $U$ to tip the
balance, a phonon-induced d-wave superconducting phase. Under a special
condition, we find a hidden pseudo-spin $SU(2)$ symmetry that implies an exact
constraint on the superconducting order parameters.

<h3>Symmetry protected topological phases under decoherence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16323" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16323</a>

We study a class of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases under various
types of decoherence, which can drive a pure SPT state into a mixed state. We
demonstrate that the system can still retain the nontrivial topological
information from the SPT ground state even under decoherence, which can arise
from noise or weak measurement. The main quantity that we investigate is the
``strange correlator" proposed previously as a diagnosis for the SPT ground
states, and in this work, we generalize the notion of the strange correlator to
mixed-state density matrices. Using both exact calculations of the stabilizer
Hamiltonians and field theory evaluations, we demonstrate that under
decoherence the nontrivial features of the SPT state can persist in the two
types of strange correlators: type-I and type-II. We show that the nontrivial
type-I strange correlator corresponds to the presence of the SPT information
that can be efficiently identified from experiments, as well as the persistence
of anomalous boundary physics. The nontrivial type-II strange correlator
corresponds to the presence of the original SPT information in the density
matrix, which in principle can be identified to distinguish decohered mixed
states of an SPT and trivial states. Therefore, our work provides a unified
framework to understand decohered SPT phases from the information-theoretic
viewpoint.

<h3>Triplet Pair-Density Wave Superconductivity on the $œÄ$-flux Square  Lattice</h3>

Pair-density waves (PDW) are superconducting states that spontaneously break
translation symmetry in systems with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Evidence for
PDW has been seen in several recent experiments, as well as in the pseudogap
regime in cuprates. Theoretical understanding of PDW has been largely
restricted to phenomenological and numerical studies, while microscopic
theories typically require strong-coupling or fine-tuning. In this work, we
provide a novel symmetry-based mechanism under which PDW emerges as a weak
coupling instability of a 2D TRS metal. Combining mean-field and
renormalization group analyses, we identify a weak-coupling instability towards
a triplet PDW realized in the $\pi$-flux square lattice model with on-site
repulsion and moderate nearest-neighbor attraction when the Fermi level crosses
Van Hove singularities at 1/4 and 3/4 fillings. This PDW is protected by the
magnetic translation symmetries characteristic of Hofstadter systems, of which
the $\pi$-flux lattice is a special time-reversal symmetric case.

<h3>Jamming and Unusual Charge Density Fluctuations of Strange Metals</h3>

The strange metallic regime across a number of high-temperature
superconducting materials presents numerous challenges to the classic theory of
Fermi liquid metals. Recent measurements of the dynamical charge response of
strange metals, including optimally doped cuprates, have revealed a broad,
featureless continuum of excitations, extending over much of the Brillouin
zone. The collective density oscillations of this strange metal ("plasmon")
decay into the continuum in a manner that is at odds with the expectations of
Fermi liquid theory. Inspired by these observations, we investigate the
phenomenology of bosonic collective modes and the particle-hole excitations in
a class of strange metals by making an analogy to the phonons of classical
lattices falling apart across an unconventional jamming-like transition
associated with the onset of rigidity. By making comparisons to the
experimentally measured dynamical response functions, we reproduce many of the
qualitative features using the above framework. We conjecture that the dynamics
of electronic charge density over an intermediate range of energy scales in a
class of strongly correlated metals can be at the brink of a jamming
transition.

<h3>Field-free-switching state diagram of perpendicular magnetization  subjected to conventional and unconventional spin-orbit torques</h3>

The lack of certain crystalline symmetries in strong spin-orbit-coupled
non-magnetic materials allows for the existence of uncoventional spin Hall
responses, with electrically generated transverse spin currents possessing
collinear flow and spin directions. The injection of such spin currents into an
adjacent ferromagnetic layer can excite magnetization dynamics via
unconventional spin-orbit torques, leading to deterministic switching in
ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We study the interplay
between conventional and unconventional spin-orbit torques on the magnetization
dynamics of a perpendicular ferromagnet in the small intrinsic damping limit,
and identify a rich set of dynamical regimes that includes deterministic and
probabilistic switching, precessional and pinning states. Contrary to common
belief, we found that there exists a critical conventional spin Hall angle,
beyond which deterministic magnetization switching transitions to a
precessional or pinned state. Conversely, we showed that larger unconventional
spin Hall angle is generally beneficial for deterministic switching. We derive
an approximate expression that qualitatively describes the state diagram
boundary between the full deterministic switching and precessional states and
discuss a criterion for searching symmetry-broken spin Hall materials in order
to maximize switching efficiency. Our work offers a roadmap towards energy
efficient spintronic devices, which might opens doors for applications in
advanced in-memory computing technologies.

High quality n-type AlGaAs distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) and lnGaAs
multiple quantum wells were successfully monolithically grown on 4-inch off-cut
Ge (100) wafers. The grown structures have photoluminescence spectra and
reflectance spectra comparable to those grown on conventional bulk GaAs wafers
and have smooth morphology and reasonable uniformity. These results strongly
support full VCSEL growth and fabrication on larger-area bulk Ge substrates for
the mass production of AlGaAs-based VCSELs.

<h3>Emergence of Layer Stacking Disorder in c-axis Confined MoTe$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The layer stacking order in 2D materials strongly affects functional
properties and holds promise for next generation electronic devices. In bulk,
octahedral MoTe$_2$ possesses two stacking arrangements, the Weyl semimetal
T$_d$ phase, and the higher-order topological insulator 1T' phase; however, it
remains unclear if thin exfoliated flakes of MoTe$_2$ follow the T$_d$, 1T', or
an alternative stacking sequence. Here, we resolve this debate using
atomic-resolution imaging within the transmission electron microscope. We find
that the layer stacking in thin flakes of MoTe$_2$ is highly disordered and
pseudo-random, which we attribute to intrinsic confinement effects. Conversely,
WTe$_2$, which is isostructural and isoelectronic to MoTe$_2$, displays ordered
stacking even for thin exfoliated flakes. Our results are important for
understanding the quantum properties of MoTe$_2$ devices, and suggest that
thickness may be used to alter the layer stacking in other 2D materials.

<h3>Semimetallic and semiconducting graphene-hBN multilayers with parallel  or reverse stacking</h3>

<br>

We theoretically investigate 3D layered crystals of alternating graphene and
hBN layers with different symmetries. Depending on the hopping parameters
between the graphene layers, we find that these synthetic 3D materials can
feature semimetallic, gapped, or Weyl semimetal phases. Our results demonstrate
that 3D crystals stacked from individual 2D materials represent a new materials
class with emergent properties different from their constituents.

<br>
<br>
In the quest of new materials that can withstand severe irradiation and
mechanical extremes for advanced applications (e.g. fission reactors, fusion
devices, space applications, etc), design, prediction and control of advanced
materials beyond current material designs become a paramount goal. Here, though
a combined experimental and simulation methodology, the design of a new
nanocrystalline refractory high entropy alloy (RHEA) system is established.
Compositions of this alloy, assessed under extreme environments and in situ
electron-microscopy, revealed both high mechanical strength and thermal
stability, grain refinement under heavy ion irradiation and outstanding
irradiation resistance to dual-beam irradiation and helium implantation, marked
by remarkable resistance to defect generation, growth and coalescence. The
experimental and modeling results, which demonstrated notable agreement, can be
applied to design and rapidly assess other alloys subjected to extreme
environmental conditions.

<h3>Tuning the conductance topology in solids</h3>

The inertia of trapping and detrapping of nonequilibrium charge carriers
affects the transport properties of both bulk and nanoscopic structures in a
very peculiar way. An emerging memory response with a hysteresis in the
current-voltage response and its eventual multiple crossing, produced by this
universally available ingredient, are signatures of this process. Here, we
deliver a microscopic and analytical solution for these behaviors, understood
as the modulation of the topology of the current-voltage loops. The memory
emergence becomes thus a characterization tool for intrinsic features that
affect the electronic transport of solids such as the nature and number of
trapping sites, intrinsic symmetry constraints, and natural relaxation time
scales. This method is also able to reduce the seeming complexity of
frequency-dependent impedance observable for a variety of systems to a
combination of simple microscopic ingredients.

<h3>Coupling between colossal charge density wave ordering and magnetism in  Ho2Ir3Si5</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16445" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16445</a>

<br>
<br>
Ho2Ir3Si5 belongs to the family of three-dimensional (3D) R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu,
Er and Ho) compounds that exhibit a colossal first-order charge density wave
(CDW) transition where there is a strong orthorhombic-to-triclinic distortion
of the lattice accompanied by superlattice reflections. The analysis by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) has revealed that the Ir-Ir zigzag
chains along c are responsible for the CDW in all three compounds. The
replacement of the rare earth element from non-magnetic Lu to magnetic Er or Ho
lowers TCDW, where TCDWLu = 200 K, TCDWEr = 150 K and TCDWHo = 90 K. Out of the
three compounds, Ho2Ir3Si5 is the only system where second-order superlattice
reflections could be observed, indicative of an anharmonic shape of the
modulation wave. The CDW transition is observed as anomalies in the temperature
dependencies of the specific heat, electrical conductivity and magnetic
susceptibility, which includes a large hysteresis of 90 to 130 K for all
measured properties, thus corroborating the SXRD measurements. Similar to
previously reported Er2Ir3Si5, there appears to be a coupling between CDW and
magnetism such that the Ho3+ magnetic moments are influenced by the CDW
transition, even in the paramagnetic state. Moreover, earlier investigations on
polycrystalline material revealed antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at TN = 5.1
K, whereas AFM order is suppressed and only the CDW is present in our highly
ordered single-crystal. First-principles calculations predict Ho2Ir3Si5 to be a
metal with coexisting electron and hole pockets at the Fermi level. The Ho and
Ir atoms have spherically symmetric metallic-type charge density distributions
that are prone to CDW distortion. Phonon calculations affirm that the Ir atoms
are primarily responsible for the CDW distortion, which is in agreement with
the experiment.

<h3>Thermal transport properties of IrSbSe</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16447" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16447</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Liu, Milinda Abeykoon, Niraj Aryal, David Graf, Zhixiang Hu, Weiguo Yin, C. Petrovic</i>
<br>
<br>
We report a thermal transport study of IrSbSe, which crystallizes in a
noncentrosymmetric cubic structure with the $P2_13$ space group and shows a
narrow-gap semiconducting behavior. The large discrepancy between the
activation energy for conductivity [$E_\rho$ = 128(2) meV] and for thermopower
[$E_S$ = 17.7(9) meV] from 200 to 300 K indicates the polaronic transport
mechanism. Electrical resistivity varies as $exp(T_0/T)^{1/4}$ and thermopower
varies as $T^{1/2}$ at low temperatures, indicating that it evolves into the
Mott's variable-range hopping dominant conduction with decreasing temperature.
IrSbSe shows relatively low value of thermal conductivity ($\sim$ 1.65
W/K$\cdot$m) and thermopower of about 0.24 mV/K around 100 K, yet poor
electrical conductivity. On the other hand, high vacancy defect concentration
on both Ir and Sb atomic sites of up to 15\%, suggests high defect tolerance
and points to possibility of future improvement of carrier density by chemical
substitution or defect optimization.

<h3>On the creation of near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centre ensembles by  implantation of type Ib diamond</h3>

<br>
<br>
Dense, near-surface (within 10 nm) ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres
in diamond are rapidly moving into prominence as the workhorse of a variety of
envisaged applications, ranging from the imaging of fast-fluctuating magnetic
signals to the facilitation of nuclear hyperpolarisation. Unlike their bulk
counterparts, near-surface ensembles suffer from charge stability issues and
reduced NV formation efficiency due to the diamond surface's role as a vacancy
sink during annealing and an electron sink afterwards. To this end, work is
ongoing to determine the best methods for producing high-quality ensembles in
this regime. Here we examine the prospects for creating such ensembles
cost-effectively by implanting nitrogen-rich type Ib diamond with electron
donors, aiming to exploit the high bulk nitrogen density to combat
surface-induced band bending in the process. This approach has previously been
successful at creating deeper ensembles, however we find that in the
near-surface regime there are fewer benefits over nitrogen implantation into
pure diamond substrates. Our results suggest that control over diamond surface
termination during annealing is key to successfully creating high-yield
near-surface NV ensembles generally, and implantation into type Ib diamond may
be worth revisiting once that has been accomplished.

<h3>Remarkable enhancement in catechol sensing by the decoration of  selective transition metals in biphenylene sheet: A systematic  first-principles study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16483" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16483</a>
<br>
<i>Vikram Mahamiya, Juhee Dewangan, Alok Shukla, Brahmananda Chakraborty</i>
<br>
<br>
Motivated by the recent successful synthesis of biphenylene structure
[Science 372, (2021), 852], we have explored the sensing properties of this
material towards the catechol biomolecule by performing the first-principles
density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Pristine
biphenylene sheet adsorbs catechol molecule with a binding energy of -0.35 eV,
which can be systematically improved by decorating the transition metals (Ag,
Au, Pd, and Ti) at various possible sites of biphenylene. It is observed that
the catechol molecule is adsorbed on Pd and Ti-decorated biphenylene sheets
with strong adsorption energies of -1.00 eV and -2.54 eV, respectively. The
interaction of the catechol molecule with biphenylene and metal-decorated
biphenylene is due to the charge transfer from the O-2p orbitals of the
catechol molecule to the C-2p orbitals of biphenylene and d-orbitals of metals
in metal-decorated biphenylene, respectively. From the Bader charge
calculation, we found that 0.05e amount of charge is transferred from the
catechol molecule to pristine biphenylene, which gets almost double (~0.1e) for
the Ti-decorated biphenylene sheet. The diffusion energy barrier for the
clustering of the Pd and Ti atoms comes out to be 2.39 eV and 4.29 eV, computed
by performing the climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations. We found
that the catechol molecule gets desorbed from the pristine biphenylene sheet
even at 100 K but remains attached to metal (Pd, Ti) decorated biphenylene
sheets at room temperature by performing the ab-initio molecular dynamics
simulations. The Ti-decorated biphenylene sheet has more sensitivity toward
catechol adsorption while the Pd-decorated biphenylene sheet has a suitable
recovery time at 500 K. The results suggest that the Pd and Ti-decorated
biphenylene sheets are promising materials for catechol detection.

Neural network quantum states (NQS), incorporating with variational Monte
Carlo (VMC) method, are shown to be a promising way to investigate quantum
many-body physics. Whereas vanilla VMC methods perform one gradient update per
sample, we introduce a novel objective function with proximal optimization (PO)
that enables multiple updates via reusing the mismatched samples. Our VMC-PO
method keeps the advantage of the previous importance sampling gradient
optimization algorithm [L. Yang, {\it et al}, Phys. Rev. Research {\bf 2},
012039(R)(2020)] that efficiently uses sampled states. PO mitigates the
numerical instabilities during network updates, which is similar to stochastic
reconfiguration (SR) methods, but achieves an alternative and simpler implement
with lower computational complexity. We investigate the performance of our
VMC-PO algorithm for ground-state searching with a 1-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model and 2-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a
square lattice, and demonstrate that the reached ground-state energies are
comparable to state-of-the-art results.

The long-sought Chern insulators that manifest quantum anomalous Hall effect
are typically considered to occur solely in ferromagnets. Here, we
theoretically predict the realizability of Chern insulators in
antiferromagnets, of which the magnetic sublattices are connected by symmetry
operators enforcing zero net moment. Our symmetry analysis provides
comprehensive magnetic layer point groups that allow antiferromagnetic (AFM)
Chern insulators, and reveals that in-plane magnetic configuration is required.
Followed by first-principles calculations, such design principles naturally
lead to two categories of material candidates, exemplified by RbCr2S4 and Mn3Sn
thin films with collinear and noncollinear AFM orders, respectively. We further
show that the Chern number could be tuned by slight ferromagnetic canting as an
effective pivot. Our work elucidates the nature of Chern-insulator phase in AFM
systems, paving a new avenue for the search and design of quantum anomalous
Hall insulators with the integration of non-dissipative transport and the
promising advantages of the AFM order.

Mechanical deformations in $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattices induce local
pseudomagnetic fields of opposite directionality for different valleys. When
this strain is equipped with a dynamical drive, it generates a complementary
valley-asymmetric pseudoelectric field which is expected to accelerate
electrons. We propose that by combining these effects by a time-dependent
nonuniform strain, tunable valley filtering devices can be engineered that
extend beyond the static capabilities. We demonstrate this by implementing an
oscillating Gaussian bump centered in a four-terminal Hall bar
$\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ setup and calculating the induced
pseudoelectromagnetic fields analytically. Within a recursive Floquet
Green-function scheme, we determine the time-averaged transmission and valley
polarization, as well as the spatial distributions of the local density of
states and current density. As a result of the periodic drive, we detect novel
energy regimes with highly valley-polarized transmission, depending on
$\alpha$. Analyzing the spatial profiles of the time-averaged local density of
states and current density we can relate these regimes to the
pseudoelectromagnetic fields in the setup.By means of the driving frequency, we
can manipulate the valley-polarized states, which might be advantageous for
future device applications.

<br>
In the present study, we have discussed the up-turn behavior in the
resistivity pattern of the topological nodal line semimetal InBi. We argued
that such nature could be generalized with a mathematical model, that can be
applied to any compounds exhibiting similar behavior. The extremely high
magnetoresistance (XMR) has also been explained by the carrier compensation in
the compound, estimated from the Hall conductivity. Moreover, from the study of
Subhnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation and density functional theory (DFT), we
obtained the complete three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface topology of the
compound InBi. A detailed understanding of carriers' behavior has been
discussed using those studies. We have also unfurled the topology of each
electron and hole pocket and its possible modulation with electron and hole
doping.

<h3>General Theory for Bilayer Stacking Ferroelectricity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16542" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16542</a>

<br>
<br>
Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, which is rare in nature, enable
high-density non-volatile memory with low energy consumption. Here, we propose
a theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity (BSF), in which, two stacked
layers of the same 2D material, with different rotation and translation,
exhibits ferroelectricity. By performing systematic group theory analysis, we
find out all the possible BSF in all the 80 layer groups (LGs) and discover the
rules about the creation and annihilation of symmetries in the bilayer. Our
general theory can not only explain all the previous findings (including
sliding ferroelectricity), but also provide new perspective. Interestingly, the
direction of the electric polarization of the bilayer could be totally
different from that of the single layer. In particular, the bilayer could
become ferroelectric after properly stacking two centrosymmetric non-polar
monolayers. By means of first-principles simulations, we demonstrate that the
ferroelectricity and thus multiferroicity can be introduced to the prototypical
2D ferromagnetic centrosymmetric material CrI3 by stacking. Furthermore, we
find that the out-of-plane electric polarization in bilayer CrI3 is interlocked
with the in-plane electric polarization, suggesting that the out-of-plane
polarization can be manipulated in a deterministic way through the application
of an in-plane electric field. The present BSF theory lays a solid foundation
for designing a large number of bilayer ferroelectrics and thus colorful
platforms for fundamental studies and applications.

<br>
Mn2+-doped semiconductor nanocrystals with tuned location and concentration
of Mn2+ ions can yield diverse coupling regimes, which can highly influence
their optical properties such as emission wavelength and photoluminescence (PL)
lifetime. However, investigation on the relationship between the Mn2+
concentration and the optical properties is still challenging because of the
complex interactions of Mn2+ ions and the host and between the Mn2+ ions. Here,
atomically flat ZnS nanoplatelets (NPLs) with uniform thickness were chosen as
matrixes for Mn2+ doping. Using time-resolved (TR) PL spectroscopy and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, a connection between coupling and PL
kinetics of Mn2+ ions was established.
Moreover, it was found that the Mn2+ ions residing on the surface of a
nanostructure produce emissive states and interfere with the change of
properties by Mn2+/Mn2+ coupling.
In a configuration with suppressed surface contribution to the optical
response we show the underlying physical reasons for double and triple
exponential decay by DFT methods. We believe that the presented doping strategy
and simulation methodology of the Mn2+-doped ZnS system is a universal platform
to study dopant location- and concentration-dependent properties also in other
semiconductors.

<br>
<br>
Combined with first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann
transport theory, Janus {\alpha}-STe2 and {\alpha}-SeTe2 monolayers are
investigated systematically. Janus {\alpha}-STe2 and {\alpha}-SeTe2 monolayers
are indirect semiconductors with band gaps of 1.20 and 0.96 eV. It is found
they possess ultrahigh figure of merit (ZT) values of 3.9 and 4.4 at 500 K,
much higher than that of the pristine {\alpha}-Te monolayer (2.8). The higher
ZT originates from Janus structures reduce lattice thermal conductivities
remarkably compared with pristine {\alpha}-Te monolayer. The much higher phonon
anharmonicity in Janus monolayers leads to significant lower lattice thermal
conductivity. It is also found electronic thermal conductivity can play an
important role in thermoelectric efficiency for the materials with quite low
lattice thermal conductivity. This work suggests the potential applications of
Janus {\alpha}-STe2 and {\alpha}-SeTe2 monolayers as thermoelectric materials
and highlights Janus structure as an effective way to enhance thermoelectric
performance.

<br>
<br>
Next-generation implantable computational devices require long-term stable
electronic components capable of operating in, and interacting with,
electrolytic surroundings without being damaged. Organic electrochemical
transistors (OECTs) emerged as fitting candidates. However, while single
devices feature impressive figures of merit, integrated circuits (ICs) immersed
in a common electrolytes are hard to realize using electrochemical transistors,
and there is no clear path forward for optimal top-down circuit design and
high-density integration. The simple observation that two OECTs immersed in the
same electrolytic medium will inevitably interact hampers their implementation
in complex circuitry. The electrolyte's ionic conductivity connects all the
devices in the liquid, producing unwanted and often unforeseeable dynamics.
Minimizing or harnessing this crosstalk has been the focus of very recent
studies.
In this Perspective, we discuss the main challenges, trends, and
opportunities for realizing OECT-based circuitry in a liquid environment that
could circumnavigate the hard limits of engineering and human physiology. We
analyze the most successful approaches in autonomous bioelectronics and
information processing. Elaborating on the strategies to circumvent and harness
device crosstalk proves that platforms capable of complex computation and even
machine learning can be realized in-liquido using mixed ionic-electronic
conductors.

<h3>Multibody expansion of the local integrals of motion: How many pairs of  particle-hole do we really need to describe the quasiparticles in the  many-body localized phase?</h3>

<br>
<i>Z. Gholami, M. Amini, M. Soltani, E. Ghanbari-Adivi</i>
<br>
<br>
The emergent integrability in a many-body localized (MBL) system can be well
characterized by the existence of the complete set of local integrals of motion
(LIOMs). Such exactly conserved and exponentially localized operators are often
understood as quasiparticle operators which can be expanded in terms of
single-particle operators dressed with different numbers of particle-hole
pairs. Here, we consider a one-dimensional XXZ spin-$\frac12$ Heisenberg chain
in the presence of a random field and try to quantify the corrections needed to
be considered in the picture of quasiparticles associated with LIOMs due to the
presence of particle-hole excitations. To this end, we explicitly present the
multibody expansion of LIOM creation operators of the system in the MBL regime.
We analytically obtain the coefficients of this expansion and discuss the
effect of higher-order corrections associated with different numbers of
particle-hole excitations. Our analysis shows that depending on the
localization length of the system, there exist a regime in which the
contributions that come from higher-order terms can break down the effective
one-particle description of the LIOMs and such quasiparticles become
essentially many-body-like.

<h3>Topological symplectic Kondo effect</h3>

Strongly correlated systems with the ability to harbor anyonic
quasi-particles are of primary importance both for fundamental scientific
interest and for quantum information technology. Specifically, the
multi-channel and the topological Kondo effects were advocated in this context,
however they require either perfect channel symmetry or the use of Majorana
fermions. Here we propose a Majorana-free mesoscopic setup which implements the
Kondo effect of the symplectic Lie group and can harbor emergent anyons
(including Majorana fermions, Fibonacci anyons, and $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions)
even in the absence of perfect channel symmetry. In addition to the detailed
prescription of the implementation, we present the strong coupling solution by
mapping the model to the multi-channel Kondo effect associated to an internal
$SU(2)$ symmetry and exploit conformal field theory (CFT) to predict the
non-trivial scaling of a variety of observables, including conductance, as a
function of temperature. This work does not only open the door for robust
Kondo-based topological quantum computation, but also sheds light on the
physics of strongly correlated materials with competing order parameters.

<br>
Surface energy is a fundamental property of materials and is particularly
important in describing nanomaterials where atoms or molecules at the surface
constitute a large fraction of the material. Traditionally, surface energy is
considered to be a positive quantity, where atoms or molecules at the surface
are less thermodynamically stable than their counterparts in the interior of
the material because they have fewer bonds or interactions at the surface.
Using calorimetric methods, we show that the surface energy is negative in some
prototypical colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots with organic
ligand coatings. This implies that the surface atoms are more thermodynamically
stable than those on the interior due to the strong bonds between these atoms
and surfactant molecules, or ligands, that coat their surface. In addition, we
extend this work to core/shell indium phosphide/zinc sulfide nanocrystals and
show that the interfacial energy between these materials is highly
thermodynamically favorable in spite of their large lattice mismatch. This work
challenges many of the assumptions that have guided thinking about colloidal
nanomaterial thermodynamics, illustrates the fundamental stability of many
technologically relevant colloidal nanomaterials, and paves the way for future
experimental and theoretical work on nanocrystal thermodynamics.

<h3>Peculiarities of the local structure in new medium- and high-entropy,  low-symmetry tungstates</h3>

New monoclinic ($P2$/$c$) tungstates - a medium-entropy tungstate,
(Mn,Ni,Cu,Zn)WO$_4$, and a high-entropy tungstate, (Mn,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn)WO$_4$ -
were synthesized and characterized. Their phase purity and solid solution
nature were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray
absorption spectroscopy was used to probe the local structure around metal
cations. The atomic structures based on the ideal solid solution model were
optimized by a simultaneous analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine
structure spectra at multiple metal absorption edges - five for
(Mn,Ni,Cu,Zn)WO$_4$ and six for (Mn,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn)WO$_4$ - by means of reverse
Monte Carlo simulations. In both compounds, Ni$^{2+}$ ions have the strongest
tendency to organize their local environment and form slightly distorted
[NiO$_6$] octahedra, whereas Mn$^{2+}$, Co$^{2+}$, and Zn$^{2+}$ ions have a
strongly distorted octahedral coordination. The most intriguing result is that
the shape of [CuO$_6$] octahedra in (Mn,Ni,Cu,Zn)WO$_4$ and
(Mn,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn)WO$_4$ differs from that found in pure CuWO$_4$, where a strong
Jahn-Teller distortion is present: [CuO$_6$] octahedra become more regular with
increasing degree of dilution.

We introduce GlassMLP, a machine learning framework using physics-informed

liquids. We apply this deep neural network to atomistic models in 2D and 3D.
Its performance is better than the state of the art while being more
parsimonious in terms of training data and fitting parameters. GlassMLP
quantitatively predicts four-point dynamic correlations and the geometry of
dynamic heterogeneity. Its transferability from small to large system sizes
allows us to probe the temperature evolution of spatial dynamic correlations,

<h3>Electronic transport in graphene with out-of-plane disorder</h3>

<br>
<br>
Real-world samples of graphene often exhibit various types of out-of-plane
disorder -- ripples, wrinkles and folds -- introduced at the stage of growth
and transfer processes. These complex out-of-plane defects resulting from the
interplay between self-adhesion of graphene and its bending rigidity inevitably
lead to the scattering of charge carriers thus affecting the electronic
transport properties of graphene. We address the ballistic charge-carrier
transmission across the models of out-of-plane defects using tight-binding and
density functional calculations while fully taking into account lattice
relaxation effects. The observed transmission oscillations in commensurate
graphene wrinkles are attributed to the interference between intra- and
interlayer transport channels, while the incommensurate wrinkles show vanishing
backscattering and retain the transport properties of flat graphene. The
suppression of backscattering reveals the crucial role of lattice
commensuration in the electronic transmission. Our results provide guidelines
to controlling the transport properties of graphene in presence of this
ubiquitous type of disorder.

<h3>Path-integral approaches to strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems</h3>

<br>
<br>
The core of this thesis is the path-integral formulation of quantum field
theory and its ability to describe strongly-coupled quantum many-body systems
of finite size. Collective behaviors can be efficiently described in such
systems through the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in
mean-field approaches. However, as the thermodynamic limit does not make sense
in finite-size systems, the latter can not exhibit any SSB and the symmetries
which are broken down at the mean-field level must therefore be restored. The
efficiency of theoretical approaches in the treatment of finite-size quantum
systems can therefore be studied via their ability to restore spontaneously
broken symmetries. In this thesis, a zero-dimensional $O(N)$ model is taken as
a theoretical laboratory to perform such an investigation with many
state-of-the-art path-integral techniques: perturbation theory combined with
various resummation methods (Pad\'e-Borel, Borel-hypergeometric, conformal
mapping), enhanced versions of perturbation theory (transseries derived via
Lefschetz thimbles, optimized perturbation theory), self-consistent
perturbation theory based on effective actions (auxiliary field loop expansion
(LOAF), Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism, 4PPI effective action, ...),
functional renormalization group (FRG) techniques (FRG based on the Wetterich
equation, DFT-FRG, 2PI-FRG). Connections between these different techniques are
also emphasized. In addition, the path-integral formalism provides us with the
possibility to introduce collective degrees of freedom in an exact fashion via
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations: the effect of such transformations on all
the aforementioned methods is also examined in detail.

<br>
<br>
Ion-beam irradiation of an amorphizable material such as Si or Ge may lead to
spontaneous pattern formation beyond some critical angle of the beam versus the
surface. It is known from experimental results that this critical angle varies
according to beam energy, ion species and target material. However, most
prevailing theoretical analyses predict a critical angle of $45^{\circ}$
independent of energy, ion and target, disagreeing with experiment. In this
second part of a set of papers, we consider the influence of the relationship
between the upper and lower interfaces of the amorphous thin film (the
``interface relation"). From our previous work, we are motivated to derive from
a geometric argument closed-form expressions describing the interface relation
in terms of the collision cascade shape. This feature leads to a refined
characterization of the influence of ion-, target- and energy-dependence on
critical angle selection.

<i>Tyler Evans, Scott Norris</i>
<br>
<br>
Ion-beam irradiation of an amorphizable material such as Si or Ge may lead to
spontaneous pattern formation, rather than flat surfaces, for irradiation
beyond some critical angle against the surface normal. It is observed
experimentally that this critical angle varies according to many factors,
including beam energy, ion species and target material. In this first part of a
set of papers, we consider a composite model of stress-free strain and
isotropic swelling with a generalized treatment of stress modification along
idealized ion tracks. We obtain a highly-general linear stability result with a
careful treatment of arbitrary depth-dependence profiles for each of the
stress-free strain-rate tensor, a source of deviatoric stress modification, and
isotropic swelling, a source of isotropic stress. We compare our theoretical
results with experimental measurements of angle-dependent deviatoric and
isotropic stresses for 250eV Ar+ on Si. Our analysis suggests that the presence
of angle-independent isotropic stress and the relationship between the
amorphous-crystalline and free interfaces may be strong contributors to
critical angle selection, while the influence of inhomogeneous stress
modification is seemingly non-existent in the idealized case of
diagonally-translated interface and stress generated entirely along a thin,
down-beam ion track. We also consider an opposing idealization: that of
interfaces defined by vertical translation, with stress modification along the
vertical regardless of beam orientation. The unacceptable variability in
predictions resulting from these two idealizations, both of which have appeared
in recent analyses, prompts modeling refinements discussed in subsequent papers
in this set. These refinements include the relationship between interfaces and
a more sophisticated treatment of the inhomogeneous stress field.

<br>
<br>
Magnons are the quanta of collective spin excitations in magnetically-ordered
systems and manipulation of magnons for computing and information processing
has witnessed the development of ``magnonics". A magnon corresponds to an
excitation of the magnetic system from its ground state and the creation of a
magnon thus increases the total energy of the system. In this perspective, we
introduce the antiparticle of a magnon, dubbed the antimagnon, as an excitation
that lowers the magnetic energy. We investigate the stability and thermal
occupation of antimagnons and verify our theory by micromagnetic simulations.
Furthermore, we show how the concept of antimagnons yields a unified picture to
understand the magnonic analog of the Klein effect, magnonic black-hole
horizons, and magnonic black-hole lasing. Our work may stimulate fundamental
interest in antimagnons, as well as their applications to spintronic devices.

I discuss similitude and differences of spin-orbital effects for electrons in
quantum wells with the Rashba coupling and for polaritons in semiconductor
microcavities with TE-TM splitting. Contrary to the case of electron, the
ground state of polariton in the trap can be non-degenerate and can possess
specific polarization structure. For the case of azimuthally symmetric trap and
sufficiently strong spin-orbital coupling, the ground state is either radial or
azimuthal vortex, depending on the sign of the coupling constant. The effect is
strongly enhanced for polaritons trapped in a ring, where even weak TE-TM
splitting results in formation of vorticity and definite polarization of the
ground state. The Hamiltonian for quasi-1D motion of polaritons in the ring is
derived and it is shown the the dispersion of polaritons depend qualitatively
on the curvature of the ring.

Magnetic tunnel junctions with wide band gap semiconductor ZnTe barrier were
fabricated. A very low barrier height and sizable magnetoresistance were
observed in the Fe/ZnTe/Fe junctions at room temperature. The nonlinear I-V

spin-dependent tunneling effect. Temperature dependent study indicated that the
total conductance of the junction is dominated by direct tunneling, with only a
small portion from the hopping conduction through the defect states inside the
barrier.

Equation of state (EOS) for bcc tungsten at 300 K (or 3000 K) up to 1000 GPa
(or 300 GPa) was predicted for the first time by solving the partition function
via a direct integral approach (DIA) with ab initio calculations of the atoms'
interactions. Compared with available experiments under static compressions up
to 150 GPa (or 35 GPa) for room temperature (or 1673 K), all the calculated
results are within the experimental uncertainty achieved very recently.
Furthermore, the same procedure was performed to investigate the shock wave
experiments on the EOS up to 400 GPa and 10000 K, and the calculated average
pressure deviates the experimental measurements by only 2.0%. These facts
suggest that the other calculated results of DIA for the EOS are reliable, and
DIA as a universal method without any artificial parameters could be widely
applied to predict EOS of various materials under various conditions.

In intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (I-TMDC), transition metal
intercalation introduces magnetic phases which in some cases induce topological
band crossing. However, evidence of the topological properties remains elusive
in such materials. Here we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to
reveal the band structure of epitaxially grown ferromagnetic Cr1/3NbSe2.
Experimental evidence of the Weyl crossing shows Cr1/3NbSe2 to be a topological
ferromagnet. This work highlights I-TMDC as platform towards the interplay of
magnetic and topological physics in low-dimensional systems.

The thermal conductivity study on the pyrochlore structured ceramics is
important for utilization of these materials as an inert matrix fuel,
electrolytes for oxide fuel cell and thermal barrier coating. The impact of
porosity, structural defects and boundary scattering on thermal properties of
the nanocrystalline Gd2Ti2O7 fabricated by spark plasma sintering followed by
high energy ball milling has been investigated. The thermal conductivity has
been measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 900 C using
laser flash apparatus (LFA), and results were discussed by including several
phenomena contributing to the thermal transmission in nc-pyrochlore in support
of the scattering mechanism. A systematic decrease in thermal conductivity with
reducing grain size can be understood by the phonon-pore scattering phenomenon.
Furthermore, dominate of the boundary scattering on the thermal transmission
with the increasing temperature is also observed. The experimentally determined
values of thermal conductivity are compatible with the thermal insulation
requirements for thermal barrier coating (TBC) applications

<h3>Unexpected bending behavior of 2D lattice materials</h3>

Architected 2D lattice materials are appealing for shape-shifting
applications due to the tunable sign of Poisson's ratio. It is commonly
believed that the positive and negative Poisson's ratios lead to anticlastic
and synclastic curvatures respectively when the material is bent in one
direction. Here, taking 2D beam lattices with star-shaped unit cells as
examples, we show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that this is not
always true. At a fixed Poisson's ratio, we find a transition between
anticlastic and synclastic bending curvatures controlled by the beam's
cross-sectional aspect ratio. Such an unexpected behavior roots in the
competition between torsion and bending of the beams, and can be well captured
by a Cosserat continuum model.

Quasiperiodic systems show a universal gap structure due to quasiperiodicity
which is analogous to gap openings at the Brillouin zone boundary in periodic
systems. The integrated density of states (IDoS) below those energy gaps are
characterized by a few integers, which is known as the ``gap labeling theorem''
(GLT) for quasiperiodic systems. In this study, focusing on multilayer thin
film systems such as twisted bilayer graphene and stacked transition metal
dichalcogenides, we extend the GLT for multilayer systems of arbitrary
dimensions and number of layers, using an approach based on the algebra called
``a noncommutative torus''. We find that the energy gaps and the associated
IDoS are generally characterized by $_{DN}C_D$ integer labels in $N$ layer
systems in the $D$ dimensions, when the effect of the interlayer coupling can
be approximated by a quasiperiodic intralayer coupling for each layer. We
demonstrate that the generalized GLT holds for quasiperiodic 1D tight binding
models by numerical simulations.

<h3>Spectrum, Lifshitz transitions and orbital currents in frustrated  fermionic ladders with a uniform flux</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ultracold Fermi gases with synthetic gauge field represent an excellent
platform to study the combined effect of lattice frustration and an effective
magnetic flux close to one flux quantum per particle. The minimal theoretical
model to accomplish this task is a system of spinless noninteracting fermions
on a triangular two-chain flux ladder. In this paper we consider this model
close to half-filling, with interchain hopping amplitudes alternating along the
zigzag bonds of the ladder and being small. In such setting qualitative changes
in the ground state properties of the model, most notably the flux-induced
topological Lifshitz transitions are shifted towards the values of the flux per
a diatomic plaquette ($f$) close to the flux quantum ($f\sim 1/2$). Geometrical
frustration of the lattice breaks the $k \to \pi - k$ particle-hole spectral
symmetry present in non-frustrated ladders, and leads to splitting of the
degeneracies at metal-insulator transitions. A remarkable feature of a
translationally invariant triangular ladder is the appearance of isolated Dirac
node at the Brillouin zone boundary, rendering the ground state at $f=1/2$
semi-metallic. We calculate the flux dependence of the orbital current and
identify Lifshitz critical points by the singularities in this dependence at a
constant chemical potential $\mu$ and constant particle density $\rho$. The
absence of the particle-hole symmetry in the triangular ladder leads to the
asymmetry between particle ($\rho>1$) and hole ($\rho<1$) doping and to
qualitatively different results for the phase diagram, Lifshitz points and the
flux dependence of the orbital current in the settings $\rho={\rm const}$ and
$\mu={\rm const}$.

Understanding the microscopic origin of the gate-controlled supercurrent
(GCS) in superconducting nanobridges is crucial for engineering superconducting
switches suitable for a variety of electronic applications. The origin of GCS
is controversial, and various mechanisms have been proposed to explain it. In
this work, we have investigated the GCS in a Ta layer deposited on the surface
of InAs nanowires. Comparison between switching current distributions at
opposite gate polarities and between the gate dependence of two opposite side
gates with different nanowire$-$gate spacings shows that the GCS is determined
by the power dissipated by the gate leakage. We also found a substantial
difference between the influence of the gate and elevated bath temperature on
the magnetic field dependence of the supercurrent. Detailed analysis of the
switching dynamics at high gate voltages shows that the device is driven into
the multiple phase slips regime by high-energy fluctuations arising from the
leakage current.

Understanding the creep mechanisms and deformation response at different
stresses and temperatures is crucial for design using nickel-base superalloys
for high-temperature applications. In this study, the creep behaviour of a
newly designed superalloy (nominated Alloy 11) at different stress and
temperature was systematically investigated using SEM, STEM, EBSD and
synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Material properties and mechanical response were
analysed by considering such properties as lattice parameters and misfit, phase
volume fraction, microstrain in reference and crept samples. Detwinning and
dynamic recrystallization were observed for the crept samples. STEM
characterization of deformed materials reveals that multiple deformation
mechanisms and defects could be identified in crept samples, namely,
dislocations in the gamma matrix channels and in gamma prime precipitates,
along with continuous and isolated stacking faults. The highest values of
lattice misfit, microstrain and lattice parameter change were observed at the
centre of dogbone-shaped crept samples. This was associated with the hump
shaped temperature distribution profile during creep testing. The significant
spatial variation detected in terms of lattice parameters, misfit and
microstrain supports the conclusion that it is important to perform spatially
resolved measurements instead of considering each sample as a single
measurement point when investigating creep response. It is also worth noting
that the statistics of the lattice-parameter distribution for the gamma and
gamma prime phases obey a gaussian distribution. In conclusion, a discussion is
given for the meaning and implications of these findings for future research.

<h3>Controlling magnetic anisotropy in amplitude expansion of phase field  crystal model</h3>

The amplitude expansion for a magnetic phase-field-crystal (magnetic APFC)
model enables a convenient coarse-grained description of crystalline structures
under the influence of magnetic fields. Considering higher-order magnetic
coupling terms, we demonstrate the possibility of tuning the magnetic
anisotropy in these models. This allows for reproducing the easy and hard
direction of magnetization. Such a result can be achieved without increasing
the computational cost, enabling simulations of the manipulation of dislocation
networks and microstructures in ferromagnetic materials. As a demonstration, we
report on the simulation of the shrinkage of a spherical grain with the
magnetic anisotropy of Fe.

Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) has been observed in a variety of
stacks with ferromagnetic/spin Hall material bilayer structures. In this work,
we reported UMR in antiferromagnetic insulator Fe2O3/Pt structure. The UMR has
a negative value, which is related to interfacial Rashba coupling and band
splitting. Thickness-dependent measurement reveals a potential competition
between UMR and the unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR). This
work revealed the existence of UMR in antiferromagnetic insulators/heavy metal
bilayers and broadens the way for the application of antiferromagnet-based
spintronic devices.

<h3>On the Effect of Nucleation Undercooling on Phase Transformation  Kinetics</h3>

<br>
<br>
We carry out an extensive comparison between Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov
(JMAK) theory of first-order phase transformation kinetics and phase-field (PF)
results of a benchmark problem on nucleation. To address the stochasticity of
the problem, several hundreds of simulations are performed to establish a
comprehensive, statistically-significant analysis of the coincidences and
discrepancies between PF and JMAK transformation kinetics. We find that PF
predictions are in excellent agreement with both classical nucleation theory
and JMAK theory, as long as the original assumptions of the latter are
appropriately reproduced - in particular, the constant nucleation and growth
rates in an infinite domain. When deviating from these assumptions, PF results
are at odds with JMAK theory. In particular, we observe that the size of the
initial particle radius $r_0$ relative to the critical nucleation radius $r^*$
has a significant effect on the rate of transformation. While PF and JMAK agree
when $r_0$ is sufficiently higher than $r^*$, the duration of initial transient
growth stage of a particle, before it reaches a steady growth velocity,
increases as $r_0/r^*\to 1$. This incubation time has a significant effect on
the overall kinetics, e.g. on the Avrami exponent of the multi-particle
simulations. In contrast, for the considered conditions and parameters, the
effect of interface curvature upon transformation kinetics - in particular
negative curvature regions appearing during particle impingement, present in PF
but absent in JMAK theory - appears to be minor compared to that of $r_0/r^*$.
We argue that rigorous benchmarking of phase-field models of stochastic
processes (e.g. nucleation) need sufficient statistical data in order to make
rigorous comparisons against ground truth theories. In these problems, analysis
of probability distributions is clearly preferable to a deterministic approach.

We consider a quantum Hall (QH) region in contact with a superconductor (SC),
i.e., a QH-SC junction. Due to successive Andreev reflections, the QH-SC
interface hosts hybridized electron and hole edge states called chiral Andreev
edge states (CAES). We theoretically study the transport properties of these
CAES by using a microscopic, tight-binding model. We find that the transport
properties strongly depend on the contact geometry and the value of the filling
factor. We notice that it is necessary to add local barriers at the corners of
the junction in order to reproduce such properties, when using effective
one-dimensional models.

Finding guiding principles to optimize properties of quantum anomalous Hall
(QAH) insulators is of pivotal importance to fundamental science and
applications. Here, we build a first-principles QAH material database of
chirality and band gap, explore microscopic mechanisms determining the QAH
material properties, and obtain a general physical picture that can
comprehensively understand the QAH data. Our results reveal that the usually
neglected Coulomb exchange is unexpectedly strong in a large class of QAH
materials, which is the key to resolve experimental puzzles. Moreover, we
identify simple indicators for property evaluation and suggest material design
strategies to control QAH chirality and gap by tuning cooperative or competing
contributions via magnetic co-doping, heterostructuring, spin-orbit proximity,
etc. The work is valuable to future research of magnetic topological physics
and materials.

<h3>Grain growth competition during melt pool solidification -- Comparing  phase-field and cellular automaton models</h3>

<br>
<br>
A broad range of computational models have been proposed to predict
microstructure development during solidification processing but they have
seldom been compared to each other on a quantitative and systematic basis. In
this paper, we compare phase-field (PF) and cellular automaton (CA) simulations
of polycrystalline growth in a two-dimensional melt pool under conditions
relevant to additive manufacturing (powder-bed fusion). We compare the
resulting grain structures using local (point-by-point) measurements, as well
as averaged grain orientation distributions over several simulations. We
explore the effect of the CA spatial discretization level and that of the melt
pool aspect ratio upon the selected grain texture. Our simulations show that
detailed microscopic features related to transient growth conditions and
solid-liquid interface stability (e.g. the initial planar growth stage prior to
its cellular/dendritic destabilization, or the early elimination of unfavorably
oriented grains due to neighbor grain sidebranching) can only be captured by PF
simulations. The resulting disagreement between PF and CA predictions can only
be addressed partially by a refinement of the CA grid. However, overall grain
distributions averaged over the entire melt pools of several simulations seem
to lead to a notably better agreement between PF and CA, with some variability
with the melt pool shape and CA grid. While further research remains required,
in particular to identify the appropriate selection of CA spatial
discretization and its link to characteristic microstructural length scales,
this research provides a useful step forward in this direction by comparing
both methods quantitatively at process-relevant length and time scales.

<br>
<br>
Linear nonsaturating magnetoresistance (LMR) represents a class of anomalous
resistivity response to external magnetic field that has been observed in a
variety of materials including but not limited to topological semi-metals,
high-Tc superconductors and materials with charge/spin density wave (CDW/SDW)
orders. Here we report the observation of LMR in layered kagome superconductor
and CDW material CsV3Sb5 thin flakes, as well as the dimensional crossover and
temperature (T) crossover of such LMR. Specifically, in ultrathin CsV3Sb5
crystals, the magnetoresistance (MR) exhibits a crossover from LMR at low T to
quadratic B dependence above the CDW transition temperature; the MR also
exhibits a crossover from LMR to sublinear MR for sample thickness at around
~20 nm at low T. We discuss several possible origins of the LMR and attribute
the effect to two-dimensional (2D) CDW fluctuations. Our results may provide a
new perspective for understanding the interactions between competing orders in
kagome superconductors.

The correct accounting for thermal effects is always a challenge when one
needs to make quantitative predictions for any laser applications. In such
complicated devices as quantum cascade lasers temperature strongly affects the
operational conditions preventing reaching the CW mode as well as effective
device performance in pulsed regime. Rate equations are the most effective and
simple way to model lasing dynamics. However the conventional approaches
operate under the mean-field approximation, considering finite number of
population levels and generalizing the obtained results to the infinite number
of cascades. The last may lead to unavoidable non-physical results and
difficulties in making quantitative predictions. In this work we modify the
conventional three-level rate equation approach by adding self-heating
description and applying it to the calculation of QCL dynamics. As a result we
disclose the importance of temperature affecting the threshold characteristics
and build-up time and include electronic aspects to the description of QCL.

We consider Majorana zero modes in a Josephson junction on top of a
topological insulator in transverse magnetic field. Majorana zero modes reside
at periodically located nodes of Josephson vortices. We find that hybridization
of these modes is prohibited by symmetries of the problem at vanishing chemical
potential, which ensures better protection of zero modes and yields methods to
control the tunnel coupling between Majorana modes for quantum information
processing applications.

The transport of biomolecules across a cell membrane is an important
phenomena that plays a pivotal role in the functioning of biological cells. In
this paper, we investigate such processes by modeling the translocation of
polymers through a conical channel, directed from the wider opening to the
narrow end of the conical channel. We use the molecular dynamics approach to
study the problem. The effect of the different conical pore geometry and
polymer lengths on translocation dynamics is determined from the behavior of
the total translocation time, $\tau$, and waiting time distributions, $w(s)$.
The escape of polymer segments from the narrow end of the conical channel is
tracked by studying their velocity profile ($v_{s}$). To demonstrate the
asymmetric pore effects on the translocation dynamics, we compare the
translocation process from both the ends of the conical channel. We find
striking differences in the translocation dynamics for both processes, which
are in agreement with the experimental study. We have accounted the effect of
various rigidity, and increasing length of a polymer chain, on both types of
processes. The study can be used to find the transition from a directional
dependent to a directional independent translocation process through a
asymmetric channel.

<h3>Comparison of two artificial neural networks trained for the surrogate  modeling of stress in materially heterogeneous elastoplastic solids</h3>

<br>
<br>
The purpose of this work is the systematic comparison of the application of
two artificial neural networks (ANNs) to the surrogate modeling of the stress
field in materially heterogeneous periodic polycrystalline microstructures. The
first ANN is a UNet-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for periodic data,
and the second is based on Fourier neural operators (FNO). Both of these were
trained, validated, and tested with results from the numerical solution of the
boundary-value problem (BVP) for quasi-static mechanical equilibrium in
periodic grain microstructures with square domains. More specifically, these
ANNs were trained to correlate the spatial distribution of material properties
with the equilibrium stress field under uniaxial tensile loading. The resulting
trained ANNs (tANNs) calculate the stress field for a given microstructure on
the order of 1000 (UNet) to 2500 (FNO) times faster than the numerical solution
of the corresponding BVP.
For microstructures in the test dataset, the FNO-based tANN, or simply FNO,
is more accurate than its UNet-based counterpart; the normalized mean absolute
error of different stress components for the former is 0.25-0.40% as compared
to 1.41-2.15% for the latter. Errors in FNO are restricted to grain boundary
regions, whereas the error in U-Net also comes from within the grain. In
comparison to U-Net, errors in FNO are more robust to large variations in
spatial resolution as well as small variations in grain density. On other hand,
errors in U-Net are robust to variations in boundary box aspect ratio, whereas
errors in FNO increase as the domain becomes rectangular. Both tANNs are
however unable to reproduce strong stress gradients, especially around regions
of stress concentration.

Strong `spin'-orbit coupled one-dimensional hole gas is achievable in an
unstrained Ge nanowire in the presence of a strong magnetic field. Basing on
the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the spherical approximation, we show this
strong `spin'-orbit coupled one-dimensional hole gas can be accurately
described by an effective two-band Hamiltonian $H^{\rm
ef}=\hbar^{2}k^{2}_{z}/(2m^{*}_{h})+\alpha\sigma^{z}k_{z}+g^{*}_{h}\mu_{B}B\sigma^{x}/2$,
as long as the magnetic field is purely longitudinal or purely transverse. The
explicit magnetic field dependent expressions of the `spin'-orbit coupling
$\alpha\equiv\alpha(B)$ and the effective $g$-factor
$g^{*}_{h}\equiv\,g^{*}_{h}(B)$ are given. When the magnetic field is applied
in an arbitrary direction, the two-band Hamiltonian description is still a good
approximation.

High-pressure structural searches of superhydrides CeBeH$_8$ and CeBH$_8$
were performed under ambient pressure up to 300 GPa. We identify
$Fm\overline{3}m$-CeBeH$_8$ with a superconducting transition temperature
$T_{c}$ of 56 K at 10 GPa. Two more phases with spacegroup $R\overline{3}m$ and
$C2/m$, were investigated within the increasing pressures. CeBH$_8$ shows a
similar phase transition process as CeBeH$_8$ but with higher transition
pressures and higher $T_c$. $Fm\overline{3}m$-CeBH$_8$ is predicted to be
superconducting above 120 GPa with a maximum $T_{c}$ of 118 K at 150 GPa.
$R\overline{3}m$-CeBH$_8$ and $C2/m$-CeBH$_8$ are dynamically stable above 120
GPa and 100 GPa, respectively. The maximum $T_{c}$ is 123 K at 195 GPa for
$R\overline{3}m$-CeBH$_8$, and 115 K at 350 GPa for $C2/m$-CeBH$_8$. Our work

The infinite-layer nickelates, isostructural to the high-Tc superconductor
cuprates, have risen as a promising platform to host unconventional
superconductivity and stimulated growing interests in the condensed matter
community. Despite numerous researches, the superconducting pairing symmetry of
the nickelate superconductors, the fundamental characteristic of a
superconducting state, is still under debate. Moreover, the strong electronic
correlation in the nickelates may give rise to a rich phase diagram, where the
underlying interplay between the superconductivity and other emerging quantum
states with broken symmetry is awaiting exploration. Here, we study the angular
dependence of the transport properties on the infinite-layer nickelate
Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 superconducting films with Corbino-disk configuration. The
azimuthal angular dependence of the magnetoresistance (R({\phi})) manifests the
rotational symmetry breaking from isotropy to four-fold (C4) anisotropy with
increasing magnetic field, revealing a symmetry breaking phase transition.
Approaching the low temperature and large magnetic field regime, an additional
two-fold (C2) symmetric component in the R({\phi}) curves and an anomalous
upturn of the temperature-dependent critical field are observed simultaneously,
suggesting the emergence of an exotic electronic phase. Our work uncovers the
evolution of the quantum states with different rotational symmetries and
provides deep insight into the global phase diagram of the nickelate
superconductors.

Defective spectral degeneracy, known as exceptional point (EP), lies at the
heart of various intriguing phenomena in optics, acoustics, and other
non-conservative systems. Despite extensive studies in the past two decades,
the \textit{collective} behaviors (e.g., annihilation, coalescence, braiding,
etc.) involving multiple exceptional points or lines and their interplay have
been rarely understood. Here we put forward a universal non-Abelian
conservation rule governing these collective behaviors in generic multiband
non-Hermitian systems and uncover several counter-intuitive phenomena. We
demonstrate that two EPs with opposite charges (even the pairwise created) do
not necessarily annihilate, depending on how they approach each other.
Furthermore, we unveil that the conservation rule imposes strict constraints on
the permissible exceptional-line configurations. It excludes structures like
Hopf link yet permits novel staggered rings composed of non-commutative
exceptional lines. These intriguing phenomena are illustrated by concrete
models which could be readily implemented in platforms like coupled acoustic
cavities, optical waveguides, and ring resonators. Our findings lay the
cornerstone for a comprehensive understanding of the exceptional non-Abelian

Gauge theory and thermalization are both foundations of physics and nowadays
are both topics of essential importance for modern quantum science and
technology. Simulating lattice gauge theories (LGTs) realized recently with
ultracold atoms provides a unique opportunity for carrying out a correlated
study of gauge theory and thermalization in the same setting. Theoretical
studies have shown that an Ising quantum phase transition exists in this
implemented LGT, and quantum thermalization can also signal this phase
transition. Nevertheless, it remains an experimental challenge to accurately
determine the critical point and controllably explore the thermalization
dynamics in the quantum critical regime due to the lack of techniques for
locally manipulating and detecting matter and gauge fields. Here, we report an
experimental investigation of the quantum criticality in the LGT from both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermalization perspectives by equipping the
single-site addressing and atom-number-resolved detection into our LGT
simulator. We accurately determine the quantum critical point agreed with the
predicted value. We prepare a $|Z_{2}\rangle$ state deterministically and study
its thermalization dynamics across the critical point, leading to the
observation that this $|Z_{2}\rangle$ state thermalizes only in the critical
regime. This result manifests the interplay between quantum many-body scars,
quantum criticality, and symmetry breaking.

The antiferromagnetism (AFM) and chiral-d wave superconductivity (SC) in a
honeycomb lattice close to an antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott state at half band
filling are studied with a t-J model and slave boson mean field theory. The
order parameters and single particle dispersion relations at different band
filling fractions are investigated. It is found that the AFM enhances the SC,
and leads to nodal single particle dispersion relations at two band filling
fractions. These unexpected nodal dispersion relations out of nodeless chiral-d
wave superconducting order are discussed. A comparison between AF chiral-d wave
states and AF extended-s wave states is also given to highlight the pertinent
features in chiral-d wave superconducting states. This study may be related to
the honeycomb lattice materials such as the In$_3$Cu$_2$VO$_9$ compound.

<br>
<br>
Spintronics in halide perovskites has drawn significant attention in recent
years, due to highly tunable spin-orbit fields and intriguing interplay with
lattice symmetry. Spin lifetime - a key parameter that determines the
applicability of materials for spintronics and spin-based quantum information
applications - has been extensively measured in halide perovskites, but not yet
assessed from first-principles calculations. Here, we leverage our
recently-developed ab initio density-matrix dynamics framework to compute the
spin relaxation time (T1) and ensemble spin dephasing time (T2*) in a prototype
halide perovskite, namely CsPbBr3 with self-consistent spin-orbit coupling and
quantum descriptions of the electron scattering processes. We also implement
the Land'e g-factor for solids from first principles and take it into account
in our dynamics, which is required to accurately capture spin dephasing under
external magnetic fields. We thereby predict intrinsic spin lifetimes as an
upper bound for experiments, identify the dominant spin relaxation pathways,
and evaluate the dependence on temperature, external fields, carrier density,
and impurities. Importantly, we find that the Frohlich interaction that
dominates carrier relaxation contributes negligibly to spin relaxation,
consistent with the spin-conserving nature of this interaction. Our theoretical
approach may lead to new strategies to optimize spin and carrier transport
properties in spintronics and quantum information applications.

<h3>Termination of Graphene Edges Created by Hydrogen and Deuterium Plasmas</h3>

<br>
<br>
Edge engineering is important for both fundamental research and applications
as the device size decreases to nanometer scale. This is especially the case
for graphene because a graphene edge shows totally different electronic
properties depending on the atomic structure and the termination. It has
recently been shown that an atomically precise zigzag edge can be obtained by
etching graphene and graphite using hydrogen (H) plasma. However, edge
termination had not been studied directly. In this study, termination of edges
created by H-plasma is studied by high-resolution electron energy loss
spectroscopy (HREELS) to show that the edge is $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$ bonded and the
edge carbon atom is terminated by only one H atom. This suggests that an ideal
zigzag edge, which is not only atomically precise but also $\mathrm{sp}^{2}$
bonding, can be obtained by H-plasma etching. Etching of the graphite surface
with plasma of a different isotope, deuterium (D), is also studied by scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) to show that D-plasma anisotropically etches
graphite less efficiently, although it can make defects more efficiently, than
H-plasma.

<h3>Oscillatory Exchange Bias Controlled by RKKY in Magnetic Multilayers</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayers are interfaced with normal
metal/ferromagnetic bilayers to form F*/AF/N/F valves. The N-spacer thickness
is chosen such that it mediates strong indirect exchange (RKKY) between the
outer magnetic layers, which varies in strength/direction depending on the N
thickness and in direction on switching F. The system exhibits a strong
modulation of the F*/AF exchange bias, oscillating in strength syncronously
with the oscillation in the interlayer RKKY exchange across the normal metal
spacer. The effect is explained as due to a superposition taking place within
the antiferromagnetic layer of the direct-exchange proximity effect from the
F*/AF interface and the indirect RKKY exchange from F penetrating AF via N. The
modulation, expressed via the strength of the F*/AF bias field, reaches 400\%
at the first RKKY peak.

<h3>Distinct moir√© textures of in-plane electric polarizations for  distinguishing moir√© origins in binary compound bilayers</h3>

<br>
<i>Hongyi Yu, Ziheng Zhou, Wang Yao</i>
<br>
<br>
In binary compound 2D insulators/semiconductors such as hexagonal boron
nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides, the different electron affinities
of atoms can give rise to out-of-plane electrical polarizations across
inversion asymmetric van der Waals interface of near 0 degree twisting angles.
Here we show that at a general stacking order where sliding breaks the in-plane
C3 rotation, the out-of-plane charge transfer also leads to an in-plane
electrical polarization, with a comparable magnitude to that of the
out-of-plane ones. The effect is demonstrated using a hexagonal boron nitride
bilayer of the R-type stacking. In long wavelength moir\'e patterns, the
in-plane electrical polarizations determined by the local interlayer stacking
registries constitute topologically nontrivial spatial textures. We show that
these textures can distinguish moir\'e patterns of different origins from
twisting, biaxial and uniaxial heterostrain, where vector fields of the
electrical dipoles have distinct winding numbers, curl and divergence.

<br>
<br>
Quasiparticle self-consistent many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) methods
that update both eigenvalues and eigenvectors can calculate the excited-state
properties of molecular systems without depending on the choice of starting
points. However, those methods are computationally intensive even on modern
multi-core central processing units (CPUs) and thus typically limited to small
systems. Many-core accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) may be
able to boost the performance of those methods without losing accuracy, making
starting-point-independent MBPT methods applicable to large systems. Here, we
GPU accelerate MOLGW, a Gaussian-based MBPT code for molecules, with open
accelerators (OpenACC) and achieve speedups of up to 10x over 16 open
multi-processing (OpenMP) CPU threads on a personal computer.

<h3>Quantum criticality in the disordered Aubry-Andr√© model</h3>

<br>
<i>Xuan Bu1, Liang-Jun Zhai, Shuai Yin</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we explore quantum criticality in the disordered
Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) model. For the pure AA model, it is well-known that it
hosts a critical point separating an extended phase and a localized insulator
phase by tuning the strength of the quasiperiodic potential. Here we unearth
that the disorder strength $\Delta$ contributes an independent relevant
direction near the critical point of the AA model. Our scaling analyses show
that the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\Delta$ as
$\xi\propto\Delta^{-\nu_\Delta}$ with $\nu_\Delta$ a new critical exponent,
which is estimated to be $\nu_\Delta\approx0.46$. This value is remarkably
different from the counterparts for both the pure AA model and the Anderson
model. Moreover, rich critical phenomena are discovered in the critical region
spanned by the quasiperiodic and the disordered potentials. In particular, in
the extended phase side, we show that the scaling theory satisfy a hybrid
scaling form as a result of the overlap between the critical regions of the AA
model and the Anderson localization.

<h3>Nonlinear spin current of photoexcited magnons in collinear  antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the nonlinear magnon spin current induced by an ac electric field
under light irradiation in collinear antiferromagnets with broken inversion
symmetry. For linearly polarized light, we find that a dc spin current appears
through ``the magnon spin shift current" mechanism, which is driven by a spin
polarization generation in the two magnon creation process and has a close
relationship to the geometry of magnon bands through Berry connection. For
circularly polarized light, a dc spin current appears through ``the spin
injection current" mechanism, which is proportional to the relaxation time of
magnons and can be large when the magnon lifetime is long. We demonstrate
generation of the magnon spin shift and injection currents, based on a few toy
models and a realistic model for a multiferroic material M$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$.

<br>
<br>
Adopting a spintronics-inspired approach, we study the reciprocal coupling
between ionic charge currents and nematic texture dynamics in a uniaxial
nematic electrolyte. Assuming quenched fluid dynamics, we develop equations of
motion analogously to spin torque and spin pumping. Based on the principle of
least dissipation of energy, we derive the adiabatic "nematic torque" exerted
by ionic currents on the nematic director field as well as the reciprocal
motive force on ions due to the orientational dynamics of the director. We
discuss several simple examples that illustrate the potential functionality of
this coupling, as well as propose how one could measure the coupling strength.
Exploring further applications based on this physics could foster the
development of nematronics -- nematic iontronics.

<h3>Beyond quantum chaos in emergent dual holography</h3>

Black hole is well known to be a fast scrambler, responsible for physics of
quantum chaos in dual holography. Recently, the Euclidean worm hole has been
proposed to play a central role in the chaotic behavior of the spectral form
factor. Furthermore, this phenomena was reinterpreted based on an effective
field theory approach for quantum chaos. Since the graded nonlinear
$\sigma-$model approach can describe not only the Wigner-Dyson level statistics
but also its Poisson distribution, it is natural to ask whether the dual
holography can touch the Poisson regime beyond the quantum chaos. In this
study, we investigate disordered strongly coupled conformal field theories in
the large central-charge limit. An idea is to consider a quenched average for
metric fluctuations and to take into account the renormalization group flow of
the metric-tensor distribution function from the UV to the IR boundary. Here,
renormalization effects at a given disorder configuration are described by the
conventional dual holography. We uncover that the renormalized distribution
function shows a power-law behavior universally, interpreted as an infinite
randomness fixed point.

<h3>Disorder effects in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model</h3>

<br>
<br>
We study the interplay of disorder and Heisenberg interactions in Kitaev
model on honeycomb lattice. The effect of disorder on the transition between
Kitaev spin liquid and magnetic ordered states as well as the stability of
magnetic ordering is investigated. Using Lanczos exact diagonalization we
discuss the consequences of two types of disorder: (i) random-coupling disorder
and (ii) singular-coupling disorder. They exhibit qualitatively similar effects
in the pure Kitaev-Heisenberg model without long-range interactions. The range
of spin liquid phases is reduced and the transition to magnetic ordered phases
becomes more crossover-like. Furthermore, the long-range zigzag and stripy
orderings in the clean system are replaced by their three domains with
different ordering direction. Especially in the crossover range the coexistence
of magnetically ordered and Kitaev spin-liquid domains is possible. With
increasing the disorder strength the area of domains becomes smaller and the
system goes into a spin-glass state. However, the disorder effect is different
in magnetically ordered phases caused by long-range interactions. The stability
of such magnetic ordering is diminished by singular-coupling disorder, and
accordingly, the range of spin-liquid regime is extended. This mechanism may be
relevant to materials like $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and H$_3$LiIr$_2$O$_6$ where the
zigzag ground state is stabilized by weak long-range interactions. We also find
that the flux gap closes at a critical disorder strength and vortices appears
in the flux arrangement. Interestingly, the vortices tend to form kinds of
commensurate ordering.

<br>
<br>
We report on the single-molecule electronic and thermoelectric properties of
strategically chosen anthracene-based molecules with anchor groups capable of
binding to noble metal substrates, such as gold and platinum. Specifically, we
study the effect of different anchor groups, as well as quantum interference,
on the electric conductance and the thermopower of gold/single-molecule/gold
junctions and generally find good agreement between theory and experiment. All
molecular junctions display transport characteristics consistent with coherent
transport and a Fermi alignment approximately in the middle of the HOMO/LUMO
gap. Single-molecule results are in agreement with previously reported
thin-film data, further supporting the notion that molecular design
considerations may be translated from the single- to the many-molecule devices.
For combinations of anchor groups where one binds significantly more strongly
to the electrodes than the other, the stronger anchor group appears to dominate
the thermoelectric behaviour of the molecular junction. For other combinations,
the choice of electrode material can determine the sign and magnitude of the
thermopower. This finding has important implications for the design of
thermoelectric generator devices, where both n- and p-type conductor are
required for thermoelectric current generation.

We develop a software package SPADExp (simulator of photoemission angular
distribution for experiments) to calculate the photoemission angular
distribution (PAD), which is the momentum dependence of spectrum intensity in
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The software can directly
load the output of the first-principles software package OpenMX, so users do
not need to construct tight-binding models as previous studies did for PAD
calculations. As a result, we can calculate the PADs of large systems such as
quasicrystals and slab systems. We calculate the PADs of sublattice systems
(graphene and graphite) to reproduce characteristic intensity distributions,
which ARPES has experimentally observed. After that, we investigate twisted
bilayer graphene, a quasicrystal showing 12-fold rotational symmetric spectra
in ARPES, and the surface states of the topological insulator
$\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Se}_3$. Our calculations show good agreement with
previous ARPES measurements, showing the correctness of our calculation
software and further potential to investigate the photoemission spectra of
novel quantum materials.

The mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials are important for
a wide range of applications including composite materials, van der Waals
materials and flexible electronics. Several aspects are highly debated in the
literature: For example, the theoretically predicted bending rigidity, $\kappa
(T)$, of the most important 2D material, graphene, varies from 0.8~eV to 10~eV
for predictions at 0 K and there are predictions that it could increase or
decrease with temperature depending on the applied theory. Here we present the
first systematic experimental study of the temperature dependence $\kappa(T)$
of graphene. Extracting values of $\kappa$ from the ZA-phonon dispersion
relation measured with helium atom scattering, we find the value of $\kappa(T)$
to increase with sample temperature. A linear fit in the temperature range (120
K-480 K) gives a bending rigidity of $\kappa (T) = (1.1 \pm 0.1)[\textrm{eV}] +
(0.0013 \pm 0.0001)[\textrm{eV/K}] \times T$.

We develop a biased Monte Carlo algorithm to measure probabilities of rare
events in cluster-cluster aggregation for arbitrary collision kernels. Given a
trajectory with a fixed number of collisions, the algorithm modifies both the
waiting times between collisions, as well as the sequence of collisions, using
local moves. We show that the algorithm is ergodic by giving a protocol that
transforms an arbitrary trajectory to a standard trajectory using valid Monte
Carlo moves. The algorithm can sample rare events with probabilities of the
order of $10^{-40}$ and lower. The algorithm's effectiveness in sampling
low-probability events is established by showing that the numerical results for
the large deviation function of constant-kernel aggregation reproduce the exact
results. It is shown that the algorithm can obtain the large deviation
functions for other kernels, including gelling ones, as well as the instanton
trajectories for atypical times. The dependence of the autocorrelation times,
both temporal and configurational, on the different parameters of the algorithm
is also characterized.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered dielectrics offers a compelling route towards
the design of next-generation ultimately compact nanoelectronics. Motivated by
recent high-throughput computational prediction of LaO$X$ ($X$ = Br, Cl) as an
exceptional 2D dielectrics that significantly outperforms HfO$_2$ even in the
monolyaer limit, we investigate the interface properties between LaOX and the
archetypal 2D semiconductors of monolayer transition metal dichacolgenides
(TMDCs) $M$S$_2$ ($M$ = Mo, W) using first-principle density functional theory
simulations. We show that LaO$X$ monolayers interacts weakly with $M$S$_2$ via
van der Waals forces with negligible hybridization and interfacial charge
transfer, thus conveniently preserving the electronic properties of 2D TMDCs
upon contact formation. The conduction and valance band offsets of the
interfaces exhibit a sizable value ranging from 0.7 to 1.4 eV, suggesting the
capability of LaO$X$ as a gate dielectric materials. Based on Murphy-Good
electron emission model, we demonstrate that LaOCl/MoS$_2$ is a versatile
dielectric/semiconductor combinations that are compatible to both NMOS and PMOS
applications with leakage current lower than $10^{-7}$ Acm$^{-2}$, while
LaO$X$/WS$_2$ is generally compatible with PMOS application. The presence of an
interfacial tunneling potential barrier at the van der Waals gap further
provide an additional mechanism to suppress the leakage current. Our findings
reveal the role LaO$X$ as an excellent dielectric companion to 2D TMDC and
shall provide useful insights for leveraging the dielectric strength of LaO$X$
in the design of high-performance 2D nanodevices.

The spontaneous polarization of wurtzite III-V nitrides XN (X=Al, Ga, In) and
II-VI oxides YO (Y=Be, Zn) is investigated via first-principles computational
methods. The modern treatment defines this quantity as the polarization
difference between the investigated system and an appropriate reference state.
We demonstrate that the trigonal structure can be used as a reference to
determine the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite materials. We compare the
current values with the widely-known zincblende results reported in the
literature and find a very good agreement. It is shown that the electronic
contribution of polarization is greater than the ionic one. Furthermore, we
reproduce the experimental value of the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite
GaN reported in a previous study. In order to do so, we calculate the
spontaneous polarization for each type of stacking faults using periodic
supercells and the Berry-phase method. This theoretical analysis leads to a
value nearly identical to the experimental measurement.

a function of temperature and magnetic field, we show that the second critical
current stems from the intrinsic superconductivity of the S/TI interface, which
is supported by the modified Resistively Shunted Junction model and
Transmission Electron Microscopy studies. This complex structure of the

Liquid crystal elastomers are rubber-like solids with liquid crystalline
mesogens (stiff, rod-like molecules) incorporated either into the main chain or
as a side chain of the polymer. These solids display a range of unusual
thermo-mechanical properties as a result of the coupling between the entropic
elasticity of rubber and the orientational phase transitions of liquid
crystals. One of these intriguing properties is the soft behavior, where it is
able to undergo significant deformations with almost no stress. While the
phenomenon is well-known, it has largely been examined in the context of
homogenous deformations. This paper investigates soft behavior in complex
inhomogeneous deformations. We model these materials as hyperelastic,
isotropic, incompressible solids and exploit the seminal work of Ericksen, who
established the existence of non-trivial universal deformations, those that
satisfy the equations of equilibrium in every hyperelastic, isotropic,
incompressible solid. We study the inflation of spherical and cylindrical
balloons, cavitation and bending.

SiAlON is a prominent example of systems suitable as hosts for creating
materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In this work, the electronic
structure of a series of semiordered and disordered SiAlON systems is
investigated by means of ab initio calculations, using the FLAPW and Green
function KKR methods. Finite temperature effects are included by averaging over
thermodynamic configurations within the alloy analogy model. We found that the
dependence of the electronic structure on the (Al,O) concentration $z$ is
similar for semiordered and disordered structures. The electronic band gap
decreases with increasing $z$ by about 1.5 eV when going from $z$=0 to $z$=2.
States at the top of the valence band are mostly associated with N atoms
whereas the states at the bottom of the conduction band are mostly derived from
O~atoms. Increasing the temperature leads to a shift of the bottom of the
conduction band to lower energies. The amount of this shift increases with
increasing $z$.

A new DFT+U type corrective functional is derived from first principles to
enforce the flat plane condition on localized subspaces, thus dispensing with
the need for an ad hoc derivation from the Hubbard model. The newly derived
functional as given by equation 5 yields relative errors below 0.6% in the
total energy of the dissociated s-block dimers as well as the dissociated H5+
ring system. In comparison bare PBE and PBE+U (using Dudarev's 1998 Hubbard
functional) yields relative energetic errors as high as 8.0% and 20.5%
respectively.

We introduce a spin-symmetry-broken extension of the connected determinant
algorithm [Phys.Rev. Lett. 119, 045701 (2017)]. The resulting systematic
perturbative expansions around an antiferromagnetic state allow for numerically
exact calculations directly inside a magnetically ordered phase. We show new
precise results for the magnetic phase diagram and thermodynamics of the
three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model at half-filling. With detailed
computations of the order parameter in the low to intermediate-coupling regime,
we establish the N\'eel phase boundary. The critical behavior in its vicinity
is shown to be compatible with the $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. By
determining the evolution of the entropy with decreasing temperature through
the phase transition we identify the different physical regimes at $U/t\!=\!4$.
We provide quantitative results for several thermodynamic quantities deep
inside the antiferromagnetic dome up to large interaction strengths and
investigate the crossover between the Slater and Heisenberg regimes.

<h3>EC-MOF/Phase-I: A computationally ready database of electrically  conductive metal-organic frameworks with high-throughput structural and  electronic properties</h3>

The advent of pi-stacked layered metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) opened up
new horizons for designing compact MOF-based devices as they offer unique
electrical conductivity on top of permanent porosity and exceptionally high
surface area. By taking advantage of the modular nature of these electrically
conductive (EC) MOFs, an unlimited number of materials can be created for
applications in electronic devices such as battery electrodes, supercapacitors,
and spintronics. Permutation of structural building blocks including different
metal nodes and organic linkers results in new systems with unprecedented and
unexplored physical and chemical properties. With the ultimate goal of
providing a platform for accelerated materials design and discovery, here, we
lay the foundations towards creation of the first comprehensive database of
EC-MOFs with an experimentally guided approach. The first phase of this
database, coined EC-MOF/Phase-I, is comprised of 1,061 bulk and mono-layer
structures built by all possible combinations of experimentally reported
organic linkers, functional groups and metal nodes. A high-throughput screening
(HTS) work flow is constructed to implement density functional theory
calculations with periodic boundary conditions to optimize the structures and
calculate some of their most significantly relevant properties. Since research
and development in the area of EC-MOFs has long been suffering from the lack of
appropriate initial crystal structures, all the geometries and property data
have been made available for the use of the community through the online
platform that is developed in the course of this work. This database provides
comprehensive physical and chemical data of EC-MOFs as well as convenience of
selecting appropriate materials for specific applications, thus, accelerating
design and discovery of EC-MOF-based compact devices.

<h3>Learning macroscopic internal variables and history dependence from  microscopic models</h3>

his paper concerns the study of history dependent phenomena in heterogeneous
materials in a two-scale setting where the material is specified at a fine
microscopic scale of heterogeneities that is much smaller than the coarse
macroscopic scale of application. We specifically study a polycrystalline
medium where each grain is governed by crystal plasticity while the solid is
subjected to macroscopic dynamic loads. The theory of homogenization allows us
to solve the macroscale problem directly with a constitutive relation that is
defined implicitly by the solution of the microscale problem. However, the
homogenization leads to a highly complex history dependence at the macroscale,
one that can be quite different from that at the microscale. In this paper, we
examine the use of machine-learning, and especially deep neural networks, to
harness data generated by repeatedly solving the finer scale model to: (i) gain
insights into the history dependence and the macroscopic internal variables
that govern the overall response; and (ii) to create a computationally
efficient surrogate of its solution operator, that can directly be used at the
coarser scale with no further modeling. We do so by introducing a recurrent
neural operator (RNO), and show that: (i) the architecture and the learned
hidden variables can provide insight into the physics of the macroscopic
problem; and (ii) that the RNO can provide multiscale, specifically FE2,
accuracy at a cost comparable to a conventional empirical constitutive
relation.

<h3>Refined magnetic structure of VI$_3$</h3>

The van der Waals ferromagnet (FM), VI$_3$, was studied by muon spin
relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) and first principle calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT). Temperature dependent zero field muon spin relaxation
($\mu^+$SR) measurements confirm the onset of long range FM order and the time
spectra exhibits clear muon spin precession frequencies for $T<T_{\rm
C}=50.03(1)$~K. The calculated internal magnetic fields at the predicted muon
sites, based on the established magnetic structure from neutron diffraction, is
inconsistent with the measured one. This inconsistency is because of strong
incoherent neutron scattering and absorption originating from the elements V
and I. Instead, a new and a more accurate magnetic structure is derived based
on a combined study using $\mu^+$SR and DFT. These results suggest strong
contritions from orbital angular momentum, providing experimental evidence for
the existence of unquenched orbital angular momentum of V$^{3+}$ in VI$_3$.
Finally, an unusual form of a short range ordering is present above $T_{\rm
C}$. Its temperature dependence is unlike previously reported cases in other
layered compounds and its microscopic origin is discussed.

We report ultrafast x-ray scattering experiments of the quasi-1D charge
density wave (CDW) material (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I following photoexcitation with
femtosecond infrared laser pulses, carried out at the LCLS and SACLA hard x-ray
free-electron laser facilities. Time-resolved diffraction signals were obtained
at the first- and second-order CDW sidebands surrounding the (2 2 4) and (4 2
0) crystal Bragg peaks. Two modes with sub-THz frequencies are observed at the
CDW sidebands, one of which we identify as the amplitude mode of the CDW at a
frequency 0.11 THz based on the polarization dependence of the atomic
displacements relative to the static CDW distortion. The dynamics of this
acoustic amplitude mode are described well by a model of a displacive
excitation. We explain the displacive excitation of an acoustic amplitude mode
as excited indirectly through its coupling to the optical phonon component
associated with the tetramerization of the tantalum chains. We observe
linearly-dispersive features at GHz frequencies in the vicinity of the CDW
sidebands, but also near Bragg peaks of the crystal. While these may be
signatures of acoustic waves, their speed of sound does not match the
high-symmetry phase acoustic velocities.

<h3>Strange Correlation Function for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological  Phases</h3>

We design a strange correlator for the recently discovered average
symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases in $1d$ and $2d$. The strange
correlator has long-range or power-law behavior if the density matrix $\rho$ is
in a nontrivial ASPT phase. In all the $2d$ cases considered here, we find
interesting connections between strange correlators and correlation functions
in $2d$ loop models, based on which we can extract exact scaling exponents of
the strange correlators.

Scattering processes in quantum materials emerge as resonances in electronic
transport, including confined modes, Andreev states, and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
states. However, in most instances, these resonances are driven by a single
scattering mechanism. Here we show the appearance of resonances due to the
combination of two simultaneous scattering mechanisms, one from
superconductivity and the other from graphene p-n junctions. These resonances
stem from Andreev reflection and Klein tunneling that occur at two different
interfaces of a hole-doped region of graphene formed at the boundary with
superconducting graphene due to proximity effects from
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_1$Cu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. The resonances persist with gating the
from p$^+$-p and p-n configurations. The suppression of the oscillation
amplitude above the bias energy comparable to the induced superconducting gap
indicates the contribution from Andreev reflection. Our experimental
measurements are supported by quantum transport calculations in such
interfaces, leading to analogous resonances. Our results put forward a hybrid
scattering mechanism in graphene/high-temperature superconductor
heterojunctions of potential impact for graphene-based Josephson junctions.

<h3>Detecting emergent continuous symmetries at quantum criticality</h3>

New or enlarged symmetries can emerge at the low-energy spectrum of a
Hamiltonian that does not possess the symmetries, if the symmetry breaking
terms in the Hamiltonian are irrelevant under the renormalization group flow.
In this letter, we propose a tensor network based algorithm to numerically find
lattice operator approximations of the emergent conserved charges in the ground
state of any quantum spin chains, without the necessity to have prior knowledge
about its low-energy effective field theory. The results obtained with our
method shed new light on the emergent conserved charges in the spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$
Heisenberg model and a one-dimensional version of deconfined quantum critical
points (DQCP). It can also be viewed as a way to obtain the local integrals of
motion of an integrable model and local parent Hamiltonians of gapless ground
states.
