<h3>Can deep sub-wavelength cavities induce Amperean superconductivity in a  2D material?</h3>

Amperean superconductivity is an exotic phenomenon stemming from attractive
effective electron-electron interactions (EEEIs) mediated by a transverse gauge
field. Originally introduced in the context of quantum spin liquids and high-Tc
superconductors, Amperean superconductivity has been recently proposed to occur
at temperatures on the order of 1-20 K in two-dimensional, parabolic-band,
electron gases embedded inside deep sub-wavelength optical cavities. In this
work, we first generalize the microscopic theory of cavity-induced Amperean
superconductivity to the case of graphene and then argue that this
superconducting state cannot be achieved in the deep sub-wavelength regime. In
the latter regime, indeed, a cavity induces only EEEIs between density
fluctuations rather than the current-current interactions which are responsible
for Amperean pairing.

<h3>Fluorite-related iridate Pr$_3$IrO$_7$: Crystal growth, structure,  magnetism, thermodynamic, and optical properties</h3>

Spin-orbit coupling in heavy 5$d$ metal oxides, in particular, iridates have
received tremendous interest in recent years due to the realization of exotic
electronic and magnetic phases. Here, we report the synthesis, structural,
magnetic, thermodynamic, and optical properties of the ternary iridate
Pr$_3$IrO$_7$. Single crystals of Pr$_3$IrO$_7$ have been grown by the KF flux
method. Structural analysis shows that Pr$_3$IrO$_7$ crystallizes in an
orthorhombic phase with $Cmcm$ symmetry. The electron energy loss spectroscopy
study indicates that Pr is in a 3+ valence state, which implies a 5+ oxidation
state of Ir. Magnetization data measured at high and low magnetic fields do not
exhibit any bifurcation between $M_{ZFC}$ and $M_{FC}$, however, a weak hump in
$M(T)$ is observed at $T^*$$\sim$10.4~K. The specific heat data reveal two
maxima at $\sim$253 K and $\sim$4.8 K. The optical conductivity
$\sigma_1(\omega)$ spectrum shows 24 infrared-active phonon modes and reveals
an insulating behavior with an optical gap $\Delta_{OP}$ of size $\sim$500~meV.
During cooling down, the temperature-dependent reflectivity spectrum reveals
eight extra phonon modes below the structural phase transition ($\sim$ 253 K).
An anomaly is observed at around $T^*$ in the temperature evolution of
infrared-active mode frequencies suggesting the presence of significant
spin-phonon coupling in the system.

<h3>Three length scales colloidal gels: the clusters of clusters versus the  interpenetrating clusters approach</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10505" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10505</a>

Typically, in quiescent conditions, attractive colloids at low volume
fractions form fractal gels structured into two length scales: the colloidal
and the fractal cluster scales. However when flow interfere with gelation
colloidal fractal gels may display three distinct length scales [Dag\`es, et
al., Soft Matter 18, 6645 (2022)]. Following those recent experimental
investigations, we derive two models that account for the structure and the
rheological properties of such atypical colloidal gels. The gel elasticity is
inferred from scaling arguments and the structure is translated into scattering
intensities following the global scattering functions approach proposed by
Beaucage and typically measured in small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). In both
models, we consider that the colloids condensate into fractal clusters. In the
clusters of clusters model, the clusters form superagregates which then build
the gel network. In the interpenetrating clusters model, the clusters
interpenetrate one-another to form the gel network. Those two models are then
utilised to analyse rheo-SAXS experiments carried out on carbon black gels
formed through flow cessation. The results of the analysis vouch for the
clusters of clusters model with a densification of the structures as the gel
characteristic length scales increase.

<h3>Equatorial Waves in Rotating Bubble-Trapped Superfluids</h3>

As the Earth rotates, the Coriolis force causes several oceanic and
atmospheric waves to be trapped along the equator, including Kelvin, Yanai,
Rossby, and Poincar\'e modes. It has been demonstrated that the mathematical
origin of these waves is related to the nontrivial topology of the underlying
hydrodynamic equations. Inspired by recent observations of Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC) in bubble-shaped traps in microgravity ultracold quantum gas
experiments, we show that equatorial modes are supported by a rapidly rotating
condensate in a spherical geometry. Based on a zero-temperature coarse-grained
hydrodynamic framework, we reformulate the coupled oscillations of the
superfluid and the Abrikosov vortex lattice resulting from rotation by a
Schr\"odinger-like eigenvalue problem. The obtained non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
is topologically nontrivial. Furthermore, we solve the hydrodynamic equations
for a spherical geometry and find that the rotating superfluid hosts Kelvin,
Yanai, and Poincar\'e equatorial modes, but not the Rossby mode. Our
predictions can be tested with state-of-the-art bubble-shaped trapped BEC
experiments.

<h3>Electronic and Excitonic Properties of MSi2Z4 Monolayers</h3>

MA2Z4 monolayers form a new class of hexagonal non-centrosymmetric materials
hosting extraordinary spin-valley physics. While only two compounds (MoSi2N4
and WSi2N4) were recently synthesized, theory predicts interesting
(opto)electronic properties of a whole new family of such two-dimensional
materials. Here, the chemical trends of band gaps and spin-orbit splittings of
bands in selected MSi2Z4 (M = Mo, W; Z = N, P, As, Sb) compounds are studied
from first-principles. Effective Bethe-Salpeter-equation-based calculations
reveal high exciton binding energies. Evolution of excitonic energies under
external magnetic field is predicted by providing their effective g-factors and
diamagnetic coefficients, which can be directly compared to experimental
values. In particular, large positive g-factors are predicted for excitons
involving higher conduction bands. In view of these predictions, MSi2Z4
monolayers yield a new platform to study excitons and are attractive for
optoelectronic devices, also in the forms of heterostructures. In addition, a
spin-orbit induced bands inversion is observed in the heaviest studied
compound, WSi2Sb4, a hallmark of its topological nature.

<h3>Dynamics of Stripe Patterns in Supersolid Spin-Orbit-Coupled Bose Gases</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10064" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10064</a>
<br>
<i>Kevin T. Geier, Giovanni I. Martone, Philipp Hauke, Wolfgang Ketterle, Sandro Stringari</i>
<br>
<br>
Despite groundbreaking observations of supersolidity in spin-orbit-coupled
Bose-Einstein condensates, until now the dynamics of the emerging
spatially-periodic density modulations has been vastly unexplored. Here, we
study the dynamic behavior of density stripes in such a supersolid condensate
subject to spin perturbations. We show both analytically in infinite systems
and numerically in presence of a harmonic trap how spin waves affect the
supersolid's density profile in the form of crystal waves, inducing
oscillations of the periodicity as well as the orientation of the fringes. Both
these features are well within reach of present-day experiments. Our results
show that this system is a paradigmatic supersolid, featuring superfluidity in
conjunction with a fully dynamic crystalline structure.

<h3>Analysis of ab-initio total energies obtained by different DFT  implementations</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
Ab-initio crystal structure prediction depends on accurate calculation of the
energies of competing structures. Many DFT codes are available that utilize
different approaches to solve the Kohn-Sham equation. We evaluate the
consistency of three software packages (WIEN2k, VASP and MuST) that utilize
three different methods (FL-APW, plane-wave pseudopotential and the KKR-Green's
Function methods) by comparing the relative total energies obtained for a set
of BCC and FCC binary metallic alloys. We focus on the impact of choices such
as muffin-tin $vs.$ full-potential, angular momentum cutoff and other important
KKR parameters. Different alloy systems prove more or less sensitive to these
choices, and we explain the differences through study of the angular variation
of their potentials. Our results can provide guidance in the application of KKR
as a total energy method for structure prediction.

<h3>Influence of particle geometry on dispersion force</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10079" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10079</a>
<br>
<i>Yifei Liu, Heping Xie, Cunbao Li, Dong-Sheng Jeng, Bonan Zhang</i>
<br>
<br>
Dispersion forces (van der Waals force and Casimir force) originating from
quantum fluctuations are crucial in the cohesion of microscale and nanoscale
particles. In reality, these particles have a variety of irregular shapes that
differ considerably from any idealized geometry. Previous experiments have
demonstrated that dispersion forces strongly depend on the geometry. Because of
the nonadditivity of these forces, commonly used numerical additive methods,
such as the Hamaker and Derjaguin approximations, are not suitable for
calculations with complex geometries. Moreover, experimental studies are
difficult to identify the contributions of the dispersion force from the many
forces that constitute the cohesion. Therefore, no general law about the
influence of particle geometry on dispersion forces has been established. Thus,
in this paper, the fluctuating surface current (FSC) technique, an exact
scattering theory-based nonadditive algorithm, was used to study this
influence. To characterize complex geometries, a data-adaptive spatial
filtering method was introduced to perform scale decomposition, and descriptors
at three observation levels (global, local, and surface) were used. Based on
the advanced geometric analyses and accurate numerical calculations, the
influence of multiscale surface fluctuations on dispersion forces was
determined. Furthermore, a convenient formula for predicting the dispersion
forces between particles with complex shapes from the exact Lifshitz solution
was established via multistage corrections.

<h3>Scale Invariance in the Lowest Landau Level</h3>

We show that the discrete set of pair amplitudes $A_m$ introduced by Haldane
are an angular-momentum resolved generalization of the Tan two-body contact.
They provide a complete description of translation-invariant and
rotation-invariant states in the lowest Landau level (LLL), both compressible
and incompressible. To leading nontrivial order beyond the non-interacting
high-temperature limit, they are determined analytically in terms of the
Haldane pseudopotential parameters $V_m$, which provides a qualitative
description of the crossover towards incompressible ground states for different
filling factors. Moreover, we show that for contact interactions $\sim g_2
\delta^{(2)}(\mathbf{x})$, which are scale invariant at the classical level,
the non-commutativity of the guiding center coordinates gives rise to a quantum
anomaly in the commutator $i [\hat{H}_{\rm LLL}, \hat{D}_R] = (2 + \ell
\partial_\ell) \hat{H}_{\rm LLL}$ with the dilatation operator $\hat{D}_R$ in
the LLL in addition to an interaction-induced scale anomaly. The
interaction-induced breaking of scale invariance gives rise to a finite
frequency shift of the breathing mode in a harmonic trap, which describes
transitions between different Landau levels, the strength of which is estimated
in terms of the relevant dimensionless coupling constant $\tilde{g}_2$.

We study the phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model at
unit filling for the scalar bosons and half filling for the $S=1/2$ fermions
using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The bare interaction between the
fermions is set to zero. A central question of our study is what type of
interactions can be induced between the fermions by the bosons, for both weak
and strong interspecies coupling. We find that the induced interactions can
lead to competing instabilities favoring phase separation, superconducting
phases, and density wave structures, in many cases at work on length scales of
more than 100 sites. Marginal bosonic superfluids with a density matrix
decaying faster than what is allowed for pure bosonic systems with on-site
interactions, are also found.

Building on discoveries in graphene and two-dimensional (2D) transition metal
dichalcogenides, van der Waals (VdW) layered heterostructures - stacks of such
2D materials - are being extensively explored with resulting new discoveries of
novel electronic and magnetic properties in the ultrathin limit. Here we review
a class of naturally occurring heterostructures - so called misfits - that
combine disparate VdW layers with complex stacking. Exhibiting remarkable
structural complexity and diversity of phenomena, misfits provide a platform on
which to systematically explore the energetics and local bonding constraints of
heterostructures and how they can be used to engineer novel quantum fabrics,
electronic responsiveness, and magnetic phenomena. Like traditional classes of
layered materials, they are often exfoliatable and thus also incorporatable as
units in manually or robotically stacked heterostructures. Here we review the
known classes of misfit structures, the tools for their single crystal and thin
film synthesis, the physical properties they exhibit, and computational and
characterization tools that are unraveling their complexity. Directions for
future research are also discussed.

We study the electrical and thermal conductivity of iron at high pressures
using time-dependent density functional theory. In doing so, we particularly
consider the impact of a Hubbard correction (+\textit{U}) specifically for
regions where strong electron correlations are present. Using the TDDFT+U
methodology, we examine the anisotropy in the thermal conductivity of HCP iron,
which may provide insights into the transport properties at conditions relevant
to the core-mantle boundary and the interior of the Earth.

<h3>Majorana coupling and Kondo screening of localized spins</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10145" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10145</a>
<br>
<i>Krzysztof P. Wójcik, Piotr Majek</i>
<br>
<br>
We perform a theoretical analysis of the fate of local magnetic moment of a
quantum dot coupled to a normal metallic lead and a topological superconducting
wire hosting Majorana modes at the ends. By means of simple analytical tools
and numerical renormalization group calculations we show that the proximity of
Majorana mode reduces the magnetic moment from $1/4$, characteristic of a free
spin $1/2$, to $1/16$. The coupling to the normal lead then causes the Kondo
effect, such that the magnetic moment is fully screened below the Kondo
temperature. The latter is vastly increased for strong coupling to Majorana
mode.

<h3>Identification of a Critical Doping for Charge Order Phenomena in  Bi-2212 Cuprates via RIXS</h3>

<br>
<br>
Identifying quantum critical points (QCPs) and their associated fluctuations
may hold the key to unraveling the unusual electronic phenomena observed in
cuprate superconductors. Recently, signatures of quantum fluctuations
associated with charge order (CO) have been inferred from the anomalous
enhancement of CO excitations that accompany the reduction of the CO order
parameter in the superconducting state. To gain more insight about the
interplay between CO and superconductivity, here we investigate the doping
dependence of this phenomenon throughout the Bi-2212 cuprate phase diagram
using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu L3- edge. As doping
increases, the CO wavevector decreases, saturating at a commensurate value of
0.25 r.l.u. beyond a characteristic doping pc, where the correlation length
becomes shorter than the apparent periodicity (4a0). Such behavior is
indicative of the fluctuating nature of the CO; and the proliferation of CO
excitations in the superconducting state also appears strongest at pc,
consistent with expected behavior at a CO QCP. Intriguingly, pc appears to be
near optimal doping, where the superconducting transition temperature Tc is
maximal.

<h3>DEM-Simulation of thin elastic membranes interacting with a granulate</h3>

<br>
<i>Holger Goetz, Thorsten Pöschel</i>
<br>
<br>
For a wide range of applications, we need DEM simulations of granular matter
in contact with flexible elastic boundaries. We present a novel method to
describe the interaction between granular particles and a flexible elastic
membrane. Here, the standard mass-spring model approach is supplemented by
surface patches given by triangulation of the membrane. In contrast to standard
mass-spring models, our simulation method allows for an efficient simulation
even for large particle size dispersion. The novel method allows coarsening of
the mass-spring system leading to a substantial increase in computation
efficiency. The simulation method is demonstrated and benchmarked for a
triaxial test.

<h3>Local electronic structure of interstitial hydrogen in MgH$_2$ inferred  from muon study</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10242</a>
<br>
<i>R. Kadono, M. Hiraishi, H. Okabe, A. Koda, T. U. Ito</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnesium hydride has great potential as a solid hydrogen (H) storage
material because of its high H storage capacity of 7.6 wt%. However, its slow
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics and the high temperature of 300
$^\circ$C required for decomposition are major obstacles to small-scale
applications such as automobiles. The local electronic structure of
interstitial H in MgH$_2$ is an important fundamental knowledge in solving this
problem, which has been studied mainly based on density functional theory
(DFT). However, few experimental studies have been performed to assess the
results of DFT calculations. We have therefore introduced muon (Mu) as pseudo-H
into MgH$_2$ and investigated the corresponding interstitial H states by
analyzing their electronic and dynamical properties in detail. As a result, we
observed multiple Mu states similar to those observed in wide-gap oxides, and
found that their electronic states can be attributed to relaxed-excited states
associated with donor/acceptor levels predicted by the recently proposed
"ambipolarity model". This provides an indirect support for the DFT
calculations on which the model is based via the donor/acceptor levels. An
important implication of the muon results for improved hydrogen kinetics is
that dehydrogenation, serving as a $reduction$ for hydrides, stabilizes the
interstitial H$^-$ state.

<h3>Unveiling the anisotropic fractal magnetic domain structure in bulk  crystal of antiskyrmion-host (Fe,Ni,Pd)$_3$P by small-angle neutron  scattering</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10274" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10274</a>
<br>
<i>Kosuke Karube, Victor Ukleev, Fumitaka Kagawa, Yoshinori Tokura, Yasujiro Taguchi, Jonathan S. White</i>
<br>
<br>
Intermetallic Pd-doped (Fe,Ni)$_3$P, that crystalizes in a
non-centrosymmetric tetragonal structure with $S_4$ symmetry, has recently been
discovered to host magnetic antiskyrmions, antivortex-like topological spin
textures. In this material, uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and dipolar
interactions play a significant role, giving rise to finely branched magnetic
domain patterns near the surface of bulk crystals, as revealed by a previous
magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurement. However, small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS) is a more suitable method for characterizing bulk properties
and fractal structures at the mesoscopic length scale. In this study, using
SANS and MFM, we quantitatively investigate the magnetic domain structure in
bulk single crystals of (Fe$_{0.63}$Ni$_{0.30}$Pd$_{0.07}$)$_3$P. The SANS
results demonstrate that the magnetic domain structure exhibits anisotropic
fractal character on the length scale down to the width of the magnetic domain
walls. The fractal features are gradually lost in magnetic fields, and
different field dependences are observed at 300 K and 2 K due to a
temperature-dependent anisotropy. This study quantifies the fractality of the
highly anisotropic magnetic domain structures in an antiskyrmion material, and
highlights the versatility of SANS for the study of fractal structures in
magnetic systems.

<h3>Competing ferromagnetic superconducting states in europium-based iron  pnictides</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10312" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10312</a>
<br>
<i>Huai-Xiang Huang, Yu-Qian Cao, Xin Wan</i>
<br>
<br>
In europium-based iron pnictides superconducting Fe-planes can be influenced
by a Zeeman field originated from the neighboring Eu-planes. The field tends to
induce spin-density waves with a ferromagnetic average which coexists with the
superconducting order by forming complementary patterns of the superconducting
and magnetic order parameters in a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase and a
two-dimensional textured-superconducting phase. The hard gap around the Fermi
energy disappears in these fragile inhomogeneous superconducting states, which
features, instead, V-shaped spin-resolved local density of states. The
inhomogeneous states are also competing with either a homogeneous
superconducting or a homogeneous ferromagnetic state, manifesting the
intertwining influences of the magnetic orders in Fe and Eu planes, the
spin-density wave band structure, and the superconducting pairing order.

<h3>Boson-peak vibrational modes in glasses feature hybridized phononic and  quasilocalized excitations</h3>

<br>

A hallmark of structural glasses and other disordered solids is the emergence
of excess low-frequency vibrations, on top of the Debye spectrum $D_{\rm
Debye}(\omega)$ ($\omega$ denotes the vibrational frequency) of phonons, which
exist in any solid whose Hamiltonian is translationally invariant. These excess
vibrations -- a signature of which is a THz peak in the reduced density of
states $D(\omega)/D_{\rm Debye}(\omega)$, known as the boson peak -- have
resisted a complete theoretical understanding for decades. Here, we provide
direct numerical evidence that vibrations near the boson peak consist of
hybridizations of phonons with many quasilocalized modes, the latter were
recently shown to generically populate the low-frequency tail of the
vibrational spectra of structural glasses quenched from a melt and of
disordered crystals. Our results suggest that quasilocalized excitations exist
up to and in the vicinity of the boson-peak frequency, and hence constitute
fundamental building blocks of the excess vibrational modes in glasses.

The chemical short-range order (CSRO) in the crystalline materials influences
the properties and its effect is particularly important in the context of the
multicomponent materials. We propose a scheme for CSRO parameter or
$\mathrm{\Delta-}$parameter in terms of number of like and unlike bonds in the
multicomponent systems. The OPERA or $\bf{O}$rder $\bf{P}$arameter
$\bf{E}$ngineering for $\bf{RA}$ndom Systems scheme for both semi-canonical as
well as canonical ensemble is proposed. The proposed framework provides a
high-throughput scheme for exploration of the CSRO in terms of the
$\mathrm{\Delta-}$parameter. We demonstrate the applicability of the
$\mathrm{\Delta-}$parameter for describing the CSRO in multicomponent alloys
and oxides (FCC-CoCrNi, BCC-MoNbTaW and (CoCuMgNiZn)O). We show that the
$\mathrm{\Delta-}$parameter not only inherits the merit of Warren-Cowley order
parameter, but it also addresses its limitations. The
$\mathrm{\Delta-}$parameter being a scalar quantity can represent the chemical
order and OPERA framework can deal with both semi-canonical and canonical
ensemble

The development of materials with a preferred thermal expansion is essential
to achieve negative or zero thermal expansion. Recently, CuAl2-type CoZr2 has
been reported to exhibit c-axis negative thermal expansion over a wide
temperature range. In this study, we show the temperature evolution of lattice
constants for NiZr2, (Co,Rh,Ir)Zr2, and (Co,Ni,Cu,Rh,Ir)Zr2 with a CuAl2-type
structure (space group #140). We revealed that the lattice constants a and c of
NiZr2 expand on warming, which is positive thermal expansion. Conversely,
(Co,Rh,Ir)Zr2 and (Co,Ni,Cu,Rh,Ir)Zr2 exhibit anisotropic thermal expansion
with a c-axis contraction indicating negative thermal expansion. The plot of
c-axis thermal expansion amplitude as a function of the ratio of lattice
constants c and a (c/a) for the examined compounds and related TrZr2 suggests
that the c-axis thermal expansion can be controlled by tuning c/a through the
Tr-site substitution. The results provide a design guideline for negative
thermal expansion of the c-axis in TrZr2, achieving zero thermal expansion in a
single compound.

In a world where capture and separation processes represent above 10% of
global energy consumption, novel porous materials, such as Metal-Organic
Frameworks (MOFs) used in adsorption-based processes are a promising
alternative to dethrone the high-energy-demanding distillation. Shape and size
tailor-made pores in combination with Lewis acidic sites can enhance the
adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of
adsorption is essential to designing and optimizing capture and separation
processes. Herein, we analyze the adsorption behaviour of light hydrocarbons
(methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene) in two synthesized
copper-based MOFs, Cu-MOF-74 and URJC-1. The experimental and computational
adsorption curves reveal a limited effect of the exposed metal centers on the
olefins. The lower interaction Cu-olefin is also reflected in the calculated
enthalpy of adsorption and binding geometries. Moreover, the diamond-shaped
pores' deformation upon external stimuli is first reported in URJC-1. This
phenomenon is highlighted as the key to understanding the adsorbent's
responsive mechanisms and potential in future industrial applications.

We investigate the imaging properties of copper-based superlens surrounded by
copper oxide (Cu$_2$O). A subwavelength image resolution of the order
$\lambda/9$ is demonstrated theoretically and verified in numerical
simulations. It is shown that the existence of excitons in Cu$_2$O influence
the static and dynamical optical properties of the lens. In particular, an
improvement of image quality caused by absorption in the spectral region of
excitonic resonances is investigated. The plasmon-exciton interaction in the
system may pave the way to a tunable, highly nonlinear superlens designs.

Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a critical
global challenge; it demands advances at the levels of materials, devices, and
systems for the efficient harvesting, storage, conversion, and management of
renewable energy. Researchers globally have begun incorporating machine
learning (ML) techniques with the aim of accelerating these advances. ML
technologies leverage statistical trends in data to build models for prediction
of material properties, generation of candidate structures, optimization of
processes, among other uses; as a result, they can be incorporated into
discovery and development pipelines to accelerate progress. Here we review
recent advances in ML-driven energy research, outline current and future
challenges, and describe what is required moving forward to best lever ML
techniques. To start, we give an overview of key ML concepts. We then introduce
a set of key performance indicators to help compare the benefits of different
ML-accelerated workflows for energy research. We discuss and evaluate the
latest advances in applying ML to the development of energy harvesting
(photovoltaics), storage (batteries), conversion (electrocatalysis), and
management (smart grids). Finally, we offer an outlook of potential research
areas in the energy field that stand to further benefit from the application of
ML.

<br>
<br>
Thin film metallic glasses undergoing devitrification can form partially
crystallized or fully crystallized materials with novel structural and magnetic
properties. The development of desired and tunable properties of such systems
drives the need to understand the mechanism of their thermal evolution at the
atomic level. Co-sputtered amorphous Ni-Zr alloy thin films which were
thermally annealed in steps of 200 deg C from room temperature up to 800 deg C,
were observed to undergo an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation. Evolutions
in local atomic structure, including oxide formation and depletion during this
devitrification process, were determined using a combination of X-ray
reflectivity (XRR), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and Extended
X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) techniques. The most probable phase of
the alloy was determined as Ni7Zr2; undergoing a polymorphous transformation.
The slight oxide content in the films was also noted to decrease rapidly as
annealing proceeded; leaving the crystallization pathway unhindered. Modelling
and analyses of XRR and GIXRD data showed that film thickness decreased with
annealing while long range order increased. Pair distribution function peak
widths were observed to decrease with annealing, indicating a control over
structural disorder in the system as it transitioned from the amorphous to
crystalline state. Partial atomic distribution in the environment of each
constituent was examined at every stage of annealing through EXAFS
measurements, which gave proper insight into atomic scale changes to the order
present. Detailed analyses through these techniques gave coherent results, thus
providing a true picture of the thermal evolution process of devitrification in
this technologically useful material.

We theoretically calculate the density dynamic structure factor of
one-dimensional Fermi superfluid with Raman-type spin-orbit coupling, and
analyze its main dynamical character during phase transition between
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superfluid and topological superfluid. Our
theoretical results display four kinds of single-particle excitations induced
by the two-branch structure of single-particle spectrum, and the cross
single-particle excitation is much easier to be seen in the spin dynamic
structure factor at a small transferred momentum. Also we find a new roton-like
collective mode emerges at a fixed transferred momentum $q \simeq 2k_F$, and it
only appears once the system enters the topological superfluid state. The
occurrence of this roton-like excitation is related to switch of global minimum
in single-particle spectrum from $k=0$ to $k \simeq 2k_F$.

<h3>Longitudinal optical conductivities in tilted Dirac bands</h3>

<br>
<br>
We report a unified theory based on linear response, for analyzing the
longitudinal optical conductivity (LOC) of materials with tilted Dirac cones.
Depending on the tilt parameter $t$, the Dirac electrons have four phases,
untilted, type-I, type-II, and type-III; the Dirac dispersion can be isotropic
or anisotropic; the spatial dimension of the material can be one-, two-, or
three-dimensions. The interband LOCs and intraband LOCs in $d$ dimension (with
$d\ge2$) are found to scale as to $\sigma_{0}\omega^{d-2}$ and
$\sigma_{0}|\mu|^{d-1}\delta(\omega)$, respectively, where $\omega$ is the
frequency and $\mu$ the chemical potential. The interband LOCs always vanish in
one dimension due to lacking of extra spatial dimension. The angular dependence
of LOCs is found to characterize the band tilting, and the constant asymptotic
background values of LOC reflect features of the Dirac bands. The LOCs in the
anisotropic tilted Dirac cone can be connected to its isotropic counterpart by
a ratio that consists of Fermi velocities. The findings are valid for a great
many Dirac materials in the spatial dimensions of physical interests.

Transport measurement of electron optics in monolayer graphene p-n junction
devices has been traditionally studied with negative refraction and chiral
transmission experiments in Hallbar magnetic focusing set-ups. We show direct
signatures of Klein (monolayer) and anti-Klein (bilayer) tunneling with a
circular 'edgeless' Corbino geometry made out of gated graphene p-n junctions.
Noticeable in particular is the appearance of angular sweet spots (Brewster
angles) in the magnetoconductance data of bilayer graphene, which minimizes
head-on transmission, contrary to conventional Fresnel optics or monolayer
graphene which shows instead a sharpened collimation of transmission paths. The
local maxima on the bilayer magnetoconductance plots migrate to higher fields
with increasing doping density. These experimental results are in good
agreement with detailed numerical simulations and analytical predictions.

<br>
<br>
Nonreciprocal charge transport phenomena are widely studied in
two-dimensional superconductors, which demonstrate unidirectional-anisotropy
magnetoresistances as a result of symmetry breaking. Here, we report a strong
nonreciprocal transport phenomenon in superconducting CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ thin
flakes. The second harmonic voltages, mainly originating from the rectification
effect of vortex motion, are unambiguously developed with in-plane and
out-of-plane magnetic fields, and their magnitudes are comparable to those in
noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The second harmonic magnetoresistances
split into several peaks and some of them reverse their signs by ramping the
magnetic field or the current within the superconducting transition. The
nonreciprocity suggests a strong asymmetry in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. The
centrosymmetric structure and symmetric electronic phases in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$
can hardly induce the distinct nonreciprocal transport phenomenon, which could
be correlated to a symmetry breaking from an unconventional superconducting
order parameter symmetry.

<h3>Effect of many-body interaction on de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in  insulators</h3>

<br>
<i>Gurpreet Singh, Hridis K. Pal</i>
<br>
<br>
De Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are oscillations in the magnetization
as a function of the inverse magnetic field. These oscillations are usually
considered to be a property of the Fermi surface and, hence, a metallic
property. Recently, however, such oscillations have been shown to arise, both
experimentally and theoretically, in certain insulators which have a narrow gap
and an inverted band structure. In this work, we develop a theory to study the
effect of many-body interaction on these unconventional oscillations,
perturbatively to leading order in the interaction strength. We find that
interaction has an unusual effect on oscillations in insulators: It may enhance
the amplitude in contrast to that in metals where it typically reduces the
amplitude. The enhancement occurs both at zero and nonzero temperature and can
be substantial in the regime where the gap parameter is comparable to the
Landau level spacing.

<h3>Modelling of spin decoherence in a Si hole qubit perturbed by a single  charge fluctuator</h3>

Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are one of the promizing devices to
realize a quantum processor. A better knowledge of the noise sources affecting
the coherence of such a qubit is therefore of prime importance. In this work,
we study the effect of telegraphic noise induced by the fluctuation of a single
electric charge. We simulate as realistically as possible a hole spin qubit in
a quantum dot defined electrostatically by a set of gates along a silicon
nanowire channel. Calculations combining Poisson and time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equations allow to simulate the relaxation and the dephasing of
the hole spin as a function of time for a classical random telegraph signal. We
show that dephasing time $T_2$ is well given by a two-level model in a wide
range of frequency. Remarkably, in the most realistic configuration of a low
frequency fluctuator, the system has a non-Gaussian behavior in which the phase
coherence is lost as soon as the fluctuator has changed state. The Gaussian
description becomes valid only beyond a threshold frequency $\omega_{th}$, when
the two-level system reacts to the statistical distribution of the fluctuator
states. We show that the dephasing time $T_{2}(\omega_{th})$ at this threshold
frequency can be considerably increased by playing on the orientation of the
magnetic field and the gate potentials, by running the qubit along "sweet"
lines. However, $T_{2}(\omega_{th})$ remains bounded due to dephasing induced
by the non-diagonal terms of the stochastic perturbation Hamiltonian. Our
simulations reveal that the spin relaxation cannot be described cleanly in the
two-level model because the coupling to higher energy hole levels impacts very
strongly the spin decoherence. This result suggests that multi-level
simulations including the coupling to phonons should be necessary to describe
the relaxation phenomenon in this type of qubit.

<br>
<br>
De-noising plays a crucial role in the post-processing of spectra. Machine
learning-based methods show good performance in extracting intrinsic
information from noisy data, but often require a high-quality training set that
is typically inaccessible in real experimental measurements. Here, using
spectra in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) as an example, we
develop a de-noising method for extracting intrinsic spectral information
without the need for a training set. This is possible as our method leverages
the self-correlation information of the spectra themselves. It preserves the
intrinsic energy band features and thus facilitates further analysis and
processing. Moreover, since our method is not limited by specific properties of
the training set compared to previous ones, it may well be extended to other
fields and application scenarios where obtaining high-quality multidimensional
training data is challenging.

Due to their disordered structure, glasses present a unique challenge in
predicting the composition-property relationships. Recently, several attempts
have been made to predict the glass properties using machine learning
techniques. However, these techniques have the limitations, namely, (i)
predictions are limited to the components that are present in the original
dataset, and (ii) predictions towards the extreme values of the properties,
important regions for new materials discovery, are not very reliable due to the
sparse datapoints in this region. To address these challenges, here we present
a low complexity neural network (LCNN) that provides improved performance in
predicting the properties of oxide glasses. In addition, we combine the LCNN
with physical and chemical descriptors that allow the development of universal
models that can provide predictions for components beyond the training set. By
training on a large dataset (~50000) of glass components, we show the LCNN
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as XGBoost. In addition, we
interpret the LCNN models using Shapely additive explanations to gain insights
into the role played by the descriptors in governing the property. Finally, we
demonstrate the universality of the LCNN models by predicting the properties
for glasses with new components that were not present in the original training
set. Altogether, the present approach provides a promising direction towards
accelerated discovery of novel glass compositions.

<h3>Heat current magnification in Classical and Quantum spin networks</h3>

<br>

<br>
We investigate heat current magnification due to asymmetry in the number of
spins in two-branched classical and quantum spin systems. We begin by studying
the classical Ising like spin models using Q2R and CCA dynamics and show that
just the asymmetry in the number of spins is not enough and some other source
of asymmetry is required to observe heat current magnification. Asymmetric
spin--spin interaction strengths in the upper and lower branch is employed as
the source of this asymmetry and it proves adequate for generating current
magnification in both the models. Suitable physical motivation is then provided
for current magnification in these systems along with ways to control and
manipulate magnification through various system parameters. We also study a
five spin Quantum system with modified Heisenberg XXZ interaction and preserved
magnetisation using the Redfield master equation and show that it is possible
to generate current magnification just by the asymmetry in the number of spins
in this model. Our results indicate the dependence of circulating currents on
population inversion and correlation with spin--spin entanglement. Finally,
optimisation of the current magnification is studied by suitable tuning of
parameters in this model.

We investigate the temperature dependence of quasiparticle interference in
the high $T_c$-cuprates using a Exact-Diagonalization + Monte-Carlo based
scheme to simulate the $d$-wave superconducting order parameter. Our findings
suggest that the features of quasiparticle interference in the pseudogap region
of the phase diagram are dominated by a new set of scattering vectors different
from those belonging to the octet model and they are dependent on the size of
the antinodal gap persisting beyond $T_c$. The features are increasingly
broadened as temperature increases. The quasiparticle interference patterns,
however, have features largely resulting from the scattering vectors of the
octet model at lower temperature.

The Lindblad master equation is one of the main approaches to open quantum
systems. While it has been widely applied in the context of condensed matter
systems to study properties of steady states in the limit of long times, the
actual route to such steady states has attracted less attention yet. Here, we
investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of spin chains with a local coupling to
a single Lindblad bath and analyze the transport properties of the induced
magnetization. Combining typicality and equilibration arguments with stochastic
unraveling, we unveil for the case of weak driving that the dynamics in the
open system can be constructed on the basis of correlation functions in the
closed system, which establishes a connection between the Lindblad approach and
linear response theory at finite times. This connection particularly implies
that closed and open approaches to quantum transport have to agree strictly if
applied appropriately. We demonstrate this fact numerically for the spin-1/2
XXZ chain at the isotropic point and in the easy-axis regime, where
superdiffusive and diffusive scaling is observed, respectively.

Broken Galilean invariance in a spin-orbit coupled system can amplify
many-body effects on its different responses. We study the anomalous Hall and
spin Hall conductivities of a magnetic two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. We show that both of these conductivities in the intrinsic
limit are fully specified in terms of the longitudinal and transverse spin-spin
response functions. We include the effect of electron-electron interaction in
the spin-spin linear response functions, going beyond the random-phase
approximation. We do this by incorporating the local-field correction in the
response functions, which takes into account the many-body exchange-correlation
effects. We observe a significant enhancement of the static anomalous Hall
conductivity due to the electron-electron interaction. The many-body correction
on the spin Hall effects is more non-trivial, and strong electron-electron
interaction can even reverse the sign of the static spin Hall conductivity.

Quantum states of a few-particle system capacitively coupled to a metal gate
can be discriminated by measuring the quantum capacitance, which can be
identified with the second derivative of the system energy with respect to the
gate voltage. This approach is here generalized to the multi-voltage case,
through the introduction of the quantum capacitance matrix. The matrix
formalism allows us to determine the dependence of the quantum capacitance on
the direction of the voltage oscillations in the parameter space, and to
identify the optimal combination of gate voltages. This approach is applied to
the case of a quantum-dot array, described in terms of a Hubbard model. Here,
we first identify the potentially relevant regions in the multi-dimensional
voltage space with the boundaries between charge stability regions, determined
within a semiclassical approach. Then, we quantitatively characterize such
boundaries by means of the quantum capacitance matrix. Altogether, this
provides a procedure for optimizing the discrimination between states with
different particle numbers and/or total spins.

We consider the effect of inter-atom interactions on the condensation
temperature $T_c$ of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. We find an analytic
expression of the shift in $T_c$ induced by interactions with respect the ideal
non-interacting case, in the mean-field and semi-classical approximations. Such
a shift is expressed in terms of the ratio $a/\lambda_{T_c}$ between the s-wave
scattering length $a$ and the thermal wavelength $\lambda_{T_c}$. This result
is used to discuss the tension between mean-field predictions and observations
in strongly interacting $^{39}K$ condensates. It is shown that such a tension
is solved taking into account the details of the Feshbach resonance used to
tune $a$ in the experiments.

BCS theory has been widely successful at describing elemental bulk
superconductors. Yet, as the length scales of such superconductors approach the
atomic limit, dimensionality as well as the environment of the superconductor
can lead to drastically different and unpredictable superconducting behavior.
Here, we report a threefold enhancement of the superconducting critical
temperature and gap size in ultrathin epitaxial Al films on Si(111), when
approaching the 2D limit, based on high-resolution scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements. In magnetic field, the Al films
show type II behavior and the Meservey-Tedrow-Fulde (MTF) effect for in-plane
magnetic fields. Using spatially resolved spectroscopy, we characterize the
vortex structure in the MTF regime and find strong deviations from the typical
Abrikosov vortex. We corroborate these findings with calculations that unveil
the role of odd-frequency pairing and a paramagnetic Meissner effect. These
results illustrate two striking influences of reduced dimensionality on a BCS
superconductor and present a new platform to study BCS superconductivity in
large magnetic fields.

After a decade of intense theoretical and experimental efforts, demonstrating
braiding of Majorana modes remains an unsolved problem in condensed matter
physics due to platform specific challenges. In this work, we propose
topological superconductor -- magnetic multilayer heterostructures with on-chip
microwave cavity readout as a novel platform for initializing, braiding and
reading out Majorana modes. Stray fields from a skyrmion in the magnetic layers
can nucleate a vortex in the topological superconducting layer. Such a vortex
is known to host Majorana bound states at its core. Through analytical
calculations within London and Thiele formalisms, and through micromagnetic
simulations, we show that our nucleation and braiding scheme can be effectively
realized with a variety of existing options for magnetic and superconducting
layers. Further, we show that the coupling of the Majorana bound states to
electric field of a resonator leads to an experimentally observable
parity-dependent dispersive shift of the resonator frequency. Our work paves
the way for realizing Majorana braiding in the near future.

In a polar solid, electrons or other charge carriers can interact with the
phonons of the ionic lattice, leading to the formation of polaron
quasiparticles. The optical conductivity and optical absorption spectrum of a
material are affected by this electron-phonon coupling, most notably leading to
an absorption peak in the mid-infrared region. Recently, a model Hamiltonian
for anharmonic electron-phonon coupling was derived [M. Houtput and J. Tempere,
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{103}, 184306 (2021)], that includes both the conventional
Fr\"ohlich interaction as well an interaction where an electron interacts with
two phonons simultaneously. In this article, we calculate and investigate the
optical conductivity of the anharmonic large polaron gas, and show that an
additional characteristic absorption peak appears due to this
1-electron-2-phonon interaction.
We calculate a semi-analytical expression for the optical conductivity
$\sigma(\omega)$ at finite temperatures and weak coupling using the Kubo
formula. The electronic and phononic contributions can be split and treated
separately, such that the many-body effects of the electron gas may be taken
into account through the well-known dynamical structure factor
$S(\mathbf{k},\omega)$. From the resulting optical conductivity, we calculate
the polaron effective mass, an estimate for the electron-phonon scattering
times, and the optical absorption spectrum of the anharmonic polaron gas. We
show that alongside the well-known polaron absorption peak at the phonon energy
$\hbar \omega_{\text{LO}}$, the 1-electron-2-phonon interaction leads to an
additional absorption peak at $2 \hbar \omega_{\text{LO}}$. We propose this
absorption peak as an experimentally measurable indicator for nonnegligible
1-electron-2-phonon interaction in a material, since the height of this peak is
proportional to the strength of this anharmonic interaction.

This paper proposes a machine learning (ML) method to predict stable
molecular geometries from their chemical composition. The method is useful for
generating molecular conformations which may serve as initial geometries for
saving time during expensive structure optimizations by quantum mechanical
calculations of large molecules. Conformations are found by predicting the
local arrangement around each atom in the molecule after trained from a
database of previously optimized small molecules. It works by dividing each
molecule in the database into minimal building blocks of different type. The
algorithm is then trained to predict bond lengths and angles for each type of
building block using an electro-topological fingerprint as descriptor. A
conformation is then generated by joining the predicted blocks. Our model is
able to give promising results for optimized molecular geometries from the
basic knowledge of the chemical formula and connectivity. The method trends to
reproduce interatomic distances within test blocks with RMSD under $0.05$ \r{A}

Regression models usually tend to recover a noisy signal in the form of a
combination of regressors, also called features in machine learning, themselves
being the result of a learning process.The alignment of the prior covariance
feature matrix with the signal is known to play a key role in the
generalization properties of the model, i.e. its ability to make predictions on
unseen data during training. We present a statistical physics picture of the
learning process. First we revisit the ridge regression to obtain compact
asymptotic expressions for train and test errors, rendering manifest the
conditions under which efficient generalization occurs. It is established
thanks to an exact test-train sample error ratio combined with random matrix
properties. Along the way in the form of a self-energy emerges an effective
ridge penalty \textemdash\ precisely the train to test error ratio \textemdash\
which offer a very simple parameterization of the problem. This formulation
appears convenient to tackle the learning process of the feature matrix itself.
We derive an autonomous dynamical system in terms of elementary degrees of
freedom of the problem determining the evolution of the relative alignment
between the population matrix and the signal. A macroscopic counterpart of
these equations is also obtained and various dynamical mechanisms are unveiled,
allowing one to interpret the dynamics of simulated learning processes and
reproduce trajectories of single experimental run with high precision.

<h3>Self- and Mutual Inductance of NbN and Bilayer NbN/Nb Inductors in  Planarized Fabrication Process With Nb Ground Planes</h3>

We present measurements of self- and mutual inductance of NbN and bilayer
NbN/Nb inductors (microstrips, striplines, serpentines, etc.) with Nb ground
plane(s) fabricated in an advanced process node developed for superconductor
electronics at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. In this process, the signal traces of
logic cell inductors are made either of a 200-nm NbN layer with $T_c$=16 K or
of an in-situ deposited NbN/Nb bilayer with 100 /100 nm layer thicknesses,
replacing a 200-nm Nb layer M6 in the standard SFQ5ee process with nine
superconducting layers on 200-mm wafers. Nb ground planes were preserved to
maintain a high level of interlayer shielding and low intralayer mutual
coupling. We determined magnetic field penetration depth in the NbN films to be
$\lambda$ = 491 +/- 5 nm, corresponding to kinetic inductance of 200-nm films
of 1.51 pH/sq. A two-step patterning of the top Nb and the bottom NbN layers of
the NbN/Nb bilayer allows to create inductors in a very wide range of linear
inductance values, from low values ~ 0.4 pH/$\mu$m typical for Nb geometrical
inductors to ~ 35 pH/$\mu$m typical to thin-film kinetic inductors. This is
achieved by changing the bilayer linewidth and size of the etched away Nb.
Mutual inductance of NbN and Nb inductors, of NbN inductors, and of bilayer
inductors is the same as between two Nb inductors with the same geometry and
placement between the ground planes, i.e., mutual inductance does not depend on
superconducting properties of the signal traces in the studied range of
linewidths. Results of the measurements agree with analytical expressions and
numerical simulations within a few percent in the studied range of linewidths
from 250 nm to 4 $\mu$m. Implementation of NbN and NbN/Nb bilayer inductors
allows for a significant increase in the circuit density and integration scale
of superconductor digital electronics.

Previously it was shown that P:$\delta$-layers - atomically thin sheets of
phosphorus dopants in silicon - produce a distinct Drude tail feature in
ellipsometry measurements [1,2]. However, the ellipsometric spectra could not
be properly fit by modeling the $\delta$-layer as a discrete layer of classical
Drude metal. In particular, even for large broadening corresponding to
extremely short relaxation times, a plasma resonance feature was anticipated
but not evident in the experimental data, suggesting a more physically accurate
description is required. In this work we develop a model taking into account
the strong charge density confinement and resulting quantum mechanical
description of a P:$\delta$-layer. We show that the absence of a plasma
resonance feature results from a combination of two factors: i), the sharply
varying charge density profile due to a strong confinement in the direction of
growth; and ii), the effective mass and relaxation time anisotropy due to
valley degeneracy. The plasma resonance reappears when the atoms composing the
$\delta$-layer are allowed to diffuse out from the plane of the layer,
destroying its well-confined 2D character. In essence, the observed plasma
resonance suppression is a unique signature originating from the quantum
confinement effects intrinsic to $\delta$-layers. We are thus able to
demonstrate that ellipsometry spectra for P:$\delta$-layers can not only be
effectively modeled, but used to roughly assess P:$\delta$-layer quality and
characteristics.

It is desirable to relate entanglement of many-body systems to measurable
observables. In systems with a conserved charge, it was recently shown that the
number entanglement entropy (NEE) - i.e. the entropy change due to an
unselective subsystem charge measurement - is an entanglement monotone. Here we
derive finite-temperature equilibrium relations between Renyi moments of the
NEE, and multi-point charge correlations. These relations are exemplified in
quantum dot systems where the desired charge correlations can be measured via a
nearby quantum point contact. In quantum dots recently realizing the
multi-channel Kondo effect we show that the NEE has a nontrivial universal
temperature dependence which is now accessible using the proposed methods.

Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) can host surface states whose
anomalous band structure inherits the characteristics of the crystalline
symmetry that protects the bulk topology. Especially, in magnetic crystals, the
diversity of magnetic crystalline symmetries indicates the potential to achieve
novel magnetic TCIs with distinct surface characteristics. Here, we propose a
new type of magnetic TCI, coined the topological magnetic Dirac insulator
(TMDI), whose two-dimensional (2D) surface hosts fourfold-degenerate Dirac
fermions protected by either $p'_c4mm$ or $p4'g'm$ magnetic wallpaper groups
(MWGs). The bulk band topology of TMDIs is protected by diagonal mirror
symmetries, which give the chiral dispersion of surface Dirac fermions and
mirror-protected hinge modes. We also propose a class of candidate materials
for TMDIs including Nd$_4$Te$_8$Cl$_4$O$_{20}$ and DyB$_4$ based on
first-principle calculations, and construct a general scheme to search TMDIs
using the space group symmetry of paramagnetic parent states. We believe that
our theoretical discovery of TMDIs and their anomalous surface Dirac fermions
would facilitate the future research of new magnetic TCIs and illustrate a
distinct way to achieve anomalous surface states in magnetic crystals.

In this paper, I present an analysis of the electrical resistance graphs in
Nature volume 586, pages 373-377 (2020), which reported the discovery of room
temperature superconductivity in a carbonaceous sulfur hydride and was
subsequently retracted on September 26th, 2022. I show that, over a single
temperature interval, the electrical resistance data can be decomposed into at
least two signals of differing digital precision, thus raising questions
concerning the methods used to obtain the published data. Since the raw
data-files for the electrical resistance measurements have not been made
available, in order to perform this analysis, I have developed a set of python
scripts to extract the data-points with high precision from the internal
structure of the vector graphics image files. I describe the data extraction
method. Example code and the resulting electrical resistance vs temperature
data-files are made available in public repositories.

Space-fractional quantum mechanics (SFQM) is a generalization of the standard
quantum mechanics when the Brownian trajectories in Feynman path integrals are
replaced by Levy flights. We introduce Levy quasicrystal by discretizing the
space-fractional Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation using the
Gr$\ddot{\text{u}}$nwald-Letnikov derivatives and adding on-site quasiperiodic
potential. The discretized version of the usual Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger
equation maps to the Aubry-Andre Hamiltonian, which supports
localization-delocalization transition even in one dimension. We find that the
Levy quasicrystal also shows a delocalization-localization transition as one
tune the quasiperiodic potential strength and most interestingly, unlike the
Aubry-Andre (AA) Hamiltonian, for a certain range of parameters, it also shows
the coexistence of localized and delocalized states separated by mobility edge.
Finally, we also propose a potential experimental realization of the Levy
quasicrystal by mapping it to a AA model with power-law hopping.
