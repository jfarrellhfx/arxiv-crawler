<h3>Dissipative particle dynamics for coarse-grained models</h3>

<i>Tine Curk</i>
<p>We develop a computational method based on Dissipative Particle Dynamics
(DPD) that introduces solvent hydrodynamic interactions to coarse-grained
models of solutes, such as ions, molecules, or polymers. DPD-solvent (DPDS) is
a fully off-lattice method that allows straightforward incorporation of
hydrodynamics at desired solvent viscosity, compressibility and solute
diffusivity with any particle-based solute model. Solutes interact with the
solvent only through the DPD thermostat, which ensures that the equilibrium
properties of the solute system are not affected by the introduction of the DPD
solvent. Thus, DPDS can be used as a replacement for traditional molecular
dynamics thermostats such as Nos\'e-Hoover and Langevin. We demonstrate the
applicability of DPDS on the case of polymer dynamics and electroosmotic flow
through a nanopore. The method should be broadly useful as means to introduce
hydrodynamics to existing coarse-grained models of molecules and soft
materials.

<h3>3D model for surface accumulation of chiral and non-chiral microswimmers</h3>

<i>Danne M. van Roon, Giorgio Volpe, Margarida M. Telo da Gama, Nuno A. M. Araújo</i>
<p>Persistent motion of microswimmers near boundaries is known to result in
surface accumulation. Recently it was shown experimentally that surface
accumulation of microswimmers is impacted primarily by steric forces and
short-ranged hydrodynamics. A way to control surface accumulation is by
reducing the contact surface area between swimmers and surface by modifying its
topography, typically through the application of microscale structure. In this
work, we introduce a three-dimensional(3D) model of a microswimmer navigating a
volume bounded by a top and bottom surface. We describe the swimmer-surface
interaction with an effective short-ranged hydrodynamic alignment force, and
study numerically the effect of surface textures, modelled by convex obstacles,
on the surface accumulation of chiral and non-chiral microswimmers. We find
that, depending on the angular velocity of the swimmer, and the alignment
force, convex obstacles can either hinder or enhance surface accumulation. We
discuss potential applications to sorting of microswimmers by their angular
velocity.

<h3>Microswimmers knead nematic into cholesteric</h3>

<p>The hydrodynamic stresses created by active particles can destabilise
orientational order present in the system. This is manifested, for example, by
the appearance of a bend instability in active nematics or in
quasi-2-dimensional living liquid crystals consisting of swimming bacteria in
thin nematic films. Using large-scale scale hydrodynamics simulations, we study
a system consisting of spherical microswimmers within a 3-dimensional nematic
liquid crystal. We observe a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, where the
uniform nematic state is kneaded into a continously twisting state,
corresponding to a helical director configuration akin to a cholesteric liquid
crystal. The transition arises from the hydrodynamic coupling between the
liquid crystalline elasticity and the swimmer flow fields, leading to a
twist-bend instability of the nematic order. It is observed for both pusher
(extensile) and puller (contractile) swimmers. Further, we show that the liquid
crystal director and particle trajectories are connected: in the cholesteric
state the particle trajectories become helicoidal.

<h3>Characteristic features of the strongly-correlated regime: Lessons from  a 3-fermion one-dimensional harmonic trap</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04733" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04733</a>
<br>
<i>Victor Caliva, Johanna I Fuks</i>
<p>The transition into a strongly-correlated regime of 3 fermions trapped in a
one-dimensional harmonic potential is investigated. This interesting, but
little-studied system, allows us to identify characteristic features of the
regime, some of which are also present in strongly-correlated materials
relevant to the industry. Furthermore, our findings describe the behavior of
electrons in quantum dots, ions in Paul traps, and even fermionic atoms in
one-dimensional optical lattices. Near the ground state, all these platforms
can be described as fermions trapped in a harmonic potential. The correlation
regime can be controlled by varying the natural frequency of the trapping
potential, and to probe it, we propose to use twisted light. We identify 4
signatures of strong correlation in the one-dimensional 3-fermion trap, which
are likely to be present for any number N of trapped fermions: i) the ground
state density is strongly localized with N maximally separated peaks (Wigner
Crystal) ii) the symmetric and antisymmetric ground state wavefunctions become
degenerate (bosonization) iii) the von Neumann entropy grows, iv) the energy
spectrum is fully characterized by N normal modes or less.

<h3>Coulomb universality</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04761" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04761</a>
<br>
<i>Leo Radzihovsky, John Toner</i>
<p>Motivated by a number of realizations of long-range interacting systems,
including ultra-cold atomic and molecular gases, we study a neutral plasma with
power-law interactions longer-ranged than Coulombic. We find that beyond a
crossover length, such interactions are universally screened down to a standard
Coulomb form in all spatial dimensions. This implies, counter-intuitively, that
in two dimensions, such a "super-Coulombic" gas undergoes the same
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition as a conventional Coulomb gas at an elevated
temperature that we calculate. We also predict that above two dimensions, even
when naively the bare potential is confining, there is no confined phase of the
plasma at any nonzero temperature. In addition, we show that power-law
potentials that fall off more rapidly than Coulombic are screened down to a
shorter ranged power-law, rather than an exponential Debye-Huckel Yukawa form.
We expect these prediction to be testable in simulations, and hope they will
inspire experimental studies in various platforms.

<h3>Information scrambling and butterfly velocity in quantum spin glass  chains</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04772" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04772</a>
<br>
<i>Venkata Lokesh K. Y, Surajit Bera, Sumilan Banerjee</i>
<p>We make lattice generalization of two well-known zero dimensional models of
quantum spin glass, Sachdev-Ye (SY) and spherical quantum $p$-spin glass model,
to one dimension for studying crossovers in non-local scrambling dynamics due
to glass transition, complex dynamics, and quantum and thermal fluctuations in
paramagnetic (PM) and spin glass (SG) phases. In the SY chain of quantum dots,
each described by infinite-range random Heisenberg model of $N$ spin-$S$
$SU(M)$ spins, we obtain the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and
butterfly velocity $v_B$ as a function of temperature $T$ and the quantum
parameter $S$ across the PM-SG phase boundary using a bosonic spinon
representation in the large-$N,M$ limit. In particular, we extract asymptotic
$T$ and $S$ dependence, e.g., power laws, for $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ in
different regions deep inside the phases and near the replica symmetry breaking
SG transition. We find the chaos to be non-maximal almost over the entire phase
diagram. Very similar results for chaos indicators are found for the $p$-spin
glass chain as a function of temperature and a suitable quantum parameter
$\Gamma$, with some important qualitative differences. In particular,
$\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ and $v_B$ exhibit a maximum, coinciding with onset of
complex glassy relaxation, above the glass transition as a function of $T$ and
$\Gamma$ in the PM phase of the $p$-spin glass model. In contrast, the maximum
is only observed as a function of $S$, but not with temperature, in the PM
phase of SY model. The maximum originates from enhanced chaos due to maximal
complexity in the glassy landscape. Thus, the results in the SY model indicate
very different evolution of glassy complexity with quantum and thermal
fluctuations.

<h3>Co-doping Er plus V or Er plus Nb into CaWO4</h3>

<i>Chen Yang, Robert J. Cava</i>
<p>Er3+ plus V5+, and Er3+ plus Nb5+ co-doped CaWO4, formulas Ca1-xErxW1-xMxO4,
were synthesized in air by a conventional solid-state method. A color change
from white to pink was observed in the final products. An equal fraction of
dopants was employed to obtain charge neutrality, and the limits of the
solubility for our conditions are lower than x=0.15. The magnetic
susceptibility data shows that that the magnetic coupling becomes increasingly
antiferromagnetic with increasing Er3+content. The Curie-Weiss fit and
isothermal magnetization imply that different degrees of spin-orbit coupling
appear to be present in the two doping systems. No transitions were observed in
the heat capacity data above 0.4 K.

<p>Considering the growing interest in magnetic materials for unconventional
computing, data storage, and sensor applications, there is active research not
only on material synthesis but also characterisation of their properties. In
addition to structural and integral magnetic characterisations, imaging of
magnetization patterns, current distributions and magnetic fields at nano- and
microscale is of major importance to understand the material responses and
qualify them for specific applications. In this roadmap, we aim to cover a
broad portfolio of techniques to perform nano- and microscale magnetic imaging
using SQUIDs, spin center and Hall effect magnetometries, scanning probe
microscopies, x-ray- and electron-based methods as well as magnetooptics and
nanoMRI. The roadmap is aimed as a single access point of information for
experts in the field as well as the young generation of students outlining
prospects of the development of magnetic imaging technologies for the upcoming
decade with a focus on physics, materials science, and chemistry of planar, 3D
and geometrically curved objects of different material classes including 2D
materials, complex oxides, semi-metals, multiferroics, skyrmions,
antiferromagnets, frustrated magnets, magnetic molecules/nanoparticles, ionic
conductors, superconductors, spintronic and spinorbitronic materials.

<h3>Robust spectral $π$ pairing in the random-field Floquet quantum Ising  model</h3>

<br>
<i>Harald Schmid, Alexander-Georg Penner, Kang Yang, Leonid Glazman, Felix von Oppen</i>
<p>Motivated by an experiment on a superconducting quantum processor [Mi et al.,
Science 378, 785 (2022)], we study level pairings in the many-body spectrum of
the random-field Floquet quantum Ising model. The pairings derive from Majorana
zero and $\pi$ modes when writing the spin model in Jordan-Wigner fermions.
Both splittings have lognormal distributions with random transverse fields. In
contrast, random longitudinal fields affect the zero and $\pi$ splittings in
drastically different ways. While zero pairings are rapidly lifted, the $\pi$
pairings are remarkably robust, or even strengthened, up to vastly larger
disorder strengths. We explain our results within a self-consistent Floquet
perturbation theory and study implications for boundary spin correlations. The
robustness of $\pi$ pairings against longitudinal disorder may be useful for
quantum information processing.

<h3>Monte Carlo, blocking, and inference: How to measure the renormalization  group flow</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04811" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04811</a>
<br>
<i>Luca Di Carlo</i>
<p>Renormalization group theory is a powerful and intriguing technique with a
wide range of applications. One of the main successes of renormalization group
theory is the description of continuous phase transitions and the development
of scaling theory. Most courses on phase transitions focus on scaling and
critical exponents, while less attention is paid to universality,
renormalization group flow, and the existence of a unique fixed point, which
are the ultimate reasons why scaling theory is so effective in describing
continuous phase transitions. We use a combination of Monte Carlo simulations
and real space renormalization group theory to determine the renormalization
group flow and to show the existence of a universal fixed point in the context
of the ferromagnetic Ising model.

<h3>Transmission-eigenchannel velocity and diffusion</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04818" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04818</a>
<br>
<i>Azriel Z. Genack, Yiming Huang, Asher Maor, Zhou Shi</i>
<p>The diffusion model is used to calculate the time-averaged flow of particles
in stochastic media and the propagation of waves averaged over ensembles of
disordered static configurations. For classical waves exciting static
disordered samples, such as a layer of paint or a tissue sample, the flux
transmitted through the sample may be dramatically enhanced or suppressed
relative to predictions of diffusion theory when the sample is excited by a
waveform corresponding to a transmission eigenchannel. Even so, it is widely
acknowledged that the velocity of waves is irretrievably randomized in
scattering media. Here we demonstrate in microwave measurements and numerical
simulations that the statistics of velocity of different transmission
eigenchannels remain distinct on all length scales and are identical on the
incident and output surfaces. The interplay between eigenchannel velocities and
transmission eigenvalues determines the energy density within the medium, the
diffusion coefficient, and the dynamics of propagation. the diffusion
coefficient and all scatter9ng parameters, including the scattering mean free
path, oscillate with width of the sample as the number and shape of the
propagating channels in the medium change.

<h3>Simulation of time crystal behavior for a few boson chiral soliton model  in a ring</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04843" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04843</a>
<br>
<i>Patrik Ohberg, Ewan M Wright</i>
<p>We present numerical simulations for a chiral soliton model with N=2,3 bosons
in a ring, this being a few-particle version of our previous mean-field model
for a quantum time crystal. Following Syrwid, Kosior, and Sacha (SKS), the
notion is that a precise position measurement of one particle can lead to
spontaneous formation of a bright soliton that in a time crystal should rotate
intact for at least a few revolutions around the ring. In their work SKS find
spontaneous formation of a soliton due to the position measurement, but quantum
fluctuations cause the soliton to subsequently decay before it has a chance to
perform even one revolution of the ring. Based on this they conclude that time
crystal dynamics are impossible. In contrast, for our few boson chiral soliton
model, and allowing for imprecise (weak) measurements of the particle position,
we show that time crystal behavior is possible allowing for several revolutions
of the spontaneously formed soliton around the ring. We therefore argue that
our chiral soliton model can realize a quantum time crystal when weak position
measurements are allowed for.

<h3>Discovery of a hybrid topological quantum state in an elemental solid</h3>

Cochran, Mohammad Yahyavi, Xian P. Yang, Luis Balicas, Guoqing Chang, Weisheng Zhao, Titus Neupert, M. Zahid Hasan</i>
<p>Topology and interactions are foundational concepts in the modern
understanding of quantum matter. Their nexus yields three significant research
directions: competition between distinct interactions, as in the multiple
intertwined phases, interplay between interactions and topology that drives the
phenomena in twisted layered materials and topological magnets, and the
coalescence of multiple topological orders to generate distinct novel phases.
The first two examples have grown into major areas of research, while the last
example remains mostly untouched, mainly because of the lack of a material
platform for experimental studies. Here, using tunneling microscopy,
photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical analysis, we unveil a "hybrid" and
yet novel topological phase of matter in the simple elemental solid arsenic.
Through a unique bulk-surface-edge correspondence, we uncover that arsenic
features a conjoined strong and higher-order topology, stabilizing a hybrid
topological phase. While momentum-space spectroscopy measurements show signs of
topological surface states, real-space microscopy measurements unravel a unique
geometry of topology-induced step edge conduction channels revealed on various
forms of natural nanostructures on the surface. Using theoretical models, we
show that the existence of gapless step edge states in arsenic relies on the
simultaneous presence of both a nontrivial strong Z2 invariant and a nontrivial
higher-order topological invariant, providing experimental evidence for hybrid
topology and its realization in a single crystal. Our discovery highlights
pathways to explore the interplay of different kinds of band topology and
harness the associated topological conduction channels in future engineered
quantum or nano-devices.

<h3>Immersed boundary method for dynamic simulation of polarizable colloids  of arbitrary shape in explicit ion electrolytes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04865" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04865</a>
<br>
<i>Emily Krucker-Velasquez, James W. Swan, Zachary Sherman</i>
<p>We develop a computational method for modeling electrostatic interactions of
arbitrarily-shaped, polarizable objects on colloidal length scales, including
colloids/nanoparticles, polymers, and surfactants, dispersed in explicit ion
electrolytes and nonionic solvents. Our method computes the nonuniform
polarization charge distribution induced in a colloidal particle by both
externally applied electric fields and local electric fields arising from other
charged objects in the dispersion. This leads to expressions for electrostatic
energies, forces, and torques that enable efficient molecular dynamics and
Brownian dynamics simulations of colloidal dispersions in electrolytes, which
can be harnessed to accurately predict structural and transport properties. We
describe an implementation in which colloidal particles are modeled as rigid
composites of small spherical beads that tessellate the surface of the
particle. The electrostatics calculations are accelerated using a
spectrally-accurate particle-mesh-Ewald technique implemented on a graphics
processing unit (GPU). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
through a series of calculations, including the induced dipole moments and
forces for one, two, and lattices of spherical colloids in an electric field;
the induced dipole moment and torque for anisotropic particles in an electric
field; the equilibrium distribution of ions in the double layer around charged
colloids; the dynamics of charged colloids; and ions in the double layer around
a polarizable colloid exposed to an electric field.

discovered superconductor family Sc6MTe2. Based on the electrical resistivity
and heat capacity data measured at low temperatures, Zr6FeTe2 is found to show
bulk superconductivity below Tc = 0.76 K. Zr6CoTe2 also exhibited zero
resistivity due to superconductivity below 0.13 K. In contrast, Zr6+dMn1-dTe2
does not show superconductivity but instead exhibits strong magnetism, which
most likely prevents the formation of superconductivity in this material. The
electronic properties and electronic states of Zr6MTe2 are discussed in
comparison with those of Sc6MTe2.

<h3>Real-time Impurity Solver Using Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product  Operators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04880" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04880</a>
<br>
<i>Ruofan Chen, Xiansong Xu, Chu Guo</i>
<p>An emergent and promising tensor-network-based impurity solver is to
represent the path integral as a matrix product state, where the bath is
analytically integrated out using Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Here we
present an approach to calculate the equilibrium impurity spectral function
based on the recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators
method. The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath
initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function
$G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such
that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are
two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time
dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic
continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on
imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product
states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in
imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical
efficiency. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated in the single-orbital
Anderson impurity model and benchmarked against the continuous-time quantum
Monte Carlo method.

<h3>Field-free ultrafast magnetization reversal of a nanodevice by a chirped  current pulse via spin-orbit torque</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04882" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04882</a>
<br>
<i>Y. D. Liu, M. T. Islam, T. Min, X. S. Wang, X. R. Wang</i>
<p>We investigated the magnetization reversal of a perpendicularly magnetized
nanodevice using a chirped current pulse (CCP) via spin-orbit torques (SOT).
Our findings demonstrate that both the field-like (FL) and damping-like (DL)
components of SOT in CCP can efficiently induce ultrafast magnetization
reversal without any symmetry-breaking means. For a wide frequency range of the
CCP, the minimal current density obtained is significantly smaller compared to
the current density of conventional SOT-reversal. This ultrafast reversal is
due to the CCP triggering enhanced energy absorption (emission) of the
magnetization from (to) the FL- and DL-components of SOT before (after)
crossing over the energy barrier. We also verified the robustness of the
CCP-driven magnetization reversal at room temperature. Moreover, this strategy
can be extended to switch the magnetic states of perpendicular synthetic
antiferromagnetic (SAF) and ferrimagnetic (SFi) nanodevices. Therefore, these
studies enrich the basic understanding of field-free SOT-reversal and provide a
novel way to realize ultrafast SOT-MRAM devices with various free layer
designs: ferromagnetic, SAF, and SFi.

<p>Nanoparticles, exhibiting functionally relevant structural heterogeneity, are
at the forefront of cutting-edge research. Now, high-throughput single-particle
imaging (SPI) with x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) creates unprecedented
opportunities for recovering the shape distributions of millions of particles
that exhibit functionally relevant structural heterogeneity. To realize this
potential, three challenges have to be overcome: (1) simultaneous
parametrization of structural variability in real and reciprocal spaces; (2)
efficiently inferring the latent parameters of each SPI measurement; (3)
scaling up comparisons between $10^5$ structural models and $10^6$ XFEL-SPI
measurements. Here, we describe how we overcame these three challenges to
resolve the non-equilibrium shape distributions within millions of gold
nanoparticles imaged at the European XFEL. These shape distributions allowed us
to quantify the degree of asymmetry in these particles, discover a relatively
stable `shape envelope' amongst nanoparticles, discern finite-size effects
related to shape-controlling surfactants, and extrapolate nanoparticles' shapes
to their idealized thermodynamic limit. Ultimately, these demonstrations show
that XFEL SPI can help transform nanoparticle shape characterization from
anecdotally interesting to statistically meaningful.

<p>Crystallographic defects in a topological semimetal can result in charge
doping, and the scattering due to the defects may mask its exotic transport
properties. Here, we investigate the possible crystallographic defects
including vacancy and antisite in Weyl semimetal LaAlGe using
hybrid-density-functional theory calculations. We show that a considerable
concentration of Al- and Ge-related defects naturally form during growth due to
their low formation enthalpy. Specifically, Al can be easily replaced by Ge in
the $I4_1md$ phase of LaAlGe, forming the Ge-on-Al antisite, Ge$_{\rm Al}$. The
counterpart, Al-on-Ge (Al$_{\rm Ge}$), is also probable. The most abundant
defect Ge$_{\rm Al}$ is donor-like, effectively electron-doping, and these
defects are therefore not only scattering centers in the electronic transport
process but may also induce the substantial vertical shift of the chemical
potential. The results imply that the naturally occurring defects hinder both
spectroscopic and transport features arising from the Weyl physics in LaAlGe.
Our work can be applied to the $R$AlGe family ($R$=rare earth) and help improve
the quality of single-crystal magnetic Weyl semimetal.

<p>Monolithic integration of solid-state color centers with photonic elements of
the same material is a promising approach to overcome the constraints of
fabrication complexity and coupling losses in traditional hybrid integration
approaches. A wide band-gap, low-loss silicon nitride (SiN) platform is a
mature technology, having CMOS compatibility, widely used in hybrid integrated
photonics and optoelectronics. However, it has been shown that certain growth
conditions enable the SiN material to host color centers, whose origin is
currently under investigation. In this work, we have engineered a novel
technique for the efficient coupling of these intrinsic emitters into the
whispering gallery modes (WGMs) of the SiN microring cavity -- which has not
been explored previously. We have engineered a subwavelength-sized notch into
the rim of the SiN microring structure, to optimize the collection efficiency
of the cavity-coupled enhanced photoluminescence (PL) spectra at room
temperature. The platform presented in this work will enable the development of
monolithic integration of color centers with nanophotonic elements for
application to quantum photonic technologies.

<h3>Electrical Non-Hermitian Control of Topological Magnon Spin Transport</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04967" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04967</a>
<br>
<i>Pieter M. Gunnink, Rembert A. Duine, Alexander Mook</i>
<p>Magnonic topological phases realize chiral edge spin waves that are protected
against backscattering, potentially enabling highly efficient spin transport.
Here we show that the spin transport through these magnonic chiral edge states
can be electrically manipulated by non-Hermitian control. We consider the
paradigmatic magnon Haldane model and show that it is transformed into an
effective non-Hermitian magnon Chern insulator by including a
sublattice-dependent spin-orbit torque. In linear spin-wave theory, this
electrically induced torque causes a lasing of the chiral edge magnons along
certain edge directions, leading to an enhancement of the spin-wave amplitude.
This prediction is confirmed by numerical simulations based on the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. For a spin-wave transport setup, in which
magnons are excited by a microwave field and detected with a normal metal
conductor, we find that the magnon amplification is remarkably robust against
disorder, establishing non-Hermitian control as a promising avenue for
topological magnonics.

<i>Mathijs G.C. Mientjes, Xin Guan, Pim J.H. Lueb, Marcel A. Verheijen, Erik P.A.M. Bakkers</i>
<p>Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) are interesting for their
topological surface states, which hold great promise for scattering-free
transport channels and fault-tolerant quantum computing. A promising TCI is
SnTe. However, Sn-vacancies form in SnTe, causing a high hole density,
hindering topological transport from the surface being measured. This issue
could be relieved by using nanowires with a high surface-to-volume ratio.
Furthermore, SnTe can be alloyed with Pb reducing the Sn-vacancies while
maintaining its topological phase. Here we present the catalyst-free growth of
monocrystalline PbSnTe in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). By the addition of a
pre-deposition stage before the growth, we have control over the nucleation
phase and thereby increase the nanowire yield. This facilitates tuning the
nanowire aspect ratio by a factor of four by varying the growth parameters.
These results allow us to grow specific morphologies for future transport
experiments to probe the topological surface states in a Pb1-xSnxTe-based
platform.

<p>We microscopically analyze the nearest neighbor Heisenberg model on the
maple-leaf lattice through neural quantum states (NQS) and infinite density
matrix renormalization group (iDMRG). Embarking to parameter regimes beyond the
exact dimer singlet ground state with a dimer bond spin exchange coupling $J_d$
varied against the exchange strength $J$ of all other bonds, iDMRG (NQS) finds
a dimer state paramagnetic phase for $J_d/J > 1.464$ ($J_d/J > 1.39$) and a
canted $120^\circ$ magnetic order for $J_d/J < 1.419$ ($J_d/J < 1.23$).
Assessing training convergence inaccuracies of NQS and the influence of finite
cylindric circumference for iDMRG, we discuss the possible existence of an
intermediate phase between magnet and dimer paramagnet.

<br>
<i>Eric Arturo Montoya, Xinyao Pei, Ilya N. Krivorotov</i>
<p>Spin-orbit torques enable energy-efficient manipulation of magnetization by
electric current and hold promise for applications ranging from nonvolatile
memory to neuromorphic computing. Here we report the discovery of a giant
spin-orbit torque induced by anomalous Hall current in ferromagnetic
conductors. This anomalous Hall torque is self-generated as it acts on
magnetization of the ferromagnet that engenders the torque. The magnitude of
the anomalous Hall torque is sufficiently large to fully negate magnetic
damping of the ferromagnet, which allows us to implement a microwave spin
torque nano-oscillator driven by this torque. The peculiar angular symmetry of
the anomalous Hall torque favors its use over the conventional spin Hall torque
in coupled nano-oscillator arrays. The universal character of the anomalous
Hall torque makes it an integral part of the description of coupled spin
transport and magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures.

<br>
<i>Antoine Borel, Federico Rapisarda, Stephen K. Doorn, Christophe Voisin, Yannick Chassagneux</i>
<p>We report on the photo-luminescence of pairs of organic color centers in
single-wall carbon nanotubes grafted with 3,5 dichlorobenzene. Using various
techniques such as intensity correlations, super-localization microscopy or
luminescence excitation spectroscopy, we distinguish two pairs of color centers
grafted on the same nanotube; the distance between the pairs is on the order of
several hundreds of nanometers. In contrast, by studying the strong temporal
correlations in the spectral diffusion in the framework of photo-induced Stark
effect, we can estimate the distance within each pair to be of the order of a
few nanometers. Finally, the electronic population dynamics is investigated
using time-resolved luminescence and saturation measurements, showing a
biexponential decay with a fast overall recombination (compatible with a fast
population transfer between the color centers within a pair) and a weak delayed
repopulation of the traps possibly due to the diffusion of excitons along the
tube axis.

<p>A current was injected into a single MoS2 nanotube using an
atomic-force-microscopy probe. The trapped electrons and holes caused a partial
collapse of the nanotube and its helical twisting. The topography changes can
be explained by the reverse piezoelectric effect, the theory of which was
proposed for chiral nanostructures. Work-function modifications were observed,
which were dependent on the polarity of the injected carriers.

<i>Marcel Rudolf, Andreas Zumbusch</i>
<p>Colloidal dispersions composed of polymethylmetacrylate particles dispersed
in a mixture of cyclohexylbromide and decalin find widespread use as model
systems in optical microscopy experiments. While the system allows simultaneous
density and refractive index matching, preparing particles with hard potentials
remains challenging and strong variations in the physical parameters of samples
prepared in the same manner are common. Here, we present data on the
measurement of forces between individual pairs of particles over the course of
tens of days using a blinking optical tweezer method. Our results show that the
variations in the particle properties are indeed caused by a temporal evolution
of the particles' charging. Additional measurements of the influence of
tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) addition to the dispersions show that already
small concentrations of added TBAB drastically decrease the electrostatic
forces between colloidal particles. However, small, non-negligible contact
potentials remain even at the highest TBAB concentrations added.

<i>Zhenyu Xiao, Ryuichi Shindou, Kohei Kawabata</i>
<p>Random matrix theory is a powerful tool for understanding spectral
correlations inherent in quantum chaotic systems. Despite diverse applications
of non-Hermitian random matrix theory, the role of symmetry remains to be fully
established. Here, we comprehensively investigate the impact of symmetry on the
level statistics around the spectral origin -- hard-edge statistics -- and
complete the classification of spectral statistics in all the 38 symmetry
classes of non-Hermitian random matrices. Within this classification, we
discern 28 symmetry classes characterized by distinct hard-edge statistics from
the level statistics in the bulk of spectra, which are further categorized into
two groups, namely the Altland-Zirnbauer$_0$ classification and beyond. We
introduce and elucidate quantitative measures capturing the universal hard-edge
statistics for all the symmetry classes. Furthermore, through extensive
numerical calculations, we study various open quantum systems in different
symmetry classes, including quadratic and many-body Lindbladians, as well as
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We show that these systems manifest the same
hard-edge statistics as random matrices and that their ensemble-average
spectral distributions around the origin exhibit emergent symmetry conforming
to the random-matrix behavior. Our results establish a comprehensive
understanding of non-Hermitian random matrix theory and are useful in detecting
quantum chaos or its absence in open quantum systems.

<h3>Lane formation in gravitationally driven colloid mixtures consisting of  up to three different particle sizes</h3>

<br>
<i>Kay Hofmann, Marc Isele, Artur Erbe, Paul Leiderer, Peter Nielaba</i>
<p>Brownian dynamics simulations are utilized to study segregation phenomena far
from thermodynamic equilibrium. In the present study, we expand upon the
analysis of binary colloid mixtures and additionally introduce a third particle
species to further our understanding of colloidal systems. Gravitationally
driven, spherical colloids immersed in an implicit solvent are confined in
two-dimensional linear microchannels. The interaction between the colloids is
modeled by the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential, and the confinement of the
colloids is realized by hard walls based on the solution of the Smoluchowski
equation in half space. In binary and ternary colloidal systems, a difference
in the driving force is achieved by differing colloid sizes, but fixed mass
density. We observe for both the binary and ternary systems that a driving
force difference induces a nonequilibrium phase transition to lanes. For
ternary systems, we study the tendency of lane formation in dependence of the
diameter of the medium-sized colloids. Here, we find a sweetspot for lane
formation in ternary systems. Furthermore, we study the interaction of two
differently sized colloids at the channel walls. Recently, we observed that
driven large colloids push smaller colloids to the walls. This results in small
particle lanes at the walls at early simulation times. In this work, we
additionally find that thin lanes are unstable and dissolve over very long time
frames. Furthermore, we observe a connection between lane formation and the
nonuniform distribution of particles along the channel length. This nonuniform
distribution occurs either alongside lane formation or in shared lanes (i.e.
lanes consisting of two colloid types).

<br>
<i>Filippo De Luca, Ivan Maryshev, Erwin Frey</i>
<p>Active matter systems evade the constraints of thermal equilibrium, leading
to the emergence of intriguing collective behavior. A paradigmatic example is
given by motor-filament mixtures, where the motion of motor proteins drives
alignment and sliding interactions between filaments and their
self-organization into macroscopic structures. After defining a microscopic
model for these systems, we derive continuum equations, exhibiting the
formation of active supramolecular assemblies such as micelles, bilayers and
foams. The transition between these structures is driven by a branching
instability, which destabilizes the orientational order within the micelles,
leading to the growth of bilayers at high microtubule densities. Additionally,
we identify a fingering instability, modulating the shape of the micelle
interface at high motor densities. We study the role of various mechanisms in
these two instabilities, such as contractility, active splay, and anchoring,
allowing for generalization beyond the system considered here.

<i>Simon L. Cornish, Michael R. Tarbutt, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</i>
<p>Ultracold molecules confined in optical lattices or tweezer traps can be used
to process quantum information and simulate the behaviour of many-body quantum
systems. Molecules offer several advantages for these applications. They have a
large set of stable states with strong transitions between them and long
coherence times. They can be prepared in a chosen state with high fidelity, and
the state populations can be measured efficiently. They have controllable
long-range dipole-dipole interactions that can be used to entangle pairs of
molecules and generate interesting many-body states. We review the advances
that have been made and the challenges still to overcome, and describe the new
ideas that will unlock the full potential of the field.

<i>Ruixian Liu, Matthew B. Stone, Shang Gao, Mitsutaka Nakamura, Kazuya Kamazawa, Aleksandra Krajewska, Helen C. Walker, Peng Cheng, Rong Yu, Qimiao Si, Pengcheng Dai, Xingye Lu</i>
<p>The unusual quantum-disordered magnetic ground state intertwined with
superconductivity and electronic nematicity in FeSe has been a research focus
in iron-based superconductors. However, the intrinsic spin excitations across
the entire Brillouin zone in detwinned FeSe, which forms the basis for a
microscopic understanding of the magnetic state and superconductivity, remain
to be determined. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out the spin
excitations of FeSe dewtinned with a uniaxial-strain device. We find that the
stripe spin excitations (Q=(1, 0)/(0, 1)) exhibit the $C_2$ symmetry up to
$E\approx120$ meV, while the N{\'e}el spin excitations (Q=(1, 1)) retain their
$C_4$ symmetry in the nematic state. The temperature dependence of the
difference in the spin excitations at Q=(1, 0) and (0, 1) for temperatures
above the structural phase transition unambiguously shows the establishment of
the nematic quantum disordered state. The similarity of the N\'eel excitations
in FeSe and NaFeAs suggests that the N\'eel excitations are driven by the
enhanced electron correlations in the $3d_{xy}$ orbital. By determining the key
features of the stripe excitations and fitting their dispersions using a
Heisenberg Hamiltonian with biquadratic interaction ($J_1$-$K$-$J_2$), we
establish a spin-interaction phase diagram and conclude that FeSe is close to a
crossover region between the antiferroquadrupolar, N\'eel, and stripe ordering
regimes. The results provide an experimental basis for establishing a
microscopic theoretical model to describe the origin and intertwining of the
emergent orders in iron-based superconductors.

<i>Quentin Gromoff, Patrizio Benzo, Wissam A. Saidi, Christopher M. Andolina, Marie-José Casanove, Teresa Hungria, Sophie Barre, Magali Benoit, Julien Lam</i>
<p>While nanoalloys are of paramount scientific and practical interests, the
main processes leading to their formation are still poorly understood. Key
structural features in the alloy systems, including crystal phase, chemical
ordering, and morphology, are challenging to control at the nanoscale, making
it difficult to transfer their usage to industrial applications. In this
contribution, we focus on the gold/silver system that has two of the most
prevalent noble metals, and combine experiments with simulations to uncover the
formation mechanisms at the atomic-level. Nanoparticles are produced using
state-of-the-art inert-gas aggregation source and analyzed using transmission
electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.
Machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to model
the crystallization process from liquid droplets to nanocrystals. Our study
finds a preponderance of nanoparticles with five-fold symmetric morphology,
including icosahedron and decahedron which is consistent with previous results
on mono-metallic nanoparticles. However, we observe that gold atoms, rather
than silver atoms, segregate at the surface of the obtained nanoparticles for
all the considered alloy compositions. These segregation tendencies are in
contrast to previous studies and have consequences on the crystallization
dynamics and the subsequent crystal ordering. We finally show that the
underpinnings of this surprising segregation dynamics is due to charge transfer
and electrostatic interactions rather than surface energy considerations.

<p>We performed molecular dynamics simulations of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50}$ metallic
glass samples submitted to mechanical deformation at different strain rates.
The simultaneous measurements of the stress-strain curve, and of the
temperature evolution during the cyclic mechanical load, are used to determine
the thermo-mechanical constitutive laws at the continuum scale. It is shown
that plastic deformation acts as a heat source, but strong finite size effects
affect the unfolding of shear bands and its related dissipation rate. Finally,
a thermo-mechanical constitutive law is proposed to reproduce quantitavely
self-heating processes at different scales.

<br>
<i>L. Q. Lai, Z. Li</i>
<p>Collective emission of particles from a parametrically driven condensate has
attracted significant experimental and theoretical attention due to the
appealing visual effects and potential metrological applications. In this
paper, we investigate the particle emission from a Bose-Einstein condensate
confined in a one-dimensional lattice with periodically modulated interparticle
interactions. We give the regimes for discrete modes, and find that the
emission is distinctly suppressed. The configuration induces a broad band, but
due to the interference of the matter waves few particles can be ejected. We
further qualitatively model the emission process, and demonstrate the
short-time behaviors. This engineering provides a way for manipulating the
propagation of particles and the corresponding dynamics of condensates in
lattices, and may find use in other nonequilibrium problems with time-periodic
driving.

<i>Mathias Pacé-Loscos, Deeksha Gupta, Tom Ferté, Matthias Riepp, Gregory Malinowski, Michel Hehn, Federico Pressacco, Matthieu Silly, Fausto Sirotti, Christine Boeglin, Nicolas Bergeard</i>
<p>We have investigated the laser induced ultrafast dynamics of Gd 4f spins at
the surface of CoxGd100-x alloys by means of surface-sensitive and
time-resolved dichroic resonant Auger spectroscopy. We have observed that the
laser induced quenching of Gd 4f magnetic order at the surface of the
CoxGd100-x alloys occur on a much longer time scale than that previously
reported in bulk sensitive time-resolved experiments. In parallel, we have
characterized the static structural and magnetic properties at the surface and
in the bulk of these alloys by combining Physical Property Measurement System
(PPMS) magnetometry with X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism in absorption
spectroscopy (XMCD) and X-Ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The PPMS and
XMCD measurements give information regarding the composition in the bulk of the
alloys. The XPS measurements show non-homogeneous composition at the surface of
the alloys with a strongly increased Gd content within the first layers
compared to the nominal bulk values. Such larger Gd concentration results in a
reduced indirect Gd 4f spin-lattice coupling. It explains the slower Gd 4f
demagnetization we have observed in our surface-sensitive and time-resolved
measurements compared to that previously reported by bulk-sensitive
measurements.

<h3>Directional drying of a colloidal dispersion: quantitative description  with water potential measurements using water clusters in a  poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic chip</h3>

<br>
<i>Hrishikesh Pingulkar, Sonia Maréchal, Jean-Baptiste Salmon</i>
<p>We have developed a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic chip to study
the directional drying of a colloidal dispersion confined in a channel. Our
measurements on a dispersion of silica nanoparticles once again revealed the
phenomenology commonly observed for such systems: the formation of a porous
solid with linear growth in the channel at short times, slowing down at longer
times as the evaporation rate decreases. The growth of the solid is also
accompanied by mechanical stresses that are released by the delamination of the
solid from the channel walls and the formation of cracks. In addition to these
observations, we report original measurements using hydrophilic filler in the
PDMS formulation used (Sylgard-184). When the PDMS matrix is in contact with
water, water molecules pool around these hydrophilic sites, resulting in the
formation of microscopic water clusters whose size depends on the water
potential $\psi$. In our work, we have used these water clusters to estimate
the water potential profile in the channel as the porous solid grows. Using a
transport model that also takes into account solid delamination in the channel,
we then linked these water potential measurements to the hydraulic permeability
of the porous solid. These measurements finally enabled us to show that the
slowdown in the evaporation rate is due to the invasion of the porous solid by
air/water nanomenisci at a critical capillary pressure $\psi_\text{cap}$.

<h3>Current circulation near additional energy degeneracy points in  quadratic Fermionic networks</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05140" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05140</a>
<br>
<i>Vipul Upadhyay, Rahul Marathe</i>
<p>We study heat and particle current circulation (CC) in quadratic fermionic
systems analysed using local Lindblad master equation. It was observed in an
earlier study \cite{Our_circulation} that CC occurs near the additional energy
degeneracy point (AEDP) in fermionic systems which have some form of asymmetry.
We find general analytical expression to support this observation for quadratic
fermionic networks. We then apply these ideas to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
model with periodic boundary conditions and a tight binding model with unequal
hopping strengths in the upper and lower branches. In both these cases, we find
the specific conditions required for observing CC and study the behavior of
these currents with various system parameters. We find that having an unequal
number of fermionic sites in the upper and lower branches is enough for
generating CC in the SSH model. However, this asymmetry is not adequate for the
tight-binding model and we require unequal hopping strengths in the upper and
lower branches to induce CC in this model. Finally, we observe that for certain
system parameters, the onset point of particle and heat CC are not the same.
Based on all these observations, we describe how carefully examining the energy
spectrum of the system gives a great deal of information about the possibility
and behavior of CC in fermionic systems with asymmetries.

<h3>Strictly one dimensional behavior emerging from dispersive two  dimensional system: implications on metallic nanowires on semiconducting  substrates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05147" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05147</a>
<br>
<i>Keshab Sony, Anas Abdelwahab</i>
<p>We studied single and two Su-Shreiffer-Heeger wires on simple cubic
semiconducting substrate. The wire-wire coupling is either perpendicular or
diagonal hopping respecting the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries. The
hybridization to substrate renormalizes the model parameters of the wires
towards the hopping parameter of the substrate without changing the basic
nature of perpendicular or diagonal coupling and it can mediate effective
perpendicular hopping but not diagonal hopping in the absence of direct
wire-wire coupling. This justifies the investigation of multi uniform tight
binding wires with perpendicular or diagonal hopping parameters while
neglecting the substrate. Perpendicularly coupled uniform wires reveal
anisotropic two dimensional band dispersion. Diagonally coupled uniform wires
reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel to the wires direction if the
intra-wire hopping parameter is larger than twice the diagonal hopping
parameter despite strong dispersion perpendicular to the wires. Otherwise, they
reveal strictly one dimensional bands parallel and perpendicular to the wires
direction simultaneously. We established the possibility of realizing strictly
one dimensional properties emerging from dispersive two dimensional system if
time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries are respected. This can facilitate
the investigations of Luttinger liquid in the Au/Ge(001) and Bi/InSb(001)

<h3>Observation of correlation induced metal to half-metal phase transition  and large orbital moment in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05149" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05149</a>
<br>
<i>Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K. Pandey</i>
<p>We present a detailed mean-field study to address the fundamental discrepancy
in the ground state magnetization of $\mathrm{Sr_{2}CoO_{4}}$ (SCO). In
contrast to the ferromagnetic metallic ground state obtained from density
functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$ gives three ferromagnetic solutions converging
to integer moment values (1, 2 \& 3 $\mu_B$/f.u) over a range of $U$.
Interestingly, two of the solutions are found to exhibit half-metallicity with
correspondingly $S$=1/2 and S=3/2 spin states. The half-metallic ferromagnetic
state with $S$=3/2 is found to be the ground state solution for SCO. Co atoms
show a large deviation from the formal +4 oxidation state indicating the
presence of strong covalency effects. Our results suggest a plausible metal to
half-metal phase transition around $U$($J$)=4.4(1.16) eV. The Fermi surface
study shows gradual collapse in states leading to half-metallicity suggesting
\textit{\textbf{k}}-dependence of effective $U$ around the critical region.
Surprisingly, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), unexpectedly large
orbital moment ($L_{z}$=0.6) is noted in SCO putting it among the class of 3$d$
based transition metal compounds exhibiting pronounced orbital magnetization.
The calculations give large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of
$\sim$48 meV. Large values of orbital magnetic moment contribution and MAE, in
the presence of strong correlation effects, provide a better interpretation of
experimental magnetization observed in SCO.

<h3>Disorder-induced enhancement of lithium-ion transport in solid-state  electrolytes</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05151" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05151</a>
<br>
<i>Zhimin Chen, Tao Du, N. M. Anoop Krishnan, Yuanzheng Yue, Morten M. Smedskjaer</i>
<p>Enhancing the ion conduction in solid electrolytes is critically important
for the development of high-performance all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs). Lithium thiophosphates are among the most promising solid electrolytes,
as they exhibit superionic conductivity at room temperature. However, the lack
of comprehensive understanding regarding their ion conduction mechanism,
especially the effect of structural disorder on ionic conductivity, is a
long-standing problem that limits further innovations of all-solid-state LIBs.
Here, we address this challenge by establishing and employing a deep learning
potential to simulate Li3PS4 electrolyte systems with varying levels of
disorder. The results show that disorder-driven diffusion dynamics
significantly enhances the room-temperature conductivity. We further establish
bridges between dynamical characteristics, local structural features, and
atomic rearrangements by applying a machine learning-based structure
fingerprint termed "softness". This metric allows the classification of the
disorder-induced "soft" hopping lithium ions. Our findings offer insights into
ion conduction mechanisms in complex disordered structures, thereby
contributing to the development of superior solid-state electrolytes for LIBs.

<h3>Chaos and quantization of the three-particle generic  Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model I: Density of states and spectral statistics</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05188" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05188</a>
<br>
<i>Hua Yan, Marko Robnik</i>
<p>We study the mixed-type classical dynamics of the three-particle
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model in relationship with its quantum
counterpart, and present new results on aspects of quantum chaos in this
system. First we derive for the general N-particle FPUT system the
transformation to the normal mode representation. Then we specialize to the
three-particle FPUT case, and derive analytically the semiclassical energy
density of states, and its derivatives in which different singularies are
determined, using the Thomas-Fermi rule. The result perfectly agrees with the
numerical energy density from the Krylov subspace method, as well as with the
energy density obtained by the method of quantum typicality. Here, in paper I,
we concentrate on the energy level statistics (level spacing and spacing
ratios), in all classical dynamical regimes of interest: the almost entirely
regular, the entirely chaotic, and the mixed-type regimes. We clearly confirm,
correspondingly, the Poissonian statistics, the GOE statistics, and the
Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) statistics in the mixed-type regime. It is found that
the BRB level spacing distribution perfectly fits the numerical data. The
extracted quantum Berry-Robnik parameter is found to agree with the classical
value within better than one percent. We discuss the role of localization of
chaotic eigenstates, and its appearances, in relation to the classical phase
space structure (Poincar\'e and SALI plots), whose details will be presented in
paper II, where the structure and the statistical properties of the Husimi
functions in the quantum phase space will be studied.

<h3>Insights into elastic properties of coarse-grained DNA models:  q-stiffness of cgDNA vs. cgDNA+</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05208" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05208</a>
<br>
<i>Wout Laeremans, Midas Segers, Aderik Voorspoels, Enrico Carlon, Jef Hooyberghs</i>
<p>Coarse-grained models have emerged as valuable tools to simulate long DNA
molecules while maintaining computational efficiency. These models aim at
preserving interactions among coarse-grained variables in a manner that mirrors
the underlying atomistic description. We explore here a method for testing
coarse-grained vs. all-atom models using stiffness matrices in Fourier space
($q$-stiffnesses), which are particularly suited to probe DNA elasticity at
different length scales. We focus on a class of coarse-grained rigid base DNA
models known as cgDNA and its most recent version cgDNA+. Our analysis shows
that while cgDNA+ follows closely the $q$-stiffnesses of the all-atom model,
the original cgDNA shows some deviations for twist and bending variables which
are rather strong in the $q \to 0$ (long length scale) limit. The consequence
is that while both cgDNA and cgDNA+ give a suitable description of local
elastic behavior, the former misses some effects which manifest themselves at
longer length scales. In particular, cgDNA performs poorly on the twist
stiffness with a value much lower than expected for long DNA molecules.
Conversely, the all-atom and cgDNA+ twist is strongly length scale dependent:
DNA is torsionally soft at a few base pair distances, but becomes more rigid at
distances of a few dozens base pairs. Our analysis shows that the bending
persistence length in all-atom and cgDNA+ is somewhat overestimated.

<h3>The role of the pseudogap in cuprate superconductors revealed by the  Hall effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05213" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05213</a>
<br>
<i>Júlia C. Anjos, Hércules Santana, E. V. L. de Mello</i>
<p>Cuprate high-temperature superconductors are known to have a normal-state
pseudogap but, after many years of intense research, its relation to the
superconductivity is still a mystery. Similarly, the in-plane Hall coefficient
$R_{\rm H}$ has a large temperature variation caused by changes in the carrier
density which is also a long-standing puzzle. We approach both problems by a
kinetic theory of phase separation that reproduces the charge density wave by a
free energy array of potential wells. The charge modulation favors local
hole-hole attraction yielding local superconducting pairs and a transition by
long-range phase order at $T_{\rm c}$. As the temperature increases the
modulations decrease and the charge density increases by thermal activation.
This approach reproduces the $R_{\rm H}$ of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ compounds
of $x = 0.0 - 0.25$ and clarifies the role of the pseudogap and the disorder in
cuprates.

<h3>Physics guided dual Self-supervised learning for structure-based  materials property prediction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05223</a>
<br>
<i>Nihang Fu, Lai Wei, Jianjun Hu</i>
<p>Deep learning (DL) models have now been widely used for high-performance
material property prediction for properties such as formation energy and band
gap. However, training such DL models usually requires a large amount of
labeled data, which is usually not available for most materials properties such
as exfoliation energy and elastic properties. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods have been proposed to address this data scarcity issue by learning
inherent representations from unlabeled data in various research fields.
Herein, we present DSSL, a physics-guided Dual SSL framework, for graph neural
networks (GNNs) based material property prediction. This hybrid framework
combines node-masking based predictive SSL with atomic coordinate perturbation
based contrastive SSL strategies, allowing it to learn structural embeddings
that capture both local and global information of input crystals. Especially,
we propose to use predicting the macroproperty (e.g. elasticity) related
microproperty such as atomic stiffness as an additional pretext task to achieve
physics-guided pretraining process. We pretrain our DSSL model on the Materials
Project database with unlabeled data and finetune it with ten extra datasets
with different material properties. The experimental results demonstrate that
teaching neural networks some physics using the SSL strategy can bring up to
26.89\% performance improvement compared to the baseline GNN models. Our source
code is now freely available at https://github.com/usccolumbia/DSSL

<h3>Escape from textured adsorbing surfaces</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05227" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05227</a>
<br>
<i>Yuval Scher, Shlomi Reuveni, Denis S. Grebenkov</i>
<p>The escape dynamics of sticky particles from textured surfaces is poorly
understood despite importance to various scientific and technological domains.
In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the escape time of
adsorbates from prevalent surface topographies, including holes/pits, pillars,
and grooves. Analytical expressions for the probability density function and
the mean of the escape time are derived. A particularly interesting scenario is
that of very deep and narrow confining spaces within the surface. In this case,
the joint effect of the entrapment and stickiness prolongs the escape time,
resulting in an effective desorption rate that is dramatically lower than that
of the untextured surface. This rate is shown to abide a universal scaling law,
which couples the equilibrium constants of adsorption with the relevant
confining length scales. While our results are analytical and exact, we also
present an approximation for deep and narrow cavities based on an effective
description of one dimensional diffusion that is punctuated by motionless
adsorption events. This simple and physically motivated approximation provides
high-accuracy predictions within its range of validity and works relatively
well even for cavities of intermediate depth. All theoretical results are
corroborated with extensive Monte-Carlo simulations.

<h3>Extreme-value statistics and super-universality in critical percolation?</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05234" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05234</a>
<br>
<i>Mohadeseh Feshanjerdi, Peter Grassberger</i>
<p>Recently, the number of non-standard percolation models has proliferated. In
all these models, there exists a phase transition at which long range
connectivity is established, if local connectedness increases through a
threshold $p_c$. In ordinary (site or bond) percolation on regular lattices,
this is a well understood second-order phase transition with rather precisely
known critical exponents, but there are non-standard models where the
transitions are in different universality classes (i.e. with different
exponents and scaling functions), or even are discontinuous or hybrid. It was
recently claimed that certain scaling functions are in all such models given by
extreme-value theory and thus independent of the precise universality class.
This would lead to super-universality (even encompassing first-order
transitions!) and would be a major break-through in the theory of phase
transitions. We show that this claim is wrong.

<h3>A Novel ES-BGK Model for Non-Polytropic Gases with Internal State  Density Independent of the Temperature</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05260" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05260</a>
<br>
<i>Takashi Arima, Andrea Mentrelli, Tommaso Ruggeri</i>
<p>A novel ES-BGK-based model of non-polytropic rarefied gases in the framework
of kinetic theory is presented. Key features of this model are: an internal
state density function depending only on the microscopic energy of internal
modes (avoiding the dependence on temperature seen in previous reference
studies); full compliance with the H-theorem; feasibility of the closure of the
system of moment equations based on the maximum entropy principle, following
the well-established procedure of Rational Extended Thermodynamics.
The structure of planar shock waves in carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) obtained with
the present model is in general good agreement with that of previous results,
except for the computed internal temperature profile, which is qualitatively
different with respect to the results obtained in previous studies, showing
here a consistently monotonous behavior across the shock structure, rather than
the non monotonous behavior previously found.

<h3>Stability of superfluids in tilted optical lattices with periodic  driving</h3>

<br>
<i>Robbie Cruickshank, Andrea Di Carli, Matthew Mitchell, Arthur La Rooij, Stefan Kuhr, Charles E. Creffield, Elmar Haller</i>
<p>Tilted lattice potentials with periodic driving play a crucial role in the
study of artificial gauge fields and topological phases with ultracold quantum
gases. However, driving-induced heating and the growth of phonon modes restrict
their use for probing interacting many-body states. Here, we experimentally
investigate phonon modes and interaction-driven instabilities of superfluids in
the lowest band of a shaken optical lattice. We identify stable and unstable
parameter regions and provide a general resonance condition. In contrast to the
high-frequency approximation of a Floquet description, we use the superfluids'
micromotion to analyze the growth of phonon modes from slow to fast driving
frequencies. Our observations enable the prediction of stable parameter regimes
for quantum-simulation experiments aimed at studying driven systems with strong
interactions over extended time scales.

<h3>Narrowly avoided spin-nematic phase in BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$: NMR evidence</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05269" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05269</a>
<br>
<i>K. M. Ranjith, K. Yu. Povarov, Z. Yan, A. Zheludev, M. Horvatić</i>
<p>We present a $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigation of
BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$ focusing on the nearly saturated regime between
$\mu_0H_{c1}$ = 4.05 T and $\mu_0H_{c2}$ = 6.5 T, used to be considered as a
promising candidate for a spin-nematic phase. NMR spectra establish the absence
of any dipolar order there, whereas the weak field dependence of the
magnetization above $H_{c1}$ is accounted for by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction terms. The low-energy spin dynamics (fluctuations), measured by
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($T_1^{-1}$), confirms the continuity of
this phase and the absence of any low-temperature phase transition.
Unexpectedly, the spin dynamics above $H_{c1}$ is largely dominated by
two-magnon processes, which is expected above the saturation field of a
spin-nematic phase, but not inside. This shows that BaCdVO(PO$_4$)$_2$ is
indeed close to a spin-nematic instability, however, this phase is not
stabilized. We thus confirm recent theoretical predictions that the
spin-nematic phase can be stabilized, at most, in an extremely narrow field
range close to saturation or is rather narrowly avoided [Jiang et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 130, 116701 (2023)].

<h3>Quantum magnetism in the frustrated square lattice oxyhalides YbBi2IO4  and YbBi2ClO4</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05283" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05283</a>
<br>
<i>Pyeongjae Park, G. Sala, Th. Proffen, Matthew B. Stone, Andrew D. Christianson, Andrew F. May</i>
<p>Square-lattice systems offer a direct route for realizing 2D quantum
magnetism with frustration induced by competing interactions. In this work, the
square-lattice materials YbBi2IO4 and YbBi2ClO4 were investigated using a
combination of magnetization and specific heat measurements on polycrystalline
samples. Specific heat measurements provide evidence for long-range magnetic
order below TN = 0.21 K (0.25 K) for YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4). On the other hand, a
rather broad maximum is found in the temperature-dependent magnetic
susceptibility, located at Tmax = 0.33 K (0.38 K) in YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4),
consistent with the quasi-2D magnetism expected for the large separation
between the magnetic layers. Estimation of the magnetic entropy supports the
expected Kramers' doublet ground state for Yb3+ and the observed paramagnetic
behavior is consistent with a well-isolated doublet. Roughly two-thirds of the
entropy is consumed above TN, due to a combination of the quasi-2D behavior and
magnetic frustration. The impact of frustration is examined from the viewpoint
of a simplified J1-J2 square lattice model, which is frustrated for
antiferromagnetic interactions. Specifically, a high-temperature series
expansion analysis of the temperature-dependent specific heat and magnetization
data yields J2/J1 = 0.30 (0.23) for YbBi2IO4 (YbBi2ClO4). This simplified
analysis suggests strong frustration that should promote significant quantum
fluctuations in these compounds, and thus motivates future work on the static
and dynamic magnetic properties of these materials.

<h3>First-principles predictions of HfO$_2$-based ferroelectric  superlattices</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05288" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05288</a>
<br>
<i>Binayak Mukherjee, Natalya S. Fedorova, Jorge Íñiguez-González</i>
<p>The metastable nature of the ferroelectric phase of HfO$_2$ is a significant
impediment to its industrial application as a functional ferroelectric
material. In fact, no polar phases exist in the bulk phase diagram of HfO$_2$,
which shows a dominant non-polar monoclinic ground state. As a consequence,
ferroelectric orthorhombic HfO$_2$ needs to be kinetically stabilized. Here, we
propose an alternative approach, demonstrating the feasibility of
thermodynamically stabilizing polar HfO$_2$ in superlattices with other simple
oxides. Using the composition and stacking direction of the superlattice as
design parameters, we obtain heterostructures that can be fully polar, fully
antipolar or mixed, with improved thermodynamic stability compared to the
orthorhombic polar HfO$_2$ in bulk form. Our results suggest that combining
HfO$_2$ with an oxide that does not have a monoclinic ground state generally
drives the superlattice away from this non-polar phase, favoring the stability
of the ferroelectric structures that minimize the elastic and electrostatic
penalties. As such, these diverse and tunable superlattices hold promise for
various applications in thin-film ferroelectric devices.

<h3>Assessing the performance of Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si from DFT and SLME  calculations for solar cell applications</h3>

<i>Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey</i>
<p>The present work investigates the performance parameters of low-cost &
nontoxic Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si compounds for photovoltaic (PV) applications
by using density functional theory (DFT) and spectroscopic limited maximum
efficiency (SLME) calculations. For this purpose, a detailed analysis of
electronic and optical properties has been performed by using PBE, PBEsol and
mBJ exchange-correlation functionals. The band-gap for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si)
is found to be in the range of 0.25-0.6 (0.57-0.96) eV with an indirect (a
direct) in nature. Moreover, the density of state effective mass at top of the
valence and bottom of the conduction band is obtained to be in the range of
0.14-0.17 (1.17-1.25)m$_{e}$ and 0.27-0.29 (0.3-0.41)m$_{e}$, respectively. The
real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function show a sharp maximum of
magnitude $\sim$40 (15.6) at $\sim$2.6 (0.7) eV and $\sim$47 (14) at $\sim$2.7
(2.6) eV, respectively. Further, the highest absorption coefficient in the
solar spectrum active region is found to be $\sim$1.45 (0.8) $\times$$10^{6}$
$cm^{-1}$. The SLME with respect to the depletion width (W$_{0}$) of an ideal
single-junctional solar cell is estimated. The highest SLME at 300 K is
obtained to be $\sim$3.89 (31.21)%. The required concentrations of acceptor and
donor atoms to achieve this SLME are $\sim$10$^{18}$ $cm^{-3}$ and $\sim$0.45
(0.12) $\times 10^{16}$ $cm^{-3}$, respectively, which corresponds to a W$_{0}$
of $\sim$0.42 (0.84) $\mu m$. The present study suggests that Ca$_{2}$Si
(Mg$_{2}$Si) is a potential candidate for single-junction (bottom cell in
multi-junction) thin-film solar devices.

<br>
<i>Paul Secular</i>
<p>In [Nat. Phys. 8, 325-330 (2012)], Trotzky et al. utilize ultracold atoms in
an optical lattice to simulate the local relaxation dynamics of a strongly
interacting Bose gas "for longer times than present classical algorithms can
keep track of". Here, I classically verify the results of this analog quantum
simulator by calculating the evolution of the same quasi-local observables up
to the time at which they appear "fully relaxed". Using a parallel
implementation of the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to
simulate the system on a supercomputer, I show that local densities and
currents can be calculated in a matter of days rather than weeks. The precision
of these numerics allows me to observe deviations from the conjectured
power-law decay and to determine the effects of the harmonic trapping
potential. As well as providing a robust benchmark for future experimental,
theoretical, and numerical methods, this work serves as an example of the
independent verification process.

<br>
<i>Ana Carpio, Elena Cebrian, David R. Espeso, Perfecto Vidal</i>
<p>From multicellular tissues to bacterial colonies, three dimensional cellular
structures arise through the interaction of cellular activities and mechanical
forces. Simple bacterial communities provide model systems for analyzing such
interaction. Biofilms are bacterial aggregates attached to wet surfaces and
encased in a self-produced polymeric matrix. Biofilms in flows form filamentary
structures that contrast with the wrinkled layers observed on air/solid
interfaces. We are able to reproduce both types of shapes through elastic rod
and plate models that incorporate information from the biomass production and
differentiations process, such as growth rates, growth tensors or inner
stresses, as well as constraints imposed by the interaction with environment. A
more precise study of biofilm dynamics requires tackling water absorption from
its surroundings and fluid transport within the biological system. This process
alters the material properties of the biofilm and the overall stresses. We
analyze whether poroelastic approaches can provide a suitable combined
description of fluid-like and solid-like biofilm behavior.

<h3>Fermi polaron in atom-ion hybrid systems</h3>

<br>
<i>Renato Pessoa, S. A Vitiello, L. A Peña Ardila</i>
<p>Charged quasiparticles dressed by the low excitations of an electron gas,
constitute one of the fundamental pillars for understanding quantum many-body
effects in some materials. Quantum simulation of quasiparticles arising from
atom-ion hybrid systems may shed light on solid-state uncharted regimes. Here
we investigate the ionic Fermi polaron consisting of a charged impurity
interacting with a polarized Fermi bath. Employing state-of-the-art quantum
Monte Carlo techniques tailored for strongly correlated systems, we
characterize the charged quasiparticle by computing the energy spectrum,
quasiparticle residue, and effective mass, as well as the structural properties
of the system. Our findings in the weak coupling regime agree with field-theory
predictions within the ladder approximation. However, stark deviations emerge
in the strongly interacting regime attributed to the vastly large density
inhomogeneity around the ion, resulting in strong correlations for distances on
the order of the atom-ion potential range. Moreover, we find a smooth
polaron-molecule transition for strong coupling, in contrast with the neutral
case, where the transition smoothens only for finite temperature and finite
impurity density. This study may provide valuable insights into alternative
solid-state systems such as Fermi excitons polarons in atomically thin
semiconductors beyond the short-range limit.

<i>Jim Skulte, Phatthamon Kongkhambut, Hans Keßler, Andreas Hemmerich, Ludwig Mathey, Jayson G. Cosme</i>
<p>We propose a general mechanism for generating limit cycle (LC) oscillations
by coupling a linear bosonic mode to a dissipative nonlinear bosonic mode. By
analyzing the stability matrix, we show that LCs arise due to a supercritical
Hopf bifurcation. We find that the existence of LCs is independent of the sign
of the effective nonlinear interaction. The LC phase can be classified as a
continuous time crystal (CTC), if it emerges in a many-body system. The bosonic
model can be realised in three-level systems interacting with a quantised light
mode as realised in atom-cavity systems. Using such a platform, we
experimentally observe LCs for the first time in an atom-cavity system with
attractive optical pump lattice, thereby confirming our theoretical
predictions.
