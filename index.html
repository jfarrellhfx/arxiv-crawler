<h3>Complex flow profiles in microscopic active crystals</h3>

<p>Active solids emerge from self-actuating components interacting with each
other to form crystalline patterns. In equilibrium, commensurability underpins
our understanding of nanoscale friction and particle-level dynamics of
crystals. However, these concepts have yet to be imported into the realm of
active matter. Here, we develop an experimental platform and a theoretical
description for microscopic clusters composed of active particles confined and
self-assembled into small crystals. In our experiments, these crystallites form
upon circular confinement of active rollers, with a magic number of 61 rollers
per well. Competition between solidity and self propulsion leads to self
shearing and complex flow inversion behaviour, along with self sliding states
and activity induced melting. We discover active stick slip dynamics, which
periodically switch between a commensurate static state and an incommensurate
self-sliding state characterised by a train of localised defects. We describe
the steady state behaviour using a discretised model of active hydrodynamics.
We then quantify the intermittent stick slip dynamics using a self-propelled
extension of the Frenkel Kontorova (FK) model, a fundamental workhorse of
slipping and flow in crystals. Our findings in a colloidal model system point
to a wealth of phenomena in incommensurate active solids as design principles
for both assembly and robotics down to the nanoscale.

<h3>Motion of microswimmers in cylindrical microchannels</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04525" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04525</a>
<br>
<i>Florian A. Overberg, Gerhard Gompper, Dmitry A. Fedosov</i>
<p>Biological and artificial microswimmers often have to propel through a
variety of environments, ranging from heterogeneous suspending media to strong
geometrical confinement. Under confinement, local flow fields generated by
microswimmers, and steric and hydrodynamic interactions with their environment
determine the locomotion. We propose a squirmer-like model to describe the
motion of microswimmers in cylindrical microchannels, where propulsion is
generated by a fixed surface slip velocity. The model is studied analytically
for cylindrical swimmer shapes, and by numerical hydrodynamics simulations for
spherical and spheroidal shapes. For the numerical simulations, we employ the
dissipative particle dynamics method for modelling fluid flow. Both the
analytical model and simulations show that the propulsion force increases with
increasing confinement. However, the swimming velocity under confinement
remains lower than the swimmer speed without confinement for all investigated
conditions. In simulations, different swimming modes (i.e. pusher, neutral,
puller) are investigated, and found to play a significant role in the
generation of propulsion force when a swimmer approaches a dead end of a
capillary. Propulsion generation in confined systems is local, such that the
generated flow field generally vanishes beyond the characteristic size of the
swimmer. These results contribute to a better understanding of microswimmer
force generation and propulsion under strong confinement, including the motion
in porous media and in narrow channels.

<h3>Stringlet Excitation Model of the Boson Peak</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04230" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04230</a>
<br>
<i>Cunyuan Jiang, Matteo Baggioli, Jack F. Douglas</i>
<p>The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states
over the phonon Debye contribution, is often identified as being a
characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its
microscopic origin still remains a mystery and a consensus on its theoretical
derivation has not yet been achieved. Recently, it has been proposed, and
corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized
modes which involve string-like excitations ("stringlets") having a
one-dimensional (1D) nature. In this work, we build on a theoretical framework
originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating
strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as
observed in independent simulation studies. We show that a generalization of
this framework provides an analytical prediction for the BP frequency
$\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the glass transition
temperature in both 2D and 3D amorphous systems. The final result involves no
free parameters and is in quantitative agreement with prior simulation
observations. Additionally, this stringlet theory of the BP naturally
reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an
analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear
modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of
glass-forming liquids, which are normally performed above the glass-transition
temperature, $T_g$. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence
of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large
low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in
both experiments and simulations.

<h3>Magnetic functionalization and Catalytic behavior of magnetic  nanoparticles during laser photochemical graphitization of polyimide</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04264" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04264</a>
<br>
<i>Abhishek Sarkar, Ho-won Noh, Ikenna Nlebedim, Prana Shrotriya</i>
<p>We report laser-assisted photochemical graphitization of polyimides (PI) into
functional magnetic nanocomposites using laser irradiation of PI in the
presence of magnetite nanoparticles (MNP). PI Kapton sheets covered with MNP
were photochemically treated under ambient conditions using a picosecond pulsed
laser (1064nm) to obtain an electrically conductive material. Scanning electron
microscopy of the treated material revealed layered magnetic
nanoparticles/graphite nanocomposite structure (MNP/graphite). Four probe
conductivity measurements indicated that nanocomposite has an electrical
conductivity of 1550 S/m. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer-based magnetic characterization of the treated material revealed
an anisotropic ferromagnetic response in the MNP/graphite nanocomposite
compared to the isotropic response of MNP. Raman spectroscopy of MNP/graphite
nanocomposite revealed a four-fold improvement in graphitization, suppression
in disorder, and decreased nitrogenous impurities compared to the graphitic
material obtained from laser treatment of just PI sheets. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were
used to delineate the phase transformations of MNP during the formation of
MNP/graphite nanocomposite. Post-mortem characterization indicates a possible
photocatalytic effect of MNP during MNP/graphite nanocomposite formation. Under
laser irradiation, MNP transformed from the initial Fe3O4 phase to
{\gamma}-Fe2O3 and Fe5C2 phases and acted as nucleation spots to catalyze the
graphitization process of PI.

<h3>Reentrant supersolidity</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04266" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04266</a>
<br>
<i>Leo Radzihovsky</i>
<p>A "supersolid" -- a crystal that exhibits an off-diagonal long-range order
and a superflow -- has been a subject of much research since its first proposal
[Andreev and Lifshitz 1969], but has not been realized as a ground state of
short-range interacting bosons in a continuum. In this note I point out a
simple and generic mechanism for a thermally-driven reentrant supersolidity,
and discuss challenges of experimental realization of this idea. In the limit
of bosons in a periodic potential, this mechanism reduces to a {\em reentrant}
low-temperature normal-superfluid transition, that should be accessible to
simulations and in current experiments on bosonic atoms in an optical periodic
potential.

<h3>A pseudofermion functional renormalization group study of  dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04269" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04269</a>
<br>
<i>Li Ern Chern, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim, Claudio Castelnovo</i>
<p>Motivated by recent experiments on Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ that reveal a dynamic,
liquid-like ground state, we study the nearest neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian of
dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets with the pseudofermion functional
renormalization group (PFFRG), which is numerically implemented by the
SpinParser software. Taking the interaction between the octupolar components to
be dominant and antiferromagnetic, we map out the phase diagram demarcating the
quantum disordered and magnetically ordered states. We identify four distinct
phases, namely the $0$-flux and $\pi$-flux quantum spin ices, and the
all-in-all-out magnetic orders along the local $z$ and $x$ axes. We further use
the static two-spin correlations output by the PFFRG algorithm to compute the
polarized neutron scattering cross-sections, which are able to capture several
qualitative features observed experimentally, in the materially relevant
parameter regime that stabilizes the $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice. Our results
provide support for a quantum spin liquid ground state in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.

<h3>Revealing the ultra-fast domain wall motion in Manganese Gold through  permalloy capping</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04305" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04305</a>
<br>
<i>Sarah Jenkins, Tobias Wagner, Olena Gomonay, Karin Everschor-Sitte</i>
<p>Antiferromagnets offer much faster dynamics compared to their ferromagnetic
counterparts but their order parameter is extremely difficult to detect and
control. So far, controlling the N\'eel order parameter electrically is limited
to only very few materials where N\'eel spin-orbit torques are allowed by
symmetry. In this work, we show that coupling a thin ferromagnet (permalloy)
layer on top of an antiferromagnet (Mn$_2$Au) solves a major roadblock -- the
controlled reading, writing, and manipulation of antiferromagnetic domains. We
confirm by atomistic spin dynamics simulations that the domain wall patterns in
the Mn$_2$Au are imprinted on the permalloy, therefore allowing for indirect
imaging of the N\'eel order parameter. Our simulations show that the coupled
domain wall structures in Mn$_2$Au-Py bilayers can be manipulated by either
acting on the N\'eel order parameter via N\'eel spin-orbit torques or by acting
on the magnetisation (the ferromagnetic order parameter) via magnetic fields.
In both cases, we predict ultra-high domain wall speeds on the order of 8.5
km/s. Thus, employing a thin ferromagnetic layer has the potential to easily
control the N\'eel order parameter in antiferromagnets even where N\'eel
spin-orbit torques are forbidden by symmetry. The controlled manipulation of
the antiferromagnetic order parameter provides a promising basis for the
development of high-density storage and efficient computing technologies
working in the THz regime.

<h3>The Pressure-Stabilized Polymorph of Indium Triiodide</h3>

<i>Danrui Ni, Haozhe Wang, Xianghan Xu, Weiwei Xie, Robert J. Cava</i>
<p>A layered rhombohedral polymorph of indium (III) triiodide is synthesized at
high pressure and temperature. The unit cell symmetry and approximate
dimensions are determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Its R-3 crystal
structure, with a = 7.217 {\AA}, and c = 20.476 {\AA}, is refined by the
Rietveld method on powder X-ray diffraction data. The crystal structure is
based on InI6 octahedra sharing edges to form honeycomb lattice layers, though
with considerable stacking variations. Different from ambient pressure InI3,
which has a monoclinic molecular structure and a light-yellow color, high
pressure InI3 is layered and has an orange color. The band gaps of both the
monoclinic and rhombohedral variants of InI3 are estimated from diffuse
reflectance measurements.

<h3>Hydrodynamics of Borromean Counterfluids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04340" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04340</a>
<br>
<i>Egor Babaev, Boris Svistunov</i>
<p>Counterflow superfluidity in a system with $N\geq 3$ components is
distinctively different from the $N=2$ case. The key feature is the difference
between the number ($N$) of elementary vortex excitations and the number
($N-1$) of independent branches of phonon modes, that is, the number of
superfluid modes is larger than the number of ordered phase variables. We show
how all the dynamical and statistical aspects of this ("Borromean") type of
ordering are naturally described by effective $N$-component theory featuring
compact-gauge invariance.

<h3>Machine learning of a density functional for anisotropic patchy  particles</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04358" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04358</a>
<br>
<i>Alessandro Simon, Jens Weimar, Georg Martius, Martin Oettel</i>
<p>Anisotropic patchy particles have become an archetypical statistical model
system for associating fluids. Here we formulate an approach to the
Kern-Frenkel model via classical density functional theory to describe the
positionally and orientationally resolved equilibrium density distributions in
flat wall geometries. The density functional is split into a reference part for
the orientationally averaged density and an orientational part in mean-field
approximation. To bring the orientational part into a kernel form suitable for
machine learning techniques, an expansion into orientational invariants and the
proper incorporation of single-particle symmetries is formulated. The
mean-field kernel is constructed via machine learning on the basis of hard wall
simulation data. Results are compared to the well-known random-phase
approximation which strongly underestimates the orientational correlations
close to the wall. Successes and shortcomings of the mean-field treatment of
the orientational part are highlighted and perspectives are given for attaining
a full density functional via machine learning.

Scheme for conversion of quantum information from eigenenergy qubits to

<h3>Patterning edge-like defects and tuning defective areas on the basal  plane of ultra-large MoS$_{2}$ monolayers toward hydrogen evolution reaction</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04413" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04413</a>
<br>
<i>Bianca Rocha Florindo, Leonardo H. Hasimoto, Nicolli de Freitas, Graziâni Candiotto, Erika Nascimento Lima, Cláudia de Lourenço, Ana B. S. de Araujo, Carlos Ospina, Jefferson Bettini, Edson R. Leite, Renato S. Lima, Adalberto Fazzio, Rodrigo B. Capaz, Murilo Santhiago</i>
<p>The catalytic sites of MoS$_{2}$ monolayers towards hydrogen evolution are
well known to be vacancies and edge-like defects. However, it is still very
challenging to control the position, size, and defective areas on the basal
plane of Mo$S_{2}$ monolayers by most of defect-engineering routes. In this
work, the fabrication of etched arrays on ultra-large supported and
free-standing MoS$_{2}$ monolayers using focused ion beam (FIB) is reported for
the first time. By tuning the Ga+ ion dose, it is possible to confine defects
near the etched edges or spread them over ultra-large areas on the basal plane.
The electrocatalytic activity of the arrays toward hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) was measured by fabricating microelectrodes using a new method that
preserves the catalytic sites. We demonstrate that the overpotential can be
decreased up to 290 mV by assessing electrochemical activity only at the basal
plane. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images obtained on FIB
patterned freestanding MoS$_{2}$ monolayers reveal the presence of amorphous
regions and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates sulfur excess in these
regions. Density-functional theory calculations provide identification of
catalytic defect sites. Our results demonstrate a new rational control of
amorphous-crystalline surface boundaries and future insight for defect
optimization in MoS$_{2}$ monolayers.

<h3>AI-accelerated Discovery of Altermagnetic Materials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04418" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04418</a>
<br>
<i>Ze-Feng Gao, Shuai Qu, Bocheng Zeng, Ji-Rong Wen, Hao Sun, Pengjie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu</i>
<p>Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and
experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many
exotic physical properties, the very limited availability of known
altermagnetic materials~(e.g., 14 confirmed materials) hinders the study of
such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials is
crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus
facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies,
e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Here, we report 25 new
altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators,
discovered by an AI search engine unifying symmetry analysis, graph neural
network pre-training, optimal transport theory, and first-principles electronic
structure calculation. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics
reveals that various innovative physical properties manifest in these newly
discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr
effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 8 $i$-wave
altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine
performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic
materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated
discovery of altermagnetic materials.

<h3>Structural and Dynamical Changes in a Gd-Co Metallic Glass by Cryogenic  Rejuvenation</h3>

<p>To experimentally clarify the changes in structural and dynamic
heterogeneities in a metallic glass (MG), Gd65Co35, by rejuvenation with a
temperature cycling (cryogenic rejuvenation), high-energy x-ray diffraction
(HEXRD), anomalous x-ray scattering (AXS), and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS)
experiments were carried out. By a repeated temperature change between liquid
N2 and room temperatures 40 times, tiny but clear structural changes are
observed by HEXRD even in the first neighboring range. Partial structural
information obtained by AXS reveals that slight movements of the Gd and Co
atoms occur in the first- and second-neighboring shells around the central Gd
atom. The concentration inhomogeneity in the nm size drastically increases for
the Gd atoms by the temperature cycling, while the other heterogeneities are
negligible. A distinct change was detected in a microscopic elastic property by
IXS: The width of longitudinal acoustic excitation broadens by about 20%,
indicating an increase of the elastic heterogeneity of this MG by the thermal
treatments. These static and dynamic results explicitly clarify the features of
the cryogenic rejuvenation effect experimentally.

<i>Hayun Park, Hunpyo Lee</i>
<p>We developed a semiclassical approximation method in combination with an
adaptive moment estimation optimizer (SCA + ADAM) approach based on the PyTorch
plus CUDA library on a the graphics processing unit (GPU). This method was
employed to evaluate one-particle properties of the Hubbard model with
long-range spatial correlations within an appropriate computing duration. The
method was applied to the ionic Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square
lattice with long-range spatial correlations. The computation time was
evaluated as a function of the lattice size on the central processing unit and
GPU. Herein, we also discuss the density of states and antiferromagnetic (AF)
order parameter in the Hubbard model without the ionic potential and compare
the results with those of the Hartree-Fock approximation. Finally, we present
the one-particle properties and order parameter in charge density wave, AF
metal and AF insulator of the ionic Hubbard model.

<h3>Fano Andreev effect in a T shaped Double Quantum Dot in the Coulomb  blockade regime</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04445" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04445</a>
<br>
<i>A. González I., A. M. Calle, M. Pacheco, E. C. Siqueira, Pedro A. Orellana</i>
<p>We studied the effects of superconducting quantum correlations in a system
consisting of two quantum dots, two normal leads, and a superconductor. Using
the non-equilibrium Green's functions method, we analyzed the transmission,
density of states, and differential conductance of electrons between the normal
leads. We found that the superconducting correlations resulted in Fano-Andreev
interference, which is characterized by two anti-resonance line shapes in all
of these quantities. This behavior was observed in both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium regimes and persisted even when Coulomb correlations were taken
into account using the Hubbard-I approximation. It is worth noting that the
robustness of this behavior against these conditions has not been studied
previously in the literature.

<h3>Nanorod size dependence of coherent coupling between individual and  collective excitations via transverse electromagnetic field</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04460" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04460</a>
<br>
<i>Masayuki Iio, Tomohiro Yokoyama, Takeshi Inaoka, Hajime Ishihara</i>
<p>Plasmon is a collective excitation in metals formed through the Coulomb
interaction between individual excitations of electron-hole pairs. In many
previous studies on the plasmonic response, the role of the longitudinal field
has been focused almost exclusively on the light-induced plasmonic phenomena,
e.g., hot-carrier generation. In our previous study [Phys. Rev. B 105, 165408
(2022)], we have revealed the significant contribution of the transverse
electromagnetic field to connect plasmons and electron-hole pairs in
nanostructures based on the self-consistent and nonlocal response theory. In
this study, we examine how this contribution appears depending on the system
parameters, e.g., length and refractive index. The elucidation of roles of
coherent coupling between the collective and individual excitations by the
transverse field will lead to the principle of controlling bidirectional energy
transfer between the plasmons and electron-hole pairs, which could
significantly enhance hot-carrier generation efficiency.

<h3>Hydrogen diffusion in the lower mantle revealed by machine learning  potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04461" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04461</a>
<br>
<i>Yihang Peng, Jie Deng</i>
<p>Hydrogen may be incorporated into nominally anhydrous minerals including
bridgmanite and post-perovskite as defects, making the Earth's deep mantle a
potentially significant water reservoir. The diffusion of hydrogen and its
contribution to the electrical conductivity in the lower mantle are rarely
explored and remain largely unconstrained. Here we calculate hydrogen
diffusivity in hydrous bridgmanite and post-perovskite, using molecular
dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials of ab initio
quality. Our findings reveal that hydrogen diffusivity significantly increases
with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure, and is considerably
sensitive to hydrogen incorporation mechanism. Among the four defect mechanisms
examined, (Mg + 2H)$_{\rm Si}$ and (Al + H)$_{\rm Si}$ show similar patterns
and yield the highest hydrogen diffusivity. Hydrogen diffusion is generally
faster in post-perovskite than in bridgmanite, and these two phases exhibit
distinct diffusion anisotropies. Overall, hydrogen diffusion is slow on
geological time scales and may result in heterogeneous water distribution in
the lower mantle. Additionally, the proton conductivity of bridgmanite for (Mg
+ 2H)$_{\rm Si}$ and (Al + H)$_{\rm Si}$ defects aligns with the same order of
magnitude of lower mantle conductivity, suggesting that the water distribution
in the lower mantle may be inferred by examining the heterogeneity of
electrical conductivity.

<h3>Kekulé valence bond order in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb  lattice with possible lattice distortions for graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04469" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04469</a>
<br>
<i>Yuichi Otsuka, Seiji Yunoki</i>
<p>We investigate if and how the valence-bond-solid (VBS) state emerges in the
Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice when the Peierls-type electron-lattice
coupling is introduced. We consider all possible lattice-distortion patterns
allowed for this lattice model for graphene which preserve the reflection
symmetry and determine the most stable configuration in the adiabatic limit by
using an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo method. The VBS phase with Kekul\'e
dimerization is found to appear as an intermediate phase between a semimetal
and an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator for a moderately rigid lattice. This
implies that the undistorted semimetallic graphene can be driven into the VBS
phase by applying strain, accompanied by the single-particle excitation gap
opening.

<p>Orientation, structure and morphology in the early growth stages of CuO films
on strontium titanate were studied by synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction.
Nanostructured CuO films were obtained by ex situ heat treatment at 970 K in
oxygen flow at ambient pressure after an initial deposition of Cu on
SrTiO$_3$(001) at $10^{-4}$ Pa oxygen pressure using the molecular beam epitaxy
technique. These films at low coverages grow forming islands a few tens of
nanometers wide, with the [010] direction perpendicular to the substrate
surface. Two types of epitaxies are observed, CuO[001]//SrTiO$_3$[100] and
CuO[100]//SrTiO$_3$[100], the former being the preferred one. The combination
of these epitaxies with the P4mm surface symmetry of the substrate generates 16
different orientations of nanostructures. The lattice constant values obtained
from X-ray diffraction are very close to those of bulk tenorite, with the
exception of the monoclinic angle $\theta$, which is reduced from 99.54$^\circ$
to 96.76(8)$^\circ$ by the epitaxy constraints. This angle is a key parameter
in determining the magnetic properties of CuO.

<h3>Minimal Surfaces & the Intermediate State of Type-I Superconductors</h3>

<br>
<i>Pavol Valko, Thomas A. Girard</i>
<p>The geometry of the intermediate state (IS) flux structures of type-I
superconductors, observed during early stages of magnetic flux penetration
induced by an externally applied perpendicular magnetic field, is approached in
terms of minimal surfaces. This approach follows from the assumption that a
local free energy minimization constraint, for each individual flux structure,
dominates for sufficiently spatially separated magnetic flux regions, i.e. when
over global free energy minimization predicts very low periodicity of sample
intermediate state.

<br>
<i>Gang Jiang, Z. Y. Chen, S. J. Yue, W. B. Rui, Xiao-Ming Zhu, Shengyuan A. Yang, Y. X. Zhao</i>
<p>In the field of symmetry-protected topological phases, a common wisdom is
that the symmetries fix the topological classifications, but they alone cannot
determine whether a system is topologically trivial or not. Here, we show that
this is no longer true in cases where symmetries are projectively represented.
Particularly, the Zak phase, a topological invariant of a one-dimensional
system, can be entirely determined by the projective symmetry algebra (PSA). To
demonstrate this remarkable effect, we propose a minimal model, termed as flux
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, where the bond dimerization in the original
SSH model is replaced by a flux dimerization. We present experimental
realization of our flux SSH model in an electric-circuit array, and our
predictions are directly confirmed by experimental measurement. Our work
refreshes the understanding of the relation between symmetry and topology,
opens up new avenues for exploring PSA determined topological phases, and
suggests flux dimerization as a novel approach for designing topological
crystals.

<h3>Active search for a reactive target in thermal environments</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04539" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04539</a>
<br>
<i>Byeong Guk Go, Euijin Jeon, Yong Woon Kim</i>
<p>We study a stochastic process where an active particle, modeled by a
one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle, searches for a target with a finite
absorption strength in thermal environments. Solving the Fokker-Planck equation
for a uniform initial distribution, we analytically calculate the mean
searching time (MST), the time for the active particle to be finally absorbed,
and show that there exists an optimal self-propulsion velocity of the active
particle at which MST is minimized. As the diffusion constant increases, the
optimal velocity changes from a finite value to zero, which implies that a
purely diffusive Brownian motion outperforms an active motion in terms of
searching time. Depending on the absorption strength of the target, the
transition of the optimal velocity becomes either continuous or discontinuous,
which can be understood based on the Landau approach. In addition, we obtain
the phase diagram indicating the passive-efficient and the active-efficient
regions. Finally, the initial condition dependence of MST is presented in
limiting cases.

<h3>Determining the molecular Huang-Rhys factor via STM induced luminescence</h3>

<br>
<i>Fei Wen, Guohui Dong</i>
<p>The scanning tunneling microscopy induced luminescence (STML) can be used to
probe the optical and electronic properties of molecules. Concerning the
vibronic coupling, we model the molecule as a two-level system with the
vibrational degrees of freedom. Based on the Bardeen's theory, we express the
inelastic tunneling current in terms of Huang-Rhys factor within the inelastic
electron scattering (IES) mechanism. We find that the differential conductance,
varying with the bias voltage, exhibits distinct step structure with various
vibronic coupling strength. The second derivative of the inelastic tunneling
current with respect to the bias voltage shows the characteristics of
vibrational-level structure with Franck-Condon factor. Consequently, we propose
a method to determine the Huang-Rhys factor of molecules, holding promising
potential within the realm of solid-state physics.

<h3>Geometric and bond frustration in transverse field Ising clusters</h3>

<br>
<i>Abhiraj Jalagekar</i>
<p>The Ising model, often seen as the paradigmatic spin model, has been heavily
studied for its mathematical description of ferromagnetism in statistical
mechanics. We explore a quantum version of this model, the transverse field
Ising model, and investigate how the quantum property of magnetization
fluctuates with geometrical frustration, a phenomenon arising from the geometry
of a spin system's ground state. We introduce a general measure for frustration
and then implement a computational model built in Python that translates spin
lattices into adjacency matrices, solves the spectrum of the transverse field
Ising model, calculates the expected magnetization of the ground state, plots
the variable over randomly generated spin systems with controllable degrees of
geometrical frustration, and compares the evolution of these plots over an
increasing transverse field. Our finite-size studies exhibit an expected
decrease in magnetization with increasing frustration and suggest the
possibility of robust phases in the large N limit over finite ranges of
frustration, which may be precursors to spin liquids or spin glasses.

<h3>Photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04565" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04565</a>
<br>
<i>Disha Arora, Deepanshu Aggarwal, Sankalpa Ghosh, Rohit Narula</i>
<p>We investigate one- and two-photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene
(TBLG) by examining the effects of tuning the twist angle $ \theta $ and the
excitation energy $ E_l $ on their corresponding absorption coefficients $
\alpha_{i=1,2}$. We find that $ \alpha_1 $ shows distinct peaks as a function
of $ E_l $ which correspond to the van Hove singularities (vHS) of TBLG. In
contrast to single- (SLG) and AB bilayer graphene (BLG), $ \alpha_1 $ is
substantially enhanced by $\sim 2$ and $\sim 1$ orders of magnitude,
respectively, in the visible range. On the other hand, $\alpha_2 $ exhibits a
remarkable increase of $\sim 11$ and $\sim 9$ orders of magnitude.
Interestingly, as $\theta$ increases, the resonant features exhibited by
$\alpha_{i=1,2}$ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ shift progressively from the infrared to
the visible. On doping TBLG, both $\alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $ remain
essentially unchanged \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ but with a minor red-shift in their
resonant peaks. Additionally, we explore various polarization configurations
for TPA and determine the conditions under which $\alpha_2$ becomes extremal.

<h3>Polymorphism of two-dimensional antiferromagnets, AgF2 and CuF2</h3>

<br>
<i>Daniel Jezierski, Wojciech Grochala</i>
<p>We present theoretical study of relative stability as well as of the magnetic
and electronic properties of AgF2 and CuF2, in two related structural forms:
orthorhombic (ambient pressure form of AgF2) and monoclinic (ambient pressure
form of CuF2), using Density Functional Theory. We show, that at P21/c --> Pbca
structural transition is associated with weakening of intra-sheet magnetic
superexchange. This finding is consistent with the flattening of 2D layers,
smaller charge-transfer energy and stronger admixing of Agd/Cud-Fp states in
monoclinic structure, comparing to orthorhombic form. Consequently, monoclinic
AgF2 should be targeted in experiment as it should show stronger magnetic
coupling than its orthorhombic sibling. The dynamically stable P21/c form of
AgF2 could be achieved via two alternative paths: by applied negative strain,
or by rapid quenching silver(II) difluoride from temperatures higher than 480 K
to low temperatures.

<h3>Structure and polymerization of liquid sulfur across the  $λ$-transition</h3>

<br>
<i>Manyi Yang, Enrico Trizio, Michele Parrinello</i>
<p>The anomalous $\lambda$-transition of liquid sulfur, which is supposed to be
related to the transformation of eight-membered sulfur rings into long
polymeric chains, has attracted considerable attention. However, a detailed
description of the underlying dynamical polymerization process is still
missing. Here, we study the structures and the mechanism of the polymerization
processes of liquid sulfur across the $\lambda$-transition as well as its
reverse process of formation of the rings. We do so by performing
ab-initio-quality molecular dynamics simulations thanks to a combination of
machine learning potentials and state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques.
With our approach, we obtain structural results that are in good agreement with
the experiments and we report precious dynamical insights into the mechanisms
involved in the process.

<h3>Stochastic model for transfer of gaseous particles in polymer/CNT  nanocomposites with interfacial regions</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04576" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04576</a>
<br>
<i>Polina Kalashnikova, Ilia Kalashnikov, Konstantin Khromov</i>
<p>In this work a stochastic model of gaseous transfer in polymer/CNT
nanocomposites is presented. The model takes into account interfacial areas,
i.e. polymer depletion regions. The local regime of transport is controlled by
the density of the polymer. In a dense polymer, this regime corresponds to the
ordinary diffusion, while in free volume regions it corresponds to the
ballistic transport. The introduction of a free volume and/or a depleted
polymer layer near to a CNT wall, leads to the emergence of anomalous
diffusion. We have demonstrated how the anomalous diffusion regime changes in
the presence of nanotubes for different distributions of polymer density. The
presented approach allows us to describe the threshold effect in the diffusion
coefficient as a function of CNTs density in polymer/CNT nanocomposites.

<p>In this article we outline the historical development and key results
obtained to date for free parafermionic spin chains. The concept of free
parafermions provides a natural N-state generalization of free fermions, which
have long underpinned the exact solution and application of widely studied
quantum spin chains and their classical counterparts. In particular, we discuss
the Baxter-Fendley free parafermionic Z(N) spin chain, which is a relatively
simple non-Hermitian generalization of the Ising model.

<h3>A quantum Monte Carlo based density functional for Dysprosium dipolar  system</h3>

<br>
<i>Raúl Bombín, Viktor Cikojević, Ferran Mazzanti, Jordi Boronat</i>
<p>We present a quantum Monte Carlo based density functional to describe droplet
formation and supersolidity in dipolar systems. The usual Lee-Huang-Yang term,
accounting for quantum correlations in the conventional extended
Gross-Pitaievskii equation (eGPE), has been substituted by the correlation
energy evaluated with Quantum Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the ability of the
new functional to reproduce existing experimental data for the minimum critical
number of atoms $N_\mathrm{c}$ required for droplet formation. $N_\mathrm{c}$
is a challenging quantity for theoretical predictions, and the eGPE provides
only a qualitative description of it, mainly when it is applied to Dysprosium.
We also use the new approach to characterize the BEC-supersolid transition. The
quantum Monte Carlo based functional can be easily implemented in any existing
eGPE code, improving the description of dipolar systems without increasing the
computational cost.

<i>Shaina Gandhi, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay</i>
<p>We investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Harper model, considering both the
short- and long-range p-wave pairing. Here, the non-Hermiticity is considered
at the onsite potential. A comprehensive analysis of several critical aspects
of this system, including the eigenspectra, localization properties, PT}
symmetry, real to complex transition, and topological properties, is conducted.
Specifically, we observe the emergence of Majorana zero modes in the case of
short-range pairing, whereas the massive Dirac modes emerge in the case of
long-range pairing. Notably, a triple-phase transition is identified, involving
simultaneous transitions from extended or metallic state to critical
multifractal state, unbroken to broken PT symmetry, and unconventional real to
complex energies. In addition, a double-phase transition is observed, where the
topological and superconducting transitions occur concurrently. These
intriguing double- and triple-phase transitions are observed in both short- and
long-range pairing cases.

<br>
<i>Masataka Kakoi, Keith Slevin</i>
<p>We investigate, both numerically and analytically, the time evolution of a
particle in an initial plane wave state as it is subject to elastic scattering
in a two-dimensional disordered system with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the
analytic calculation, we treat the SOC non-perturbatively, and the disorder
perturbatively using the Diffuson and the Cooperon. We identify weak and strong
SOC regimes, and give the relevant time and energy scales in each case. We
calculate the time dependence of coherent backscattering (CBS) as a function of
the strength of the SOC. By studying the time dependence of the anisotropy of
the disorder-averaged momentum distribution we identify the spin relaxation
time. We find a crossover from D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation for weak SOC to
Elliot-Yafet like behaviour for strong SOC.

<h3>Pairing symmetries of multiple superconducting phases in UTe2:  Competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations</h3>

<br>
<i>Jushin Tei, Mizushima Takeshi, Satoshi Fujimoto</i>
<p>The putative spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 exhibits multiple
superconducting phases under applied pressure [D. Braithwaite et al., Commun.
Phys. 2, 1 (2019)]. The clarification of pairing mechanisms and symmetries of
gap functions are essentially important for understanding the multiple-phase
diagram. Since the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin
fluctuations with Ising-like anisotropy is suggested from measurements of
magnetic susceptibilities and neutron scattering measurements, it is expected
that the interplay between these spin fluctuations plays a crucial role in the
emergence of the multiple superconducting phases. Motivated by these
observations, we examine the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing mechanism,
analyzing the linearized Eliashberg equations for an effective model of
f-electron bands. It is found that the Ising-like ferromagnetic fluctuations
stabilize spin-triplet pairings in either the Au or B3u states, whereas
Ising-like antiferromagnetic fluctuations stabilize spin-triplet pairings in
the B1u state. These results provide a plausible scenario elucidating the
multiple superconducting phases under pressure.

<p>We investigate the feasibility of epitaxial growth of a three-dimensional
semiconductor on a two-dimensional substrate. In particular, we report for the
first time on molecular beam epitaxy growth of cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum
wells on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The presence of the quantum wells is
confirmed by photoluminescence measurements conducted at helium temperatures.
Growth of quantum wells on two dimensional, almost perfectly flat hBN appears
to be very different from growth on bulk substrates, in particular it requires
70-100$^\circ$C lower temperatures.

<h3>A Complex Network Analysis on The Eigenvalue Spectra of Random Spin  Systems</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04665" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04665</a>
<br>
<i>Qiaomu Xue, Wenjia Rao</i>
<p>Recent works have established a novel viewpoint that treats the eigenvalue
spectra of disordered quantum systems as time-series, and corresponding
algorithms such as singular-value-decomposition has proven its advantage in
studying subtle physical quantities like Thouless energy and non-ergodic
extended regime. On the other hand, algorithms from complex networks have long
been known as a powerful tool to study highly nonlinear time-series. In this
work, we combine these two ideas together. Using the particular algorithm
called visibility graph (VG) that transforms the eigenvalue spectra of a random
spin system into complex networks, it's shown the degree distribution of the
resulting network is capable of signaturing the eigenvalue evolution during the
thermal to many-body localization transition, and the networks in the thermal
phase have a small-world structure. We further show these results are robust
even when the eigenvalues are incomplete with missing levels, which reveals the
advantage of the VG algorithm.

<h3>Interaction of monoclinic ZrO$_2$ grain boundaries with oxygen  vacancies, Sn and Nb -- implications for the corrosion of Zr alloy fuel  cladding</h3>

<br>
<i>Maria S. Yankova, Christopher P. Race</i>
<p>We used density-functional-theory simulations to examine the structural and
electronic properties of the $\Sigma 180{\deg}(100)[001] $ grain boundary in
monoclinic ZrO$_2$, which is a very low-energy (0.06Jm$^{-2}$) twin boundary
present in experimental oxide texture maps, with suggested special properties.
This equilibrium structure was compared with a metastable structure (with a
boundary energy of 0.32Jm$^{-2}$), which was considered to be representative of
a more general oxide boundary. The interaction of oxygen vacancies,
substitutional Sn and Nb defects (substituting host Zr sites) with both
structures - and their effect on the boundary properties - were examined. We
found that the equilibrium structure energetically favours V$_\textrm{O}^{2+}$
and Nb$_\textrm{Zr}^{2-}$, whereas the metastable structure favours
V$_\textrm{O}^{2+}$ and Sn$_\textrm{Zr}^{2-}$. Tin was further found to bind
strongly with oxygen vacancies in both structures, and introduce gap states in
the band gap of their electronic structure. Sn$_\textrm{Zr}^{2-}$ was, however,
found to increase the segregation preference of V$_\textrm{O}^{2+}$ for the
metastable structure, which might contribute to increased oxygen and electron
transport down this interface, and therefore other more general boundaries,
compared to the equilibrium structure of the studied monoclinic twin boundary.

<h3>Noise-Induced Collective Actuation in Active Solids</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04669" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04669</a>
<br>
<i>Paul Baconnier, Vincent Démery, Olivier Dauchot</i>
<p>Collective actuation describes the spontaneous synchronized oscillations
taking place in active solids, when the elasto-active feedback, that
generically couples the reorientation of the active forces and the elastic
stress, is large enough. In the absence of noise, collective actuation takes
the form of a strong condensation of the dynamics on a specific pair of modes
and their generalized harmonics. Here we report new experiments conducted with
centimetric active elastic structures, where collective oscillation takes place
along the single lowest energy mode of the system, gapped from the other modes
because of the system's geometry. Combining the numerical and theoretical
analysis of an agent-based model, we demonstrate that this new form of
collective actuation is noise-induced. The effect of the noise is first
analyzed in a single-particle toy model that reveals the interplay between the
noise and the specific structure of the phase space. We then show that in the
continuous limit, any finite amount of noise turns this new form of transition
to collective actuation into a bona fide supercritical Hopf bifurcation.

<i>Zoltán Tajkov, Konrád Kandrai, Dániel Nagy, Levente Tapasztó, János Koltai, Péter Nemes-Incze</i>
<p>Understanding the topological aspects of the band structure of solids has
fundamentally changed our appreciation of their properties. The layered, van
der Waals transition-metal pentatelluride ZrTe$_5$ has proven on numerous
occasions to be an excellent candidate for the study of controllable
topological phase transitions. Here, we investigate the topological phase
diagrams of monolayer and bilayer forms of ZrTe$_5$, under mechanical
deformations using \textit{ab initio} techniques. We find that mechanical
deformation can close the monolayer's topological gap, while the bilayer
exhibits richer phase diagram, including both topological insulating, trivial
metallic and insulating phases. The bilayer is predicted to be on the
topological phase boundary. We also address the preparation of monolayers,
using \emph{ab initio} simulations and experimental scanning tunneling
microscopy measurements. We confirm that while monolayer ZrTe$_5$ is difficult
to exfoliate without compromising its crystalline structure, bilayers offer a
more stable alternative, revealing the complexities and limitations of using
gold substrates for monolayer exfoliation.

<i>Florence Gibouin, Dharshana Nalatamby, Pierre Lidon, Yaocihuatl Medina-Gonzalez</i>
<p>Numerous formulation processes of materials involve a drying step, during
which evaporation of a solvent from a multi-component liquid mixture, often
confined in a thin film or in a droplet, lead to concentration and assembly of
non volatile compounds. While the basic phenomena ruling evaporation dynamics
are known, a precise modeling of practical situations is hindered by the lack
of tools for local and time-resolved mapping of concentration fields in such
confined systems. In this article, the use of Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
Microscopy and of Fluorescent Molecular Rotors is introduced as a versatile,
in-situ and quantitative method to map viscosity and concentration fields in
confined, evaporating liquids. More precisely, the cases of drying of a
suspended liquid film and of a sessile droplet of mixtures of fructose and
water is investigated. Measured viscosity and concentration fields allow to
characterize drying dynamics, in agreement with simple modeling of the
evaporation process.

<p>Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) trained against quantum-mechanical
reference data have demonstrated remarkable accuracy, surpassing empirical
potentials. However, the absence of readily available general-purpose MLPs
encompassing a broad spectrum of elements and their alloys hampers the
applications of MLPs in materials science. In this study, we present a feasible
approach for constructing a unified general-purpose MLP for numerous elements
and showcase its capability by developing a model (UNEP-v1) for 16 elemental
metals (Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Ta, Ti, V, W, Zr) and their
diverse alloys. To achieve a complete representation of the chemical space, we
demonstrate that employing 16 one-component and 120 two-component systems
suffices, thereby avoiding the enumeration of all 65 535 possible combinations
for training data generation. Furthermore, we illustrate that systems with more
components can be adequately represented as interpolation points in the
descriptor space. Our unified MLP exhibits superior performance across various
physical properties as compared to the embedded-atom method potential, while
maintaining computational efficiency. It achieves a remarkable computational
speed of $1.5 \times 10^8$ atom step / second in molecular dynamics simulations
using eight 80-gigabyte A100 graphics cards, enabling simulations up to 100
million atoms. We demonstrate the generality and high efficiency of the MLP in
studying plasticity and primary radiation damage in the MoTaVW refractory
high-entropy alloys, showcasing its potential in unraveling complex materials
behavior. This work represents a significant leap towards the construction of a
unified general-purpose MLP encompassing the periodic table, with profound
implications for materials research and computational science.

<p>Recently, a new category of superfluids and superconductors has been
discovered in various systems. These could be linked to the idea of a
supersolid phase, featuring a macroscopic wavefunction with spatial modulation
resulting from simultaneous, spontaneous breaking of gauge and translational
symmetries. However, this relation has only been recognized in some cases and
there is the need for universal properties quantifying the differences between
supersolids and ordinary superfluids/superconductors or crystals. A key
property is the superfluid fraction, which measures the reduction in superfluid
stiffness due to spatial modulation, leading to the non-standard superfluid
dynamics of supersolids. Here we employ the Josephson effect, common in
superfluids and superconductors, to measure the superfluid fraction in a
supersolid. Even without a physical barrier, the Josephson effect arises
spontaneously in a supersolid due to spatial modulation. Individual lattice
cells act as self-induced Josephson junctions, allowing the direct
determination of the local superfluid fraction. We studied a cold-atom dipolar
supersolid, revealing a significant sub-unity superfluid fraction. Our results
open new research directions, enabling the exploration of novel phenomena like
partially quantized vortices and supercurrents, potentially unifying the
understanding of supersolid-like systems, and introducing a new type of
Josephson junction.

<i>Justus Leist, Jongmin Kim, Holger Euchner, Matthias M. May</i>
<p>In electrochemistry, reactions and charge-transfer are to a large extent
determined by the atomistic structure of the solid-liquid interface. Yet due to
the presence of the liquid electrolyte, many surface-science methods cannot be
applied here. Hence, the exact microscopic structure that is present under
operating conditions often remains unknown. Reflection anisotropy spectroscopy
(RAS) is one of the few techniques that allow for an in operando investigation
of the structure of solid-liquid interfaces. However, an interpretation of RAS
data on the atomistic scale can only be obtained by comparison to computational
spectroscopy. While the number of computational RAS studies related to
electrochemical systems is currently still limited, those studies so far have
not taken into account the dynamic nature of the solid-liquid interface. In
this work, we investigate the temporal evolution of the spectroscopic response
of the Au(110) missing row reconstruction in contact with water by combining ab
initio molecular dynamics with computational spectroscopy. Our results show
significant changes in the time evolution of the RA spectra, in particular
providing an explanation for the typically observed differences in intensity
when comparing theory and experiment. Moreover, these findings point to the
importance of structural surface/interface variability while at the same time
emphasising the potential of RAS for probing these dynamic interfaces.

<h3>Magnetostriction of metals with small Fermi-surface pockets: the case of  the topologically trivial semimetal LuAs</h3>

<p>We develop a theory of the magnetostriction for metals with small
charge-carrier pockets of their Fermi surfaces. As an example, we consider LuAs
that has a cubic crystal structure. The theory quite well describes the known
experimental data on the magnetostriction of this metal. The obtained results
also clearly demonstrate that the dilatometry can be used for detecting tiny
Fermi-surface pockets that are not discerned by traditional methods based on
investigations of the Shubnikov--de Haas and de Haas--van Alphen effects.

<i>Horst-Holger Boltz, Thomas Ihle</i>
<p>We comment on a work by T. Liverpool (Phys. Rev. E 101 (2020)). We show that
a theorem stated in that work is not correct. While this is inconsequential to
the bulk of the work (and holds asymptotically as we show), it is instructive
to highlight the importance of phase space compression in active systems with
generalized dynamics.

<h3>Real-space multifold degeneracy in graphene irradiated by twisted light</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04792" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04792</a>
<br>
<i>Suman Aich, Babak Seradjeh</i>
<p>We report the theoretical discovery of real-space multifold degenerate
Floquet-Bloch states in monolayer graphene coherently driven by twisted
circulalry-polarized light. Using Floquet theory, we characterize the
real-space structure of quasienergies and Floquet modes in terms of the orbital
angular momentum and radial vortex profile of light. We obtain the effective
real-space Floquet Hamiltonian and show it supports crossings of Floquet modes,
especially at high-symmetry $K$ and $\Gamma$ points of graphene, at specific
radial positions from the vortex center. At specific frequencies, the vortex
bound states form a multifold degenerate structure in real-space. This
structure is purely dynamically generated and controlled by the frequency and
intensity of twisted light. We discuss the experimental feasibility of
observing and employing the real-space multifold degeneracy for coherent
optoelectronic quantum state engineering.

<h3>Coherent control of magnetization precession by double-pulse activation  of effective fields from magnetoacoustics and demagnetization</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04803" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04803</a>
<br>
<i>M. Mattern, F.-C. Weber, D. Engel, C. Korff-Schmising, M. Bargheer</i>
<p>We demonstrate the coherent optical control of magnetization precession in a
thin Ni film by a second excitation pulse which amplifies or attenuates the
precession induced by a first pulse depending on the fluences of the
pump-pulses and the pump-pump delay. This control goes beyond the conventional
strategy, where the same mechanism drives the precession in or out-of phase. We
balance the magneto-acoustic mechanism driven by quasi-static strain and the
shape-anisotropy change triggered by laser-induced demagnetization. These
mechanisms tilt the transient effective magnetic field in opposite directions
in case of negative magneto-elastic coupling ($b_1<0$). While the strain
response is linear in the fluence, demagnetization is nonlinear near the Curie
temperature, enabling fluence-based control scenarios.

<p>Corundum oxide Ti$_2$O$_3$ shows the metal-insulator transition around
400-600 K accompanying the nearest Ti$^{3+}$-Ti$^{3+}$ bond ($a_{1g}a_{1g}$
singlet state) formation along the $c$ axis. In order to clarify the
hole-doping effect for the $a_{1g}a_{1g}$ singlet bond in Ti$_2$O$_3$, we
investigated Ti $3d$ orbital anisotropy between corundum-type Ti$_2$O$_3$ and
ilmenite-type MgTiO$_3$ using linear dichroism of soft x-ray absorption
spectroscopy of the Ti $L_{2,3}$ edge. From the linear dichroic spectral weight
in Mg$_y$Ti$_{2-y}$O$_3$, we confirmed that the $a_{1g}a_{1g}$ state is
dominant not only in $y=0.01$ (almost Ti$_2$O$_3$), but also in $y = 0.29$,
indicating that the Ti-Ti bond survives against a certain level of hole doping.
In $y=0.63$ corresponding to 46% hole doping per Ti, the $3d$ orbital symmetry
changes from $a_{1g}$ to $e_g^{\pi}$.

<h3>Predicting Bubble Fragmentation in Superfluids</h3>

<i>Jake McMillan, Thomas A Flynn, Ryan Doran</i>
<p>In classical fluids, the Weber number is a dimensionless parameter that
characterises the flow of a multi-phase fluid. The superfluid analogy of a
classical multi-phase fluid can be realised in a system of two or more
immiscible Bose-Einstein condensates. These superfluid mixtures have been shown
to display a wider variety of exotic dynamics than their single component
counterparts. Here we systematically study the dynamics of a binary immiscible
Bose-Einstein Condensate in two dimensions, where a small bubble of the second
component is used to "stir" the first component. We begin by rigorously mapping
out the critical velocity for vortex shedding as a function of the size of the
bubble, in analogy to the critical velocity of a laser spoon. Observing that
the dynamics of the system depend on the initial size and velocity of the
bubble, we then show that a dimensionless parameter with the same form as the
Weber number accurately predicts the resulting bubble fragmentation.

<h3>Phosphorescence by trapping defects in boric acid induced by thermal  processing</h3>

<p>The phosphorescence of boric acid at room temperature is a puzzling
phenomenon subject to controversial interpretations although the role of
structural defects has not yet been considered. Heat treatments of boric acid
cause its transformation into the metaboric phase and amorphous boron oxide.
The structural changes after thermal processing can create defects that become
centers of luminescence and recombination channels in the visible range. In the
present work, we have thermally processed commercial boric acid at different
temperatures. Samples treated between 200 and 400{\deg}C exhibit remarkable
phosphorescence in the visible range. At around 480 and 528 nm, two distinct
phosphorescent emissions occur, associated with trapped charge carriers
recombinations identified by thermoluminescence and electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy. Our structural and optical studies suggest that the
activation of boric acid phosphorescence after heat treatment is correlated
with the presence of defects. The afterglow results from a trapping and
detrapping process, which delays the recombination at the active optical
centers. Time-dependent density functional study of defective BOH molecules and
clusters shows the emergence of near UV and blue optical transitions in
absorption. These defects trigger the photoluminescence in thermally processed
boric acid samples.

<h3>Domain coarsening in polycrystalline graphene</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04842" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04842</a>
<br>
<i>Zihua Liu, Debabrata Panja, Gerard T. Barkema</i>
<p>Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon material which exhibits exceptional
properties, making it highly suitable for a wide range of applications.
Practical graphene fabrication often yields a polycrystalline structure with
many inherent defects, which significantly influence its performance. In this
study, we utilize a Monte Carlo approach based on the optimized Wooten, Winer
and Weaire (WWW) algorithm to simulate the crystalline domain coarsening
process of polycrystalline graphene. Our sample configurations show excellent
agreement with experimental data. We conduct statistical analyses of the bond
and angle distribution, temporal evolution of the defect distribution, and
spatial correlation of the lattice orientation that follows a stretched
exponential distribution. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the diffusion
behavior of defects and find that the changes in domain size follow a power-law
distribution. We briefly discuss the possible connections of these results to
(and differences from) domain growth processes in other statistical models,
such as the Ising dynamics. We also examine the impact of buckling of
polycrystalline graphene on the crystallization rate under substrate effects.
Our findings may offer valuable guidance and insights for both theoretical
investigations and experimental advancements.

<h3>d-Wave Hall effect and linear magnetoconductivity in metallic collinear  antiferromagnets</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04890" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04890</a>

<i>Dmitrii L. Vorobev, Vladimir A. Zyuzin</i>
<p>In this paper we theoretically predict a distinct class of anomalous Hall
effects occurring in metallic collinear antiferromagnets. The effect is
quadratic and $d-$wave symmetric in external magnetic field. In addition, the
electric current, transverse to the current voltage drop and the magnetic field
in the predicted effect are all in the same plane. Studied theoretical model
consists of two-dimensional fermions interacting with the Neel order through
momentum dependent exchange interaction having a $d-$wave symmetry. We also
find unusual linear magnetoconductivity in this model.

<h3>Floquet engineering of binding in doped and photo-doped Mott insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04899" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04899</a>
<br>
<i>Madhumita Sarkar, Zala Lenarčič, Denis Golež</i>
<p>We investigate the emergence of bound states in chemically and photo-doped
Mott insulators, assisted by spin and $\eta$-pairing fluctuations within both
2-leg ladder and 2D systems. We demonstrate that the binding energies and
localization length in the chemically and photo-doped regimes are comparable.
To effectively describe the photo and chemically doped state on the same
footings, we employ the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, resulting in a
generalized $t$-$J$ model. Furthermore, we show that manipulating the binding
is possible through external periodic driving, a technique known as Floquet
engineering, leading to significantly enhanced binding energies. We also
roughly estimate the lifetime of photo-doped states under periodic driving
conditions based on the Fermi golden rule. Lastly, we propose experimental
protocols for realizing Hubbard excitons in cold-atom experiments.
