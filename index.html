<h3>Incoherent transport in a model for the strange metal phase:  Memory-matrix formalism</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07125" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07125</a>

We revisit a phenomenological model of fermions coupled to fluctuating bosons
that emerges from finite-momentum particle-particle pairs for describing the
strange metal phase in the cuprates. The incoherent bosons dominate the
transport properties for the resistivity and optical conductivity in the
non-Fermi liquid phase. Within the Kubo formalism, the resistivity is
approximately linear in temperature with a Drude form for the optical
conductivity, such that the Drude lifetime is inversely proportional to the
temperature. Additionally, when the bosons emerge from electron pairs with
spin-triplet symmetry, the magnetoresistance has a linear magnetic field
dependence. Here, we compute the transport properties of such bosons within the
memory-matrix approach that successfully captures the hydrodynamic regime. This
technique emerges as the appropriate framework for describing the transport
coefficients of the strange metal phase. Our analysis confirms the $T$-linear
resistivity due to the Umklapp scattering that we obtained for this effective
model. Finally, we provide new predictions regarding the variation of the
thermal conductivity with temperature and examine the validity of the
Wiedemann-Franz law.

<h3>Resolving the emission transition dipole moments of single  doubly-excited seeded nanorods via heralded defocused imaging</h3>

Semiconductor nanocrystal emission polarization is a crucial probe of
nanocrystal physics and an essential factor for nanocrystal-based technologies.
While the transition dipole moment of the lowest excited state to ground state
transition is well characterized, the dipole moment of higher multiexcitonic
transitions is inaccessible via most spectroscopy techniques. Here, we realize
direct characterization of the doubly-excited state relaxation transition
dipole by heralded defocused imaging. Defocused imaging maps the dipole
emission pattern onto a fast single-photon avalanche diode detector array,
allowing the post-selection of photon pairs emitted from the biexciton-exciton
emission cascade and resolving the differences in transition dipole moments.
Type-I1/2 seeded nanorods exhibit higher anisotropy of the biexciton-to-exciton
transition compared to the exciton-to-ground state transition. In contrast,
type-II seeded nanorods display a reduction of biexciton emission anisotropy.
These findings are rationalized in terms of an interplay between transient
dynamics of the refractive index and the excitonic fine structure.

Fermi liquids respond differently to perturbations depending on whether their
frequency is larger (collisionless regime) or smaller (hydrodynamic regime)
than the inter-particle collision rate. This results in a different phase
velocity between the collisionless zero sound and hydrodynamic first sound. We
performed terahertz photocurrent nanoscopy measurements on graphene devices,
with a metallic gate in close proximity to the sample, to probe the dispersion
of propagating acoustic plasmons, the counterpart of sound modes in electronic
Fermi liquids. We report the observation of a change in the plasmon phase
velocity when the excitation frequency approaches the electron-electron
collision rate. This first observation of the first sound mode in an electronic
Fermi liquid is of fundamental interest and can enable novel terahertz emitter
and detection implementations.

<h3>Direct Observation of a Superconducting Vortex Diode</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07121" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07121</a>

The interplay between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to
unconventional proximity and Josephson effects. A related phenomenon that has
recently attracted considerable attention is the superconducting diode effect,
in which a non-reciprocal critical current emerges. Although superconducting
diodes based on superconducting/ferromagnetic (S/F) bilayers were demonstrated
more than a decade ago, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. While
not formally linked to this effect, the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinikov (FFLO)
state is a plausible mechanism, due to the 2-fold rotational symmetry breaking
caused by the finite center-of-mass-momentum of the Cooper pairs. Here, we
directly observe, for the first time, a tunable superconducting vortex diode in
Nb/EuS (S/F) bilayers. Based on our nanoscale SQUID-on-tip (SOT) microscope and
supported by in-situ transport measurements, we propose a theoretical model
that captures our key results. Thus, we determine the origin for the vortex
diode effect, which builds a foundation for new device concepts.

<h3>Emergent glassy behavior in a kagome Rydberg atom array</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07127" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07127</a>

<i>Zheng Yan, Yan-Cheng Wang, Rhine Samajdar, Subir Sachdev, Zi Yang Meng</i>

We present large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation results on a realistic
Hamiltonian of kagome-lattice Rydberg atom arrays. Although the system has no
intrinsic disorder, intriguingly, our analyses of static and dynamic properties
on large system sizes reveal \textit{emergent} glassy behavior in a region of
parameter space located between two valence bond solid phases. The extent of
this glassy region is demarcated using the Edwards-Anderson order parameter,
and its phase transitions to the two proximate valence bond solids -- as well
as the crossover towards a trivial paramagnetic phase -- are identified. We
demonstrate the intrinsically slow (imaginary) time dynamics deep inside the
glassy phase and discuss experimental considerations for detecting such a
quantum disordered phase with numerous nearly degenerate local minima. Our
proposal paves a new route to the study of real-time glassy phenomena and
highlights the potential for quantum simulation of a distinct phase of quantum
matter beyond solids and liquids in current-generation Rydberg platforms.

<h3>Multipartite entanglement in two-dimensional chiral topological liquids</h3>

The multipartite entanglement structure for the ground states of two
dimensional topological phases is an interesting albeit not well understood
question. Utilizing the bulk-boundary correspondence, the calculation of
tripartite entanglement in 2d topological phases can be reduced to that of the
vertex state, defined by the boundary conditions at the interfaces between
spatial regions. In this paper, we use the conformal interface technique to
calculate entanglement measures in the vertex state, which include area law
terms, corner contributions, and topological pieces, and a possible additional
order one contribution. This explains our previous observation of the Markov
gap $h = \frac{c}{3} \ln 2$ in the 3-vertex state, and generalizes this result
to the $p$-vertex state, general rational conformal field theories, and more
choices of subsystems. Finally, we support our prediction by numerical
evidence, finding precise agreement.

<h3>Magnetic frustration driven by conduction carrier blocking in  Nd$_2$Co$_{0.85}$Si$_{2.88}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07140" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07140</a>
<br>
<i>Mily Kundu, Santanu Pakhira, Renu Choudhary, Shuvankar Gupta, Sudip Chakraborty, N. Lakshminarasimhan, R. Ranganathan, Duane D. Johnson, Chandan Mazumdar</i>
<br>
<br>
The intermetallic compound Nd$_2$Co$_{0.85}$Si$_{2.88}$ having a triangular
lattice could be synthesized in single-phase only with defect crystal
structure. Investigation through different experimental techniques indicate the
presence of two magnetic transitions in the system. As verified experimentally
and theoretically, the high-temperature transition T$_H$ ~ 140 K is associated
with the development of ferromagnetic interaction between itinerant Co moments,
whereas the low-temperature transition at T$_L$ ~ 6.5 K is due to the coupling
among Nd-4f and Co-3d moments, which is antiferromagnetic in nature. Detailed
studies of temperature-dependent dc magnetic susceptibility, field dependence
of isothermal magnetization, non-equilibrium dynamical behavior, viz. magnetic
relaxation, aging effect, magnetic-memory effect, and temperature dependence of
heat capacity, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggest
that the ground state is magnetically frustrated spin-glass in nature, having
competing magnetic interactions of equivalent energies. DFT results further
reveal that the 3d/5d-conduction carriers are blocked in the system and act as
a barrier for the 4f-4f RKKY interactions, resulting in spin-frustration.
Presence of vacancy defects in the crystal are also conducive to the
spin-frustration. This is an unique mechanism of magnetic frustration, not
emphasized so far in any of the ternary R$_2$TX$_3$ (R=rare-earth, T=transition
elements and X=Si, Ge, In) type compounds. Due to the competing character of
the itinerant 3d and localized 4f moments, the compound exhibits anomalous
field dependence of magnetic coercivity.

<h3>Investigating the magneto-elastic properties in FeSn and  Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$ flat band metals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07152" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07152</a>
<br>
<i>Yu Tao, Luke Daemen, Yongqiang Cheng, Joerg C. Neuefeind, Despina Louca</i>
<br>
<br>
Topological quantum magnets FeSn and Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$ were studied using
neutron scattering and first-principles calculations. Both materials are
metallic but host dispersionless flat bands with Dirac nodes at the $K$ point
in reciprocal space. The local structure determined from the pair density
function analysis of the neutron diffraction data provided no evidence for
electron localization in both compounds, consistent with their metallic nature.
At the same time, in FeSn, an anomalous suppression in the $c$-axis lattice
constant coupled with changes in the phonon spectra were observed across
T$_{N}$ indicating the presence of magneto-elastic coupling and spin-phonon
interactions. In addition, it was observed that spin waves persisted well above
T$_{N}$, suggesting that the in-plane ferromagnetic spin correlations survive
at high temperatures. In contrast, no lattice anomaly was observed in
Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{2}$. The inelastic signal could be mostly accounted for by
phonons, determined from density functional theory, showing typical softening
on warming.

<br>
<br>
We apply a topological material design concept for selecting a bulk topology
of 3D crystals by different van-der-Waals stacking of 2D topological insulator
layers, and find a bismuth halide Bi4Br2I2 to be an ideal weak topological
insulator (WTI) with the largest band gap (~230 meV) among all the WTI
candidates, by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES),
density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and resistivity measurements. Our
results vastly expand future opportunities for fundamental research and device
applications with a robust WTI.

<h3>Doping-dependent charge- and spin-density wave orderings in a monolayer  of Pb adatoms on Si(111)</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07162" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07162</a>
<br>
<i>Matteo Vandelli, Anna Galler, Angel Rubio, Alexander I. Lichtenstein, Silke Biermann, Evgeny A. Stepanov</i>
<br>
<br>
In this work we computed the phase diagram as a function of temperature and
doping for a system of lead adatoms allocated periodically on a silicon (111)
surface. This Si(111):Pb material is characterized by a strong and long-ranged
Coulomb interaction, a relatively large value of the spin-orbit coupling, and a
structural phase transition that occurs at low temperature. In order to
describe the collective electronic behavior in the system, we perform many-body
calculations consistently taking all these important features into account. We
find that charge- and spin-density wave orderings coexist with each other in
several regions of the phase diagram. This result is in agreement with the
recent experimental observation of a chiral spin texture in the charge density
wave phase in this material. We also find that geometries of the charge and
spin textures strongly depend on the doping level. The formation of such a rich
phase diagram in the Si(111):Pb material can be explained by a combined effect
of the lattice distortion and electronic correlations.

<h3>Epitaxial NaxCoO2 Thin Films via Molecular-Beam Epitaxy and Topotactic  Transformation: a Model System for Sodium Intercalation</h3>

Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are critical to combatting
global warming. Nevertheless, their intermittent energy generation requires the
development of large-scale grid energy storage, in contrast to the on-demand
generation of coal-based power plants. Sodium-ion batteries offer a promising
potential technology, yet because sodium ions are larger than lithium ions,
sodium-ion intercalation results in more drastic structural rearrangements. An
improved understanding of structural dynamics and ionic diffusion pathways is
crucial to developing more durable sodium-ion batteries. Here we synthesize
epitaxial NaxCoO2 by using molecular-beam epitaxy and topotactic
transformation. In the synthesized epitaxial films, the CoO2 layers are canted
with respect to the film surface, allowing electrochemical extraction of sodium
ions, which we confirm via ex-situ x-ray diffraction. We anticipate the
epitaxial thin films reported here to enable future operando studies of
interfaces, subtle lattice distortions, and microstructure during
electrochemical cycling.

<h3>Momentum-space signatures of the Anderson transition in a symplectic,  two-dimensional, disordered ultracold gas</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07288" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07288</a>
<br>
<i>Ehsan Arabahmadi, Daniel Schumayer, Benoit Gremaud, Christian Miniatura, David A. W. Hutchinson</i>
<br>
<br>
We study Anderson Localization in two dimensional (2D) disordered spin-orbit
systems described by the Gaussian symplectic ensemble using momentum-space
signatures such as the coherent backscattering (CBS) anti-peak, and the
coherent forward scattering (CFS) peak. Significantly, these momentum-space
features are readily accessible in ultracold atom experiments through
absorption imaging after time-of-flight expansion. The critical exponent and
mobility edge of the metal-insulator transition are successfully obtained in
this model through a finite-time analysis of the CBS width. An anomalous
residual diffusion, unique to 2D, is identified at the transition point where
the system changes from a metal to an insulator. A spin localization phenomenon
is also observed in the deep localized regime.

<h3>Localization Properties in Disordered Quantum Many-Body Dynamics under  Continuous Measurement</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07290" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07290</a>
<br>
<i>Kazuki Yamamoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki</i>
<br>
<br>
We study localization properties of continuously monitored dynamics and
associated measurement-induced phase transitions in disordered quantum
many-body systems on the basis of the quantum trajectory approach. By
calculating the fidelity between random quantum trajectories, we demonstrate
that the disorder and the measurement can lead to dynamical properties distinct
from each other, although both have a power to suppress the entanglement
spreading. In particular, in the large-disorder regime with weak measurement,
we elucidate that the fidelity exhibits an anomalous power-law decay before
saturating to the steady-state value. Furthermore, we propose a general method
to access physical quantities for quantum trajectories in continuously
monitored dynamics without resorting to postselection. It is demonstrated that
this scheme drastically reduces the cost of experiments. Our results can be
tested in ultracold atoms subject to continuous measurement and open the avenue
to study dynamical properties of localization, which cannot be understood from
the stationary properties of the entanglement entropy.

<h3>Evolution of orbital excitations from insulating to superconducting  MgTi$_2$O$_4$ films</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07299" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07299</a>

<br>
<br>
Spinel oxides are well-known functional materials but rarely show
superconductivity. Recently, emergent superconductivity was discovered in
MgTi$_2$O$_4$, which is attributed to the increase of electron doping and the
suppression of orbital order. Here, we utilized Ti $L$-edge resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering to study the orbital excitations in superconducting (SC) and
insulating MgTi$_2$O$_4$ films. We find that the spectral weight of orbital
excitations is enhanced and the energy of $t_{2g}$ intra-band excitation is
softened in the SC film compared to the insulating one, suggesting higher
electron doping and suppressed orbital order gap in the SC sample. These
observations were further supported by our multiplet calculations using minimal
two-site model. Our results provide spectroscopic evidence for the competition
between orbital order and superconductivity in MgTi$_2$O$_4$ and shed light on
searching for novel superconductors in spinel oxides.

<h3>From creep to flow: Granular materials under cyclic shear</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07309" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07309</a>
<br>
<i>Ye Yuan, Zhikun Zeng, Yi Xing, Houfei Yuan, Shuyang Zhang, Walter Kob, Yujie Wang</i>
<br>
<br>
Granular materials such as sand, powders, and grains are omnipresent in daily
life, industrial applications, and earth-science [1]. When unperturbed, they
form stable structures that resemble the ones of other amorphous solids like
metallic and colloidal glasses [2]. It is commonly conjectured that all these
amorphous materials show a universal mechanical response when sheared slowly,
i.e., to have an elastic regime, followed by yielding [3]. Here we use X-ray
tomography to determine the microscopic dynamics of a cyclically sheared
granular system in three dimensions. Independent of the shear amplitude
$\Gamma$, the sample shows a cross-over from creep to diffusive dynamics,
indicating that granular materials have no elastic response and always yield,
in stark contrast to other glasses. The overlap function [4] reveals that at
large $\Gamma$ yielding is a simple cross-over phenomenon, while for small
$\Gamma$ it shows features of a first order transition with a critical point at
$\Gamma\approx 0.1$ at which one finds a pronounced slowing down and dynamical
heterogeneity. Our findings are directly related to the surface roughness of
granular particles which induces a micro-corrugation to the potential energy
landscape, thus creating relaxation channels that are absent in simple glasses.
These processes must be understood for reaching an understanding of the complex
relaxation dynamics of granular systems.

<h3>Magnon-magnon interactions induced by spin pumping-driven symmetry  breaking in synthetic antiferromagnets</h3>

<br>
<br>
The richness in both the dispersion and energy of antiferromagnetic magnons
has spurred the magnetism community to consider antiferromagnets for future
spintronic/magnonic applications. However, the excitation and control of
antiferromagnetic magnons remains challenging, especially when compared to
ferromagnetic counterparts. A middle ground is found with synthetic
antiferromagnet metamaterials, where acoustic and optical magnons exist at GHz
frequencies. In these materials, the magnon energy spectrum can be tuned by
static symmetry-breaking external fields or dipolar interactions hybridizing
optical and acoustic magnon branches. Here, we experimentally measure the
magnon energy spectrum of synthetic antiferromagnetic tetralayers, and discover
avoided energy level crossings in the energy spectrum that are unexplained by
the antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling. We explain our experimental results
using a phenomenological model incorporating both fieldlike and dampinglike
torques generated by spin pumping in noncollinear magnetic multilayers
separated by normal-metal spacers. We show that an asymmetry in the fieldlike
torques acting on different magnetic layers can lift the spectral degeneracies
of acoustic and optical magnon branches and yield symmetry-breaking induced
magnon-magnon interactions. Our work extends the phenomenology of spin pumping
to noncollinear magnetization configurations and significantly expands ways of
engineering magnon-magnon interactions within antiferromagnets and quantum
hybrid magnonic materials.

<h3>Chiral edge state coupling theory of transport in quantum anomalous Hall  insulators</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07319" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07319</a>
<br>
<i>Rui Chen, Hai-Peng Sun, Bin Zhou, Dong-Hui Xu</i>
<br>
<br>
Theoretically, the quantum anomalous Hall effect is characterized by a
quantized Hall conductance. However, many experiments only reported the
quantization of the Hall resistance, which is accompanied by a non-vanishing
longitudinal resistance, resulting in a non-quantized Hall conductance.
Meanwhile, the non-vanishing longitudinal resistance features a universal
exponential decay with the increase in magnetic field. Such a discrepancy
obviously challenges the understanding of the quantum anomalous Hall effect. To
this end, we propose that the coupling of chiral edge states, which has not
been properly evaluated in the previous theories, hinders the quantization of
the Hall conductance, while it maintains the quantization of the Hall
resistance. The coupling between the chiral edges states along the opposite
boundaries can be assisted by magnetic domains or defects inside the sample
bulk, which has been already identified in recent experiments. We demonstrate
that the chiral edge state coupling theory works rather well to explain the
experimental results in both magnetic topological insulator and moir\'e
superlattice systems.

<h3>Tailoring Zero-Field Magnetic Skyrmions in Chiral Multilayers by a Duet  of Interlayer Exchange Couplings</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07327" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07327</a>
<br>
<i>Xiaoye Chen, Tommy Tai, Hui Ru Tan, Hang Khume Tan, Royston Lim, Pin Ho, Anjan Soumyanarayanan</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic skyrmions have emerged as promising elements for encoding
information towards biomimetic computing applications due to their
pseudoparticle nature and efficient coupling to spin currents. A key hindrance
for skyrmionic devices is their instability against elongation at zero magnetic
field (ZF). Prevailing materials approaches focussed on tailoring skyrmion
energetics have found ZF configurations to be highly sensitive, which imposes
significant growth constraints and limits their device scalability. Here we
propose that designer ZF skyrmion configurations can be robustly stabilized
within chiral multilayer stacks by exploiting a duet of interlayer exchange
couplings (IECs). Microscopic imaging experiments show that varying the two
IECs enables the coarse and fine-tuning of ZF skyrmion stability and density.
Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the duo-IEC approach is distinguished by
its influence on the kinetics of skyrmion nucleation, in addition to the
ability to tailor energetics, resulting in a substantially expanded parameter
space, and enhanced stability for individual ZF skyrmions. Our work underscores
the importance of IEC as a means of stabilizing and controlling ZF skyrmions,
paving the way to scalable skyrmion-based devices.

<br>
<br>
Mixing two chemical elements at the surface of a substrate is known to
produce rich phase diagrams of surface alloys. Here, we extend the concept of
surface alloying to the case where the two constituent elements are not both
atoms, but rather one atom (copper) and one molecule (fullerene). When
deposited at room temperature on a Cu(111) surface, fullerenes intermix with
the metal substrate. Surprisingly, 10 distinct copper-fullerene surface alloys
are found to coexist. The structure of these alloys, i.e. their composition and
commensurability relationship with the substrate, is resolved using scanning
tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. This diversity
in the alloying process is associated to the multiple possibilities a fullerene
can bind to the Cu surface. The molecules are indeed found to have in-plane and
out-of-plane positional degree of freedom: the molecular alloys have elastic
in-plane properties and can buckle. In addition, the molecules can rotate on
their binding sites, conferring extra degrees of freedom to the system. We
introduce a competing-interaction energy model, parametrized against the
results of the \textit{ab initio} calculations, that describes well all the
phases we observe experimentally.

Disorder can localize the eigenstates of one-dimensional non-Hermitian
systems, leading to an Anderson transition with a critical exponent of 1. We
show that, due to the lack of energy conservation, the dynamics of individual,
real-space wave packets follows a different behavior. Both transitions between
localization and unidirectional amplification, as well as transitions between
distinct propagating phases become possible. The critical exponent of the
transition equals $1/2$ in propagating-propagating transitions.

The kagome metal CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ features an unusual competition between
the charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Evidence for
time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) inside the CDW phase has been
accumulating. Hence, the superconductivity in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ emerges from a
TRSB normal state, potentially resulting in an exotic superconducting state. To
reveal the pairing symmetry, we first investigate the effect of nonmagnetic
impurity. Our results show that the superconducting critical temperature is
insensitive to disorder, pointing to conventional $s$-wave superconductivity.
Moreover, our measurements of the self-field critical current ($I_{c,sf}$),
which is related to the London penetration depth, also confirm conventional
$s$-wave superconductivity with strong coupling. Finally, we measure $I_{c,sf}$
where the CDW order is removed by pressure and superconductivity emerges from
the pristine normal state. Our results show that $s$-wave gap symmetry is
retained, providing strong evidence for the presence of conventional $s$-wave
superconductivity in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ irrespective of the presence of the TRSB

<h3>Magnons, Phonons, and Thermal Hall Effect in Candidate Kitaev Magnet  $α$-RuCl$_3$</h3>

We study the nature of the debated thermal Hall effect in the candidate
Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Without assuming the existence of a gapped
spin liquid, we show that a realistic minimal spin model in the canted zigzag
phase suffices, at the level of linear spin-wave theory, to qualitatively
explain the observed temperature and magnetic field dependence of the
non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$, with its origin lying in
the Berry curvature of the magnon bands. The magnitude of the effect is however
too small compared to the measurement by Czajka et al. [Nat. Mater. 22, 36-41
(2023)], even after scanning a broad range of model parameters so as to
maximize $\kappa_{xy}/T$. Recent experiments suggest that phonons play an
important role, which we show couple to the spins, endowing phonons with
chirality. The resulting intrinsic contribution, from both magnons and phonons,
is however still insufficient to explain the observed magnitude of the Hall
signal. After careful analysis of the extrinsic phonon mechanisms, we use the
recent experimental data on thermal transport in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ by
Lefran\c{c}ois et al. [Phys. Rev. X 12, 021025 (2022)] to determine the
phenomenological ratio of the extrinsic and intrinsic contributions $\eta\equiv
\kappa_{xy}^{E}/\kappa_{xy}^{I}$. We find $\eta=1.2\pm 0.5$, which when
combined with our computed intrinsic value, explains quantitavely both the
magnitude and detailed temperature dependence of the experimental thermal Hall
effect in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Topological states of matter and their corresponding properties are classical
research topics in condensed matter physics. Quite recently, the application of
materials that feature these states has been extended to the field of
electrochemical catalysis and become an emerging research topic that is
receiving increasing interest. In particular, several recent experimental
studies performed on topological semimetals have already revealed high
catalytic performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), strongly
promoting acceptance of the fresh concept of the topological catalyst. This
emerging concept has experienced rapid developments in the last few years, but
these developments have been rarely summarized. Herein, we offer a
comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art progress in developing topological
catalysts for the HER process through topological semimetals such as Weyl
semimetals, Dirac semimetals, nodal line semimetals, etc. The course of
development, the general research routes, and the fundamental mechanisms in
topological catalysts are also systematically analyzed in this review.

Nanomechanics, nanoacoustics, and nanophononics refer to the engineering of
acoustic phonons and elastic waves at the nanoscale and their interactions with
other excitations such as magnons, electrons, and photons. This engineering
enables the manipulation and control of solid-state properties that depend on
the relative positions of atoms in a lattice. The access to advanced
nanofabrication and novel characterization techniques enabled a fast
development of the fields over the last decade. The applications of
nanophononics include thermal management, ultrafast data processing,
simulation, sensing, and the development of quantum technologies. In this
review, we cover some of the milestones and breakthroughs, and identify
promising pathways of these emerging fields.

A comprehensive understanding of quantum Hall edge transmission, especially
the hole-conjugate of a Laughlin state such as a $2/3$ state, is critical for
advancing fundamental quantum Hall physics and enhancing the design of quantum
Hall edge interferometry. In this study, we report a robust intermediate
$2h/e^2$ resistance quantization in a quantum point contact (QPC) when the bulk
is set at the fractional filling $2/3$ quantum Hall state. Our results suggest
the occurrence of two equilibration processes. First, the co-propagating $1/3$
edges moving along a soft QPC arm confining potential fully equilibrate and act
as a single $2/3$ edge mode. Second, the $2/3$ edge mode is further
equilibrated with an integer $1$ edge mode formed in the QPC. The complete
mixing between them results in a diagonal resistance value quantized at
$2h/e^2$. Similar processes occur a bulk filling $5/3$, leading to an
intermediate $(2/3)h/e^2$ resistance quantization.

<h3>Potts Model with Invisible States: A Review</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07523" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07523</a>
<br>
<i>Mariana Krasnytska, Petro Sarkanych, Bertrand Berche, Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna</i>
<br>
<br>
The Potts model with invisible states was introduced to explain discrepancies
between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of phase
transitions in some systems where $Z_q$ symmetry is spontaneously broken. It
differs from the ordinary $q$-state Potts model in that each spin, besides the
usual $q$ visible states, can be also in any of $r$ so-called invisible states.
Spins in an invisible state do not interact with their neighbours but they do
contribute to the entropy of the system. As a consequence, an increase in $r$
may cause a phase transition to change from second to first order. Potts models
with invisible states describe a number of systems of interest in physics and
beyond and have been treated by various tools of statistical and mathematical
physics. In this paper we aim to give a review of this fundamental topic.

<br>
<br>
We consider a simple, purely stochastic model characterized by two conserved
quantities (mass density $a$ and energy density $h$) which is known to display
a condensation transition when $h > 2a^2$: in the localized phase a single site
hosts a finite fraction of the whole energy. Its equilibrium properties in the
thermodynamic limit are known and in a recent paper (Gabriele Gotti, Stefano
Iubini, Paolo Politi, Phys. Rev. E 103, 052133 (2021)) we studied the
transition for finite systems. Here we analyze finite-size effects on the
energy distribution and on the relaxation dynamics, showing that extremely
large systems should be studied in order to observe the asymptotic distribution
and even larger systems should be simulated in order to observe the expected
relaxation dynamics.

<h3>Making Chiral Topological Superconductivities from Non-topological  Superconductivities Through the Twist</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07553" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07553</a>
<br>
<i>Yu-Bo Liu, Jing Zhou, Fan Yang</i>
<br>
<br>
In this paper, we propose a general scheme to realize chiral TSCs through the
``{\it twistronics}''. Suppose we have a $D_n$-symmetric monolayer
superconductor, which carries non-topological SC with pairing angular momentum
$L=n/2$. Here we propose that we can obtain chiral TSC with the same $L$, by
stacking two such monolayers with the largest twist angle $\pi/n$, forming a
Moireless quasi-crystal (QC) structure, dubbed as the twist-bilayer QC (TB-QC)
here. The chiral TSC in the TB-QC is driven by the interlay Josephson coupling
between the pairing order parameters of the two layers. An argument based on
the universal Ginzburg-Landau theory is provided to understand this proposal.
One known example which fits our proposal is the $d+id$-chiral TSC in the
45$^\circ$-twisted bilayer cuprates. Here, based on the microscopic framework
developed previously to treat with the electron-electron interactions in the
TB-QC, we demonstrate the application of our proposal to a new example, i.e.
the $f+if$-chiral TSC obtained by twisting two properly-doped
honeycomb-Hubbard-model monolayers by the angle 30$^\circ$. This example is
related to the newly synthesized 30$^\circ$-twisted bilayer graphene.

<h3>Experimental Evidence for the Spiral Spin Liquid in LiYbO$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
Spiral spin liquids are an exotic class of correlated paramagnets with an
enigmatic magnetic ground state composed of a degenerate manifold of
fluctuating spin spirals. Experimental realisations of the spiral spin liquid
are scarce, mainly due to the prominence of structural distortions in candidate
materials that can trigger order-by-disorder transitions to more conventionally
ordered magnetic ground states. Expanding the pool of candidate materials that
may host a spiral spin liquid is therefore crucial to realising this novel
magnetic ground state and understanding its robustness against perturbations
that arise in real materials. Here, we show that the material LiYbO$_2$ is the
first experimental realisation of a spiral spin liquid predicted to emerge from
the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on an elongated diamond lattice. Through a
complementary combination of high-resolution and diffuse neutron magnetic
scattering studies on a polycrystalline sample, we demonstrate that LiYbO$_2$
fulfils the requirements for the experimental realisation of the spiral spin
liquid and reconstruct single-crystal diffuse neutron magnetic scattering maps
that reveal continuous spiral spin contours -- a characteristic experimental
hallmark of this exotic magnetic phase.

<h3>Mean Stress Tensor of Discrete Particle Systems in Submerged Conditions</h3>

<br>

<br>
<br>
The mean stress tensor is essential to investigate the dynamics of granular
material. In this paper, we use Hamilton's principle of least action to derive
the averaged stress tensor of discrete granular assemblies subjected to
hydraulic force fields, as well as rigorous conditions for a proper definition
of the Representative Volume Element (RVE). The main goal behind our efforts is
to upscale particle physics into a sound stress tensor for systems involving
the complex interaction between grains and water. We identify the contributions
from the unbalanced forces, hydraulic forces, gravity, external forces, and
particle fluctuation to the mean stress tensor. In doing so, it is convenient
to separate the influence of different force fields when the granular system is
subjected to complex environments, e.g., subaqueous conditions. The obtained
formula is then validated by triaxial test simulations of dry and saturated
granular systems using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the
Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). The results show that the deduced formula can
accurately calculate the stress tensor of discrete assemblies with various
body-force fields. We used validated DEM-LBM simulations of submerged granular
column collapses to explore the physics happening at the grain scale with this
mathematical formalism and showcase its potential. We provide a new perspective
based on the granular assembly scale to pursue the fluid-solid interaction. Due
to the importance of stress analysis in the constitutive modelling of granular
materials, this work could help to better obtain the stress-strain relationship
of saturated or submerged granular systems.

<h3>Multiscale statistical quantum transport in porous media and random  alloys with vacancies</h3>

<br>
<i>Elham Sharafedini, Hossein Hamzehpour, Mohammad Alidoust</i>
<br>
<br>
We have developed a multi-scale self-consistent method to study the charge
conductivity of a porous system or a metallic matrix alloyed by randomly
distributed nonmetallic grains and vacancies by incorporating Schr\"{o}dinger's
equation and Poisson's equation. To account for the random distribution of the
nonmetallic grains and clusters within the alloy system, we have used an
uncorrelated white-noise Monte-Carlo sampling to generate numerous random
alloys and statistically evaluate the charge conductance. We have performed a
parametric study and investigated various electrical aspects of random porous
and alloy systems as a function of the inherent parameters and density of the
random grains. Our results find that the charge conductance within the
low-voltage regime shows a highly nonlinear behavior against voltage variations
in stark contrast to the high-voltage regime where the charge conductance is
constant. The former finding is a direct consequence of the quantum scattering
processes. The results reveal the threshold to the experimentally observable
quantities, e.g., voltage difference, so that the charge current is activated
for values larger than the threshold. The numerical study determines the
threshold of one quantity as a function of the remaining quantities. Our method
and results can serve to guide future experiments in designing circuital
elements, involving this type of random alloy system.

Controlling the properties of quantum materials with light is of fundamental
and technological importance. While high-power lasers may achieve this goal,
more practical strategies aim to exploit the strong coupling of light and
matter in optical cavities, which has recently been shown to affect elemental
physical phenomena, like superconductivity, phase transitions, and topological
protection. Here we report the capacity of strong light-matter coupling to
modify and control the magneto-optical properties of magnets. Tuning the
hybridization of magnetic excitons and cavity photons allows us to realize
distinct optical signatures of external magnetic fields and magnons in the
archetypal van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr. These results highlight
novel directions for cavity-controlled magneto-optics and the manipulation of
quantum material properties by strong light-matter coupling.

<h3>Structure Prediction of Epitaxial Organic Interfaces with Ogre,  Demonstrated for TCNQ on TTF</h3>

Highly ordered epitaxial interfaces between organic semiconductors are
considered as a promising avenue for enhancing the performance of organic
electronic devices including solar cells, light emitting diodes, and
transistors, thanks to their well-controlled, uniform electronic properties and
high carrier mobilities. Although the phenomenon of organic epitaxy has been
known for decades, computational methods for structure prediction of epitaxial
organic interfaces have lagged far behind the existing methods for their
inorganic counterparts. We present a method for structure prediction of
epitaxial organic interfaces based on lattice matching followed by surface
matching, implemented in the open-source Python package, Ogre. The lattice
matching step produces domain-matched interfaces, where commensurability is
achieved with different integer multiples of the substrate and film unit cells.
In the surface matching step, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to find the
interfacial distance and registry between the substrate and film. The BO
objective function is based on dispersion corrected deep neural network
interatomic potentials, shown to be in excellent agreement with density
functional theory (DFT). The application of Ogre is demonstrated for an
epitaxial interface of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) on
tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), whose electronic structure has been probed by
ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), but whose structure had been
hitherto unknown [Organic Electronics 48, 371 (2017)]. We find that TCNQ(001)
on top of TTF(100) is the most stable interface configuration, closely followed
by TCNQ(010) on top of TTF(100). The density of states, calculated using DFT,
is in excellent agreement with UPS, including the presence of an interface
charge transfer state.

<h3>Extended analytical BCS theory of superconductivity in thin films</h3>

<br>
<i>Riccardo Travaglino, Alessio Zaccone</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an analytically solvable theory of BCS-type superconductivity in
good metals which are confined along one of the three spatial directions, such
as thin films. Closed-form expressions for the dependence of the
superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of the confinement
size $L$ are obtained, in quantitative agreement with experimental data with no
adjustable parameters. Upon increasing the confinement, a crossover from a
spherical Fermi surface, which contains two growing hollow spheres
corresponding to states forbidden by confinement, to a strongly deformed Fermi
surface, is predicted. This crossover represents a new topological transition,
driven by confinement, between two Fermi surfaces belonging to two different
homotopy classes. This topological transition provides a mechanistic
explanation of the commonly observed non-monotonic dependence of $T_c$ upon
film thickness with a maximum which, according to our theory, coincides with
the topological transition.

<br>
The interplay between dimensionality and various phases of matter is a
central inquiry in condensed matter physics. New phases are often discovered
through spontaneously broken symmetry. Understanding the dimensionality of
superconductivity in the high-temperature cuprate analogue $-$ layered
nickelates and revealing a new symmetry-breaking state are the keys to
deciphering the underlying pairing mechanism. Here, we demonstrate the
highly-tunable dimensionality and a broken rotational symmetry state in the
superconductivity of square-planar layered nickelates. The superconducting
state, probed by superconducting critical current and magnetoresistance within
superconducting transition under direction-dependent in-plane magnetic fields,
exhibits a $C_2$ rotational symmetry which breaks the $C_4$ rotational symmetry
of the square-planar lattice. Furthermore, by performing detailed examination
of the angular dependent upper critical fields at temperatures down to 0.5 K
with high-magnetic pulsed-fields, we observe a crossover from two-dimensional
to three-dimensional superconducting states which can be manipulated by the
ionic size fluctuations in the rare-earth spacer layer. Such a large degree of
controllability is desired for tailoring strongly two/three-dimensional
superconductors and navigating various pairing landscapes for a better
understanding of the correlation between reduced dimensionality and
unconventional pairing. These results illuminate new directions to unravel the
high-temperature superconducting pairing mechanism.

<br>
In a recent paper it was argued that the random clusters in critical
central-force rigidity percolation (RP) are conformally invariant, and that
their geometric properties are very similar to the ones of the clusters in
connectivity percolation (CP), despite belonging to different universality
classes. In this work we extend these results by providing numerical evidences
that the scaling limit of interfaces in rigidity percolation can be
consistently described by a Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$). Using
well-known relations between different SLE observables and the universal
diffusion constant $\kappa$, we obtain the estimation $\kappa\sim2.82$ for RP.
This value is consistent, through relations coming from conformal field theory,
with previously known values for the clusters' fractal dimension and
correlation length exponent, providing new, non-trivial relations between
critical exponents for RP.

We present a comprehensive study shedding light on how thermal fluctuations
affect correlations in a Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions in one
spatial dimension. The pair correlation function, the static structure factor,
and the one-body density matrix are calculated as a function of the interaction
strength and temperature with the exact ab-initio Path Integral Monte Carlo
method. We explore all possible gas regimes from weak to strong interactions
and from low to high temperatures. We provide a detailed comparison with a
number of theories, such as perturbative (Bogoliubov and decoherent classical),
effective (Luttinger Liquid) and exact (ground-state and thermal Bethe Ansatz)
ones. Our Monte Carlo results exhibit an excellent agreement with the tractable
limits and provide a fundamental benchmark for future observations which can be
achieved in atomic gases, cavity quantum-electrodynamic and

<br>
<br>
The omnipresence of charge density waves (CDWs) across almost all cuprate
families underpins a common organizing principle. However, a longstanding
debate of whether its spatial symmetry is stripe or checkerboard remains
unresolved. While CDWs in lanthanum- and yttrium-based cuprates possess a
stripe symmetry, distinguishing these two scenarios has been challenging for
the short-range CDW in bismuth-based cuprates. Here, we employed
high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to uncover the spatial
symmetry of the CDW in Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$. Across a wide
range of doping and temperature, anisotropic CDW peaks with elliptical shapes
were found in reciprocal space. Based on Fourier transform analysis of
real-space models, we interpret the results as evidence of unidirectional
charge stripes, hosted by mutually 90$^\circ$-rotated anisotropic domains. Our
work paves the way for a unified symmetry and microscopic description of CDW
order in cuprates.

<h3>Probing electron-electron interaction along with superconducting  fluctuations in disordered TiN thin films</h3>

<i>Sachin Yadav, Vinay Kaushik, M.P. Saravanan, Sangeeta Sahoo</i>
<br>
<br>
Here, we demonstrate an interplay between superconducting fluctuations and
electron-electron interaction (EEI) by low temperature magnetotransport
measurements for a set of 2D disordered TiN thin films. While cooling down the
sample, a characteristic temperature T* is obtained from the R(T) at which
superconducting fluctuations start to appear. The upturn in R(T) above T*
corresponds to weak localization (WL) and/or EEI. By the temperature and field
dependences of the observed resistance, we show that the upturn in R(T)
originates mainly from EEI with a negligible contribution from WL. Further, we
have used the modified Larkins electron-electron attraction strength
beta(T/Tc), containing a field induced pair breaking parameter, in the
Maki-Thompson (MT) superconducting fluctuation term. Here, the temperature
dependence of the beta(T/Tc) obtained from the magnetoresistance analysis shows
a diverging behavior close to Tc and it remains almost constant at higher
temperature within the limit of ln(T/Tc) < 1. Interestingly, the variation of
beta(T/Tc) on the reduced temperature (T/Tc) offers a common trend which has
been closely followed by all the concerned samples presented in this study.
Finally, the temperature dependence of inverse phase scattering time , as
obtained from the magnetoresistance analysis, clearly shows two different
regimes; the first one close to Tc follows the Ginzburg-Landau relaxation rate
, whereas, the second one at high temperature varies almost linearly with
temperature indicating the dominance of inelastic electron-electron scattering
for the dephasing mechanism. These two regimes are followed in a generic way by
all the samples in spite of being grown under different growth conditions.

Oxygen vacancy concentrations play a major role in the electric field
assisted abnormal grain growth of technologically relevant polycrystalline
perovskite phases. The underlying effect on the atomic scale is assumed to be a
redistribution of cationic and anionic point defects between grain boundaries
and the bulk interior regions of the grains due to different defect formation
energies in the structurally different regions, accompanied by the formation of
space charge zones. Using atomistic calculations based on classical interatomic
potentials, we derive and discuss optimized structures of the symmetric tilt
grain boundaries $\Sigma$5(210)[001] and $\Sigma$5(310)[001], and of the
asymmetric tilt grain boundary (430)[001]||(100)[001] in the electroceramic
perovskite materials SrTiO$_3$, BaTiO$_3$, and BaZrO$_3$. We present profiles
of oxygen vacancy formation energies across those GBs and discuss their
dependence on composition and grain boundary type.

<h3>Josephson-Current Signatures of Unpaired Floquet Majorana Bound States</h3>

<br>
We theoretically study the transport signatures of unpaired Floquet Majorana
bound states in the Josephson current of weakly linked, periodically driven
topological superconductors. We obtain the occupation of the Floquet Majorana
modes in the presence of weak coupling to thermal leads analytically, and show
that, similar to static superconductors, the Josephson current involving
Floquet Majorana bound states is also $4\pi$-periodic in the phase difference
across the junction, and also depends linearly on the coupling between
superconductors. Moreover, unlike the static case, the amplitude of the
Josephson current can be tuned by setting the unbiased chemical potential of
the driven superconductors at multiple harmonics of the drive frequency. As a
result, we uncover a Josephson Floquet sum rule for driven superconductors. We
confirm our analytical expressions for Josephson current, the occupation of
Floquet bands, and a perturbative analysis of the quasienergies with
numerically exact results.
