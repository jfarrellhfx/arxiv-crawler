<h3>Quantum error correction in a time-dependent transverse field Ising model</h3>

We describe a simple quantum error correcting code built out of a
time-dependent transverse field Ising model. The code is similar to a
repetition code, but has two advantages: an $N$-qubit code can be implemented
with a finite-depth spatially local unitary circuit, and it can subsequently
protect against both $X$ and $Z$ errors if $N\ge 10$ is even. We propose an
implementation of this code with 10 ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical
tweezers, along with further generalizations of the code.

<h3>Fracton magnetohydrodynamics</h3>

We extend recent work on hydrodynamics with global multipolar symmetries --
known as "fracton hydrodynamics" -- to systems in which the multipolar
symmetries are gauged. We refer to the latter as "fracton
magnetohydrodynamics", in analogy to magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which governs
systems with gauged charge conservation. Fracton MHD arises naturally from
higher-rank Maxwell's equations and in systems with one-form symmetries obeying
certain constraints; while we focus on "minimal" higher-rank generalizations of
MHD that realize diffusion, our methods may also be used to identify other,
more exotic hydrodynamic theories (e.g., with magnetic subdiffusion). In
contrast to phenomenological MHD, our approach -- based on higher-form
symmetries -- provides a systematic treatment of hydrodynamics beyond "weak
coupling", and provides an effective hydrodynamic description, e.g., of quantum
spin liquids, whose emergent gauge fields are strongly coupled.
