<h3>Time-reversal symmetries and equilibrium-like Langevin equations</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14255" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14255</a>

Graham has shown in Z. Physik B 26, 397-405 (1977) that a
fluctuation-dissipation relation can be imposed on a class of non-equilibrium
Markovian Langevin equations that admit a stationary solution of the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Here we show that the resulting
equilibrium form of the Langevin equation is associated with a nonequilibrium
Hamiltonian and ask how precisely the broken equilibrium condition manifests
itself therein. We find that this Hamiltonian is not time reversal invariant
and that the "reactive" and "dissipative" fluxes loose their distinct time
reversal symmetries. The antisymmetric coupling matrix between forces and
fluxes no longer originates from Poisson brackets and the "reactive" fluxes
contribute to the ("housekeeping") entropy production, in the steady state. The
time-reversal even and odd parts of the nonequilibrium Hamiltonian contribute
in qualitatively different but physically instructive ways to the entropy.
Finally, this structure gives rise to a new, physically pertinent instance of
frenesy.

Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are described by symmetric
exponentially decayed Wannier functions at some $necessary$ unoccupied Wyckoff
positions and classified as obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) in the
topological quantum chemistry (TQC) theory. The boundary states in HOTIs
reported so far are often fragile, manifested as strongly depending on
crystalline symmetries and cleavage terminations in the disk or cylinder
geometry. Here, using the TQC theory, we present an intuitive argument about
the connection between the obstructed Wannier charge centers of OAIs and the
emergence of robust corner states in two-dimensional systems. Based on
first-principles calculations and Real Space Invariant theory, we extend the
concept of OAIs to phonon systems and thereby predict that the robust corner
states can be realized in the phonon spectra of $MX_3$ ($M$=Bi, Sb, As, Sc, Y;
$X$=I, Br, Cl) monolayers. The phonon corner modes in different shapes of
nano-disks are investigated, and their robustness facilitates the detection in
experiments and further applications. This work suggests a promising avenue to
explore more attractive features of higher-order band topology.

<h3>Charge transport, information scrambling and quantum operator-coherence  in a many-body system with U(1) symmetry</h3>

In this work, we derive an exact hydrodynamical description for the coupled,
charge and operator dynamics, in a quantum many-body system with U(1) symmetry.
Using an emergent symmetry in the complex Brownian SYK model with charge
conservation, we map the operator dynamics in the model to the imaginary-time
dynamics of an SU(4) spin-chain. We utilize the emergent SU(4) description to
demonstrate that the U(1) symmetry causes quantum-coherence to persist even
after disorder-averaging, in sharp contrast to models without symmetries. In
line with this property, we write down a 'restricted' Fokker-Plank equation for
the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) in the large-N limit, which permits a
classical probability description strictly in the incoherent sector of the
global operator-space. We then exploit this property to describe the OTOC in
terms of a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskun (FKPP)-equation which couples the
operator with the charge and is valid at all time-scales and for arbitrary
charge-density profiles. Following this, we simulate the coupled equations of
motion and explore operator-dynamics in a background of non-uniform charge
configuration. We find that the charge transport can strongly affect dynamics
of operators, including those that have no overlap with the charge.

<h3>Bipolaronic superconductivity out of a Coulomb gas</h3>

Employing unbiased sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate the
effects of long-range Coulomb forces on BEC of bipolarons using a model of bond
phonon-modulated electron hopping. In absence of long-range repulsion, this
model was recently shown to give rise to small-size, light-mass bipolarons that
undergo a superfluid transition at high values of the critical transition
temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. We find that $T_\mathrm{c}$ in our model even with
the long-range Coulomb repulsion remains much larger than that of Holstein
bipolarons, and can be on the order of or greater than the typical upper bounds
on phonon-mediated $T_\mathrm{c}$ based on the Migdal-Eliashberg and McMillan
approximations. Our work points to a physically simple mechanism for
superconductivity in the low-density regime that may be relevant to current
experiments on dilute superconductors.

<h3>Ingredients for Generalized Models of $Îº$-Phase Organic  Charge-Transfer Salts: A Review</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14251" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14251</a>

The families of organic charge-transfer salts $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2X$ and
$\kappa$-(BETS)$_2X$ have proven to serve as a powerful playground for the
investigation of the physics of frustrated Mott insulators. These materials
have been ascribed model character, since dimerization of the organic molecules
allows to map these materials onto a single band Hubbard model, in which the
dimers reside on an anisotropic triangular lattice. By changing the inorganic
unit $X$ or applying physical pressure, the correlation strength and anisotropy
of the triangular lattice can be varied. This has lead to the discovery of a
variety of exotic phenomena, including quantum spin liquid states, a plethora
of long-range magnetic orders in proximity to a Mott metal-insulator
transition, and unconventional superconductivity. While many of these phenomena
can be described within this effective one-band Hubbard model on a triangular
lattice, it became evident in recent years that this simplified description is
insufficient to capture all observed magnetic and electronic properties. The
ingredients for generalized models that are relevant include, but are not
limited to, spin-orbit coupling, intra-dimer charge and spin degrees of
freedom, electron-lattice coupling, as well as disorder effects. Here, we
review selected theoretical and experimental discoveries that clearly
demonstrate the relevance thereof. At the same time, we outline that these
aspects are not only relevant to this class of organic charge-transfer salts,
but are also receiving increasing attention in other classes of inorganic
strongly correlated electron systems. This reinforces the model character that
the $\kappa$-phase organic charge-transfer salts have for understanding and
discovering novel phenomena in strongly correlated electron systems from a
theoretical and experimental point of view.

Massless Dirac fermions have been observed in various materials such as
graphene and topological insulators in recent years, thus offering a
solid-state platform to study relativistic quantum phenomena. Single quantum
dots (QDs) and coupled QDs formed with massless Dirac fermions can be viewed as
artificial relativistic atoms and molecules, respectively. Such structures
offer a unique platform to study atomic and molecular physics in the
ultra-relativistic regime. Here, we use a scanning tunneling microscope to
create and probe single and coupled electrostatically defined graphene QDs to
unravel the unique magnetic field responses of artificial relativistic
nanostructures. Giant orbital Zeeman splitting and orbital magnetic moment are
observed in single graphene QDs. While for coupled graphene QDs, Aharonov Bohm
oscillations and strong Van Vleck paramagnetic shift are observed. Such
properties of artificial relativistic atoms and molecules can be leveraged for
novel magnetic field sensing modalities.

We discuss the microscopical justification of dissipation in the model
nonrelativistic Fermi and Bose systems with weak local interactions above phase
transitions. The dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations are considered in Keldysh
- Schwinger framework. We show that the dissipation is related to pinch
singularities of the diagram technique. Using Dyson - Schwinger equation and
the two-loop approximation we define and calculate the attenuation parameter
which is related to exponentiality of Green's functions decay. We show that the
attenuation parameter is the microscopic analogue of the Onsager kinetic
coefficient and it is related to attenuation in the excitation spectrum.

<h3>Topological phase transitions and Berry-phase hysteresis in  exchange-coupled nanomagnets</h3>

Topological phase in magnetic materials yields a quantized contribution to
the Hall effect known as the topological Hall effect, which is often caused by
skyrmions, with each skyrmion creating a magnetic flux quantum h/e. The control
and understanding of topological properties in nanostructured materials is the
subject of immense interest for both fundamental science and technological
applications, especially in spintronics. In this work, the electron-transport
properties and spin structure of exchange-coupled cobalt nanoparticles with an
average particle size of 13.7 nm are studied experimentally and theoretically.
Magnetic and Hall-effect measurements identify topological phase transitions in
the exchange-coupled cobalt nanoparticles and were used to discover a
qualitatively new type of hysteresis in the topological Hall effect namely,
Berry-phase hysteresis. Micromagnetic simulations reveal the origin of the
topological Hall effect namely, the chiral domains, with domain-wall chirality
quantified by an integer skyrmion number. These spin structures are different
from the skyrmions formed due to Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interactions in B20
crystals and multilayered thin films, and caused by cooperative magnetization
reversal in the exchange-coupled cobalt nanoparticles. An analytical model is
developed to explain the underlying physics of Berry-phase hysteresis, which is
strikingly different from the iconic magnetic hysteresis and constitutes one
aspect of 21st-century reshaping of our view on nature at the borderline of
physics, chemistry, mathematics, and materials science.

<h3>Field-induced spin level crossings within a quasi-XY antiferromagnetic  state in Ba$_{2}$FeSi$_{2}$O$_{7}$</h3>

<br>
We present a high-field study of the strongly anisotropic easy-plane square
lattice {\bf S} = 2 quantum magnet Ba$_{2}$FeSi$_{2}$O$_{7}$. This compound is
a rare high-spin antiferromagnetic system with very strong easy-plane
anisotropy, such that the interplay between spin level crossings and
antiferromagnetic order can be studied. We observe a magnetic field-induced
spin level crossing occurring within an ordered state. This spin level crossing
appears to preserve the magnetic symmetry while producing a non-monotonic
dependence the order parameter magnitude due to a spin level crossing. The
resulting temperature-magnetic field phase diagram exhibits two dome-shaped
regions overlapping around 30 T. The ground state of the lower-field dome is
predominantly a linear combination of $| S^{z} = 0 \rangle$ and $ |S^{z} = 1
\rangle$ states, while the ground state of the higher-field dome can be
approximated by a linear combination of $| S^{z} = 1 \rangle $ and $ | S^{z} =
2\rangle$ states. At 30 T, where the spin levels cross, the magnetization
exhibits a slanted plateau. We determined the detailed magnetic phase
boundaries and the spin level crossings using measurements of magnetization,
electric polarization, and the magnetocaloric effect in pulsed magnetic fields
to 60 T. We calculate these properties using a mean field theory based on
direct products of SU(5) coherent states and find good agreement. Finally, we
measure and calculate the magnetically-induced electric polarization that
reflects magnetic ordering and spin level crossings. This multiferroic behavior
provides another avenue for detecting phase boundaries and symmetry changes.

<h3>Electric field-induced interfacial instability in a ferroelectric  nematic liquid crystal</h3>

Studies of sessile droplets and fluid bridges of a ferroelectric nematic
liquid crystal in externally applied electric fields are presented. It is found
that above a threshold a fingering instability occurs, resembling to
Rayleigh-type instability observed in charged droplets in electric fields or
circular drop-type instabilities observed in ferromagnetic liquids in magnetic
field. The frequency dependence of the threshold voltage was determined in
various geometries. The nematic director and ferroelectric polarization
direction was found to point along the tip of the fingers that appear to repel
each other, indicating that the ferroelectric polarization is essentially
parallel to the director. The results are interpreted in analogy to the
Rayleigh and circular drop-type instabilities.

<h3>Enhanced mobility of dislocation network nodes and its effect on  dislocation multiplication and storage</h3>

Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) is a mesoscopic computational approach to
predicting crystal plasticity and strength. The method's key premise is that,
to the extent each individual dislocation in the model knows how to respond to
stress, crystal plasticity should emerge in all its realistic complexity by
letting a statistically representative ensemble of dislocations interact and
collectively evolve in response to deformation. DDD integrates much of the
dislocation theory developed over nearly 90 years, and yet exactly how
dislocations behave in a plastically flowing crystal had been hidden for our
inability to resolve dislocation motion in full atomistic details. Fast forward
to the present, large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are emerging as
an alternative to DDD for predicting crystal plasticity. Where feasible, MD
simulations are unsurpassed in providing most detailed insights into the
physics of material deformation and, whereas a DDD model only knows of
dislocation behaviors that its developers knew to implement, MD uncovers
mechanisms not anticipated a priori. Cross-comparison between DDD and MD
simulations performed under identical conditions exposes glaring discrepancies
in predicted strength and microstructure evolution. Deeper inquiry pins the
observed discrepancies to contrasting behaviors of network nodes - dislocation
intersections. Whereas in DDD the nodes strongly restrict dislocation motion,
in atomistic simulations the same nodes enable networked dislocations to move
in ways previously thought impossible and not permitted in DDD. Only after base
kinematic rules are extended to include previously unaccounted freedoms of
dislocation motion, DDD simulations fall closely in line with the "ground
truth" atomistic simulations.

<h3>A computational model of twisted elastic ribbons</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14374" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14374</a>

We develop an irregular lattice mass-spring-model (MSM) to simulate and study
the deformation modes of a thin elastic ribbon as a function of applied
end-to-end twist and tension. Our simulations reproduce all reported
experimentally observed modes, including transitions from helicoids to
longitudinal wrinkles, creased helicoids and loops with self-contact, and
transverse wrinkles to accordion self-folds. Our simulations also show that the
twist angles at which the primary longitudinal and transverse wrinkles appear
are well described by various analyses of the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an (FvK)
equations, but the characteristic wavelength of the longitudinal wrinkles has a
more complex relationship to applied tension than previously estimated. The
clamped edges are shown to suppress longitudinal wrinkling over a distance on
the order of the ribbon width, but otherwise have no apparent effect on
measured wavelength. Further, by analyzing the stress profile, we find that
longitudinal wrinkling does not completely alleviate compression, but rather
caps the magnitude of the compression. Nonetheless, the width over which
wrinkles form is observed to be wider than the near-threshold analysis
predictions; the width is more consistent with the predictions of
far-from-threshold analysis, even though it assumes negligible compression.
However, the end-to-end contraction of the ribbon as a function of twist is
found to more closely follow the corresponding near-threshold prediction as
tension in the ribbon is increased, in contrast to the far-from-threshold
analysis. These results point to the need for further theoretical analysis of
this rich thin elastic system, guided by our physically robust and intuitive
simulation model.

<h3>Ab-initio Prediction of Ultra-Wide Band Gap B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N Materials</h3>

Ultra-wide band gap (UWBG) materials are poised to play an important role in
the future of power electronics. Devices made from UWBG materials are expected
to operate at higher voltages, high frequencies, and high temperatures than
current silicon and silicon carbide based devices; and can even lead to
significant miniaturization of such devices. In the UWBG field, aluminum
nitride and boron nitride have attracted great interest, however, the
B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys are much less studied. In this article, using
first-principles simulations combining density-functional theory and cluster
expansion method we predict the crystal structure of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N alloys.
We find 17 ground state structures of B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N with formation energies
between 0.11 and 0.25 eV/atom. All of these structures are found to be
dynamically stable. The B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures are found to have
predominantly a tetrahedral bonding environment, however, some structures
exhibit $sp^2$ bonds similar to hexagonal BN. This work expands our knowledge
of the structures, energies and bonding in B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N aiding their
synthesis, innovation of lateral or vertical devices, and discovery of
compatible dielectric and Ohmic contact materials.

<h3>Dissolution Dynamics of a Binary Switchable Hydrophilicty Solvent --  Polymer Drop into an Acidic Aqueous Phase</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14398" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14398</a>

Switchable hydrophilicity solvents (SHSs) are solvents defined by their
ability to switch from their hydrophobic form to a hydrophilic form when put in
contact with an acidic trigger such as $CO_2$. As a consequence, SHSs qualify
as promising alternatives to volatile organic compounds during the industrial
solvent extraction processes, as greener and inexpensive methods can be applied
to separate and recover SHSs. Furthermore, because of their less volatile
nature, SHSs are less flammable and so increase the safety of a larger-scale
extraction process. In this work, we study the dynamics and in-drop phase
separation during the dissolution process of a drop composed of SHS and
polymer, triggered by an acid in the surrounding aqueous environment. From 70
different experimental conditions, we found a scaling relationship between the
drop dissolution time and initial volume with an overall scaling coefficient
$\sim$ 0.53. We quantitatively assessed and found a shorter dissolution time
related with a decrease in pH of the aqueous phase or an increase in initial
polymer concentration in the drop. Examining the internal state of the drop
during the dissolution revealed an in-drop phase separation behavior, resulting
in a porous morphology of the final polymer particle. Our experimental results
provide a microscopic view of the SHS dissolution process from droplets, and
findings may help design SHS extraction processes for particle formation from
emulsions.

Intrinsic inelastic losses in x-ray spectra originate from excitations in an
interacting electron system due to a suddenly created core-hole. These losses
characterize the features observed in x-ray photoemission spectra (XPS), as
well Here we present a complementary {\it ab initio} real-space Green's
function (RSGF) generalization of the Langreth cumulant in terms of the
dynamically screened core-hole interaction $W_c(\omega)$ and the independent
particle response function. We find that the cumulant kernel $\beta(\omega)$ is
analogous to XAS, but with the transition operator replaced by the core-hole
potential with monopole selection rules. The behavior reflects the analytic
structure of the loss function, with peaks near the zeros of the dielectric
function, consistent with delocalized quasi-boson excitations. The approach
simplifies when $W_c(\omega)$ is localized and spherically symmetric.
Illustrative results and comparisons are presented for the electron gas,
sodium, and some early transition metal compounds.

<h3>Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$: Interplay among degrees of freedom and the role  of the exchange-correlation</h3>

<br>
<br>
Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ is a fascinating material that displays physical
properties governed by spin-orbit interactions and structural distortions,
showing a wide range of remarkable electronic phenomena. Here, we present a
density-functional-based analysis of the interplay among degrees of freedom,
such as magnetism, Coulomb repulsion (Hubbard-U), and lattice degree of
freedom, together with clarifying the role of the exchange-correlation effects
(LDA v/s PBEsol functional). Our goal is twofold: first, to provide a brief
overview of the current state of the art on this compound underpinning to last
proposed theoretical models and experimental research, and second, to give
another view to model the electronic properties compared with the previous
theoretical models, establishing the lower and upper limits of (Hubbard-U).
Furthermore, disentangle the effect of the Coulomb repulsion, structure, and
functional approximation on the electronic band structure. Our findings show
that local-density approximations (LDA) exchange-correlation outperforms the
generalized gradient approximations (GGA-PBE); the Hubbard-U term in range
($0.2 \leq U \leq 2.0$ eV) for LDA+U accurately reproduces the structural and
electronic properties of Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$.

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising channel materials for
continued downscaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic
circuits. However, their full potential continues to be limited by a lack of
scalable high-k dielectrics that can achieve atomically smooth interfaces,
small equivalent oxide thicknesses (EOT), excellent gate control, and low
leakage currents. Here, we report liquid metal printed ultrathin and scalable
Ga2O3 dielectric for 2D electronics and electro-optical devices. We directly
visualize the atomically smooth Ga2O3/WS2 interfaces enabled by the conformal
nature of liquid metal printing. We demonstrate atomic layer deposition
compatibility with high-k Ga2O3/HfO2 top-gate dielectric stacks on chemical
vapour deposition grown monolayer WS2, achieving EOTs of ~1 nm and subthreshold
swings down to 84.9 mV/dec. Gate leakage currents are well within requirements
for ultra-scaled low-power logic circuits. Our results show that liquid metal
printed oxides can bridge a crucial gap in scalable dielectric integration of
2D materials for next-generation nano-electronics.

Theoretical investigation is conducted of high-order harmonic generation
(HHG) in silicon thin films to elucidate the effect of light propagation in
reflected and transmitted waves. The first-principles simulations are performed
of the process in which an intense pulsed light irradiates silicon thin films
up to 3 $\mu$m thickness. Our simulations are carried within the time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) with the account of coupled dynamics of the
electromagnetic fields and the electronic motion. It was found that the
intensity of transmission HHG gradually decreases with the thickness, while the
reflection HHG becomes constant from a certain thickness. Detailed analyses
show that transmission HHG have two origins: the HHG generated near the front
edge and propagating to the back surface, and that generated near the back edge
and emitted directly. The dominating mechanism of the transmission HHG is found
to depend on the thickness of the thin film and the frequency of the HHG. At
the film thickness of 1 $\mu$m, the transmission HHG with the frequency below
20 eV is generated near the back edge, while that with the frequency above 20
eV is generated near the front edge and propagates from there to the back
surface.

external stimuli have strong influences on the (de)localization of the
interfacial two-dimensional (2D) electrons, these factors alone could not fully
account for the system's charge dynamics where interfacial hybridization holds
very strong influence.Here, we determine that the displaced 2D free electrons
are localized in the specific hybridized states at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3(LAO/STO)
interface.This experimental study combines both transport measurements and
temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy and suggests the
localization of 2D electrons can be induced via temperature reduction or ionic
liquid gating and it applies to both amorphous and crystalline interfacial
systems.Specifically, we demonstrate that interfacial hybridization plays a
pivotal role in regulating the 2D electron localization effects.Our study
resolves the location where the 2D electrons are localized and highlights the
importance of interfacial hybridization and opens further scientific
investigation of its influence on 2D charge localization in oxide
heterointerfaces.

BaCo2(AsO4)2, or BCAO, has seen extensive study since its initial
identification as a proximate Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) candidate.
Although recent studies suggest its magnetic ground state is better described
by the highly anisotropic XXZ-J_1-J_3 model, the ease with which magnetic order
is suppressed with the application of a small in-plane magnetic field indicates
proximity to a spin liquid phase. Upon chemical tuning via partial arsenic
substitution with vanadium, we show an initial suppression of long-range order
in the BCAO system to T ~ 3.0 K, followed by the introduction of increased spin
freezing at higher substitution levels. Between these two regions at 10%
nominal substitution, the system is shown via AC and DC susceptibility, Raman
scattering spectroscopy, and heat capacity measurements to pass through a
critical point where no phase transition is apparent, down to T = 0.40 K. At
this level of substitution, the competing nearest-neighbor J_1 and third
nearest-neighbor J_3 interactions apparently become more balanced, producing a
more complex magnetic ground state, likely stabilized by quantum fluctuations.
This state shows how slight compositional change in magnetically-frustrated
systems may be leveraged to tune ground state degeneracies and potentially
realize a quantum spin liquid state.

Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite oxide interfaces are ideal systems where
diverse emergent properties can be uncovered.The formation and modification of
polaronic properties due to short-range strong charge-lattice interactions of
2D interfaces remains hugely intriguing.Here, we report the direct observation
of small-polarons at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) conducting interface using
high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry.First-principles investigations
further reveals that strong coupling between the interfacial electrons and the
Ti-lattice result in the formation of localized 2D small polarons.These
findings resolve the longstanding issue where the excess experimentally
measured interfacial carrier density is significantly lower than theoretically
predicted values.The charge-phonon induced lattice distortion further provides
an analogue to the superconductive states in magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene attributed to the many-body correlations induced by broken periodic
lattice symmetry.Our study sheds light on the multifaceted complexity of broken
periodic lattice induced quasi-particle effects and its relationship with
superconductivity.

Understanding the transport of photogenerated charge carriers in
semiconductors is crucial for applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics
and photo-detectors. While recent experimental studies using scanning ultrafast
electron microscopy (SUEM) have demonstrated that the local change in the
secondary electron emission induced by photoexcitation enables direct
visualization of the photocarrier dynamics in space and time, the origin of the
corresponding image contrast still remains unclear. Here, we investigate the
impact of photoexcitation on secondary electron emissions from semiconductors
using a Monte Carlo simulation aided by time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT). Particularly, we examine two photo-induced effects: the
generation of photo-carriers in the sample bulk, and the surface photovoltage
(SPV) effect. Using doped silicon as a model system and focusing on primary
electron energies below 1 keV, we found that both the hot photocarrier effect
immediately after photoexcitation and the SPV effect play dominant roles in
changing the secondary electron yield (SEY), while the distribution of
photocarriers in the bulk leads to a negligible change in SEY. Our work
provides insights into electron-matter interaction under photo-illumiation and
paves the way towards a quantitative interpretation of the SUEM contrasts.

The numerical value of a universal quantity associated with the quantum
critical regime, namely $\chi_u c^2/T$, for a two-dimensional (2D) dimerized
spin-1/2 antiferromagnet is calculated using the quantum Monte Carlo
simulations (QMC). Here $\chi_u$, $c$, and $T$ are the uniform susceptibility,
the spin-wave velocity, and the temperature, respectively. By simulating large
lattices at moderately low temperatures, we find $\chi_u c^2/T \sim 0.32$. Our
estimation of $\chi_u c^2/T$ deviates from the related analytic prediction but
agrees with recent numerical calculations of other 2D dimerized spin-1/2
antiferromagnets.

Ionic liquids (ILs), also known as room-temperature molten salts, are
composed of pure ions with melting points usually below 100 degrees centigrade.
Because of their low volatility and vast amounts of species, ILs can serve as
"green solvents" and "designer solvents" to meet the requirements of various
applications by fine tuning their molecular structures. A good understanding of
the phase behaviors of ILs is certainly fundamentally important in terms of
their wide applications. This review intends to summarize the major conclusions
so far drawn on phase behaviors of ILs by computational, theoretical, and
experimental studies, illustrating the intrinsic relationship between their
dual ionic and organic nature and the crystalline phases, nanoscale segregation
liquid phase, ionic liquid crystal phases, as well as phase behaviors of their
mixture with small organic molecules.

<h3>Quantum-to-Classical Crossover in Single-electron Emitter</h3>

We investigate the temperature-driven quantum-to-classical crossover in a
single-electron emitter. The emitter is composed of a quantum conductor and an
electrode, which is coupled via an Ohmic contact. At zero temperature, it has
been shown that a single electron can be injected coherently by applying an
unit-charge Lorentzian pulse on the electrode. As the electrode temperature
increases, we show that the electron emission approaches a time-dependence
Poisson process at long times. The Poissonian character is demonstrated from
the time-resolved full counting statistics. In the meantime, we show that the
emission events remain correlated, which is due to the Pauli exclusion
principle. The correlation is revealed from the emission rates of individual
electrons, from which a characteristic correlation time can be extracted. The
correlation time drops rapidly as the electrode temperature increases,
indicating that correlation can only play a non-negligible role at short times
in the high-temperature limit. By using the same procedure, we further show
that the quantum-to-classical crossover exhibits similar features when the
emission is driven by a Lorentzian pulse carrying two electron charge. Our
results show how the electron emission process is affected by thermal
fluctuations in a single-electron emitter.

<br>
<br>
At a certain "magic" relative twist angle of two graphene sheets it remains a
challenge to obtain a detailed description of the proliferation of correlated
topological electronic phases and their filling-dependence. We perform a
self-consistent real-space Hartree-Fock study of an effective moir{\'e} lattice
model to map out the preferred ordered phases as a function of Coulomb
interaction strength and moir{\'e} flat-band filling factor. It is found that a
quantum valley Hall phase, previously discovered at charge neutrality, is
present at all integer fillings for sufficiently large interactions. However,
except from charge neutrality additional spontaneous spin/valley polarization
is present in the ground state at nonzero integer fillings, leading to
Chern-insulator phases and anomalous quantum Hall effects at odd filling
factors, thus constituting an example of interaction-driven nontrivial
topology. At weaker interactions, all nonzero integer fillings feature metallic
inhomogeneous spin/valley ordered phases which may also break additional point
group symmetries of the system. We discuss these findings in the light of
previous theoretical studies and recent experimental developments of
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene.

MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is a promising representative of intrinsic antiferromagnetic
topological insulators, which could enable rare quantum mechanical effects like
the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Especially at low temperatures, numerous
studies have been reported, demonstrating the great potential of this compound
in the magnetically ordered state below $T_{\mathrm{N}}$. Among recent
findings, the alloy compound Mn(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_4$ has been suggested
to be an interesting candidate for the realization of an ideal Weyl semimetal
state. By exchanging Bi by Sb, the electronic structure is influenced in terms
of a shift of the Fermi energy, and a decrease in the energy gap has been
predicted. In this work, we investigate and compare the optical conductivity of
Mn(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_4$ single crystals with various Sb doping levels
$x$ by infrared reflectivity measurements. We observe a big impact of the Sb
content on the low-energy excitations characterizing the metallic state of our
samples. Different $x$=0.26 crystals show significant differences in their
optical response and also a strong position dependence. The findings are
compared to the recently reported optical conductivity spectrum of the pure
compound MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.

<h3>On the effective reconstruction of expectation values from ab initio  quantum embedding</h3>

Quantum embedding is an appealing route to fragment a large interacting
quantum system into several smaller auxiliary `cluster' problems to exploit the
locality of the correlated physics. In this work we critically review
approaches to recombine these fragmented solutions in order to compute
non-local expectation values, including the total energy. Starting from the
democratic partitioning of expectation values used in density matrix embedding
theory, we motivate and develop a number of alternative approaches, numerically
demonstrating their efficiency and improved accuracy as a function of
increasing cluster size for both energetics and non-local two-body observables
in molecular and solid state systems. These approaches consider the
$N$-representability of the resulting expectation values via an implicit global
wave~function across the clusters, as well as the importance of including
contributions to expectation values spanning multiple fragments simultaneously,
thereby alleviating the fundamental locality approximation of the embedding. We
clearly demonstrate the value of these introduced functionals for reliable
extraction of observables and robust and systematic convergence as the cluster
size increases, allowing for significantly smaller clusters to be used for a
desired accuracy compared to traditional approaches in ab initio wave~function
quantum embedding.

<h3>The development of food protein-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers with  outstanding role in stabilizing natural pigments</h3>

<br>
Protein-inorganic hybrid nanoflowers (HNFs) possess unique properties in
promoting surface reaction and have attracted wide-spread attention as a newly
developed nanomaterial. However, the availability of protein sources has up to
now been mostly limited to enzymes, which narrows the application of HNFs
especially in food industry. Here we show that for many types of food protein,
enzymatic hydrolysis can improve its ability to form versatile HNFs, or even
induce HNF formation where the protein source did not show its formation a
priori. The treatment of enzymatic hydrolysis increases the flexibility of such
proteins and induces nucleation sites of HNFs in the early formation stage by
decomposing those proteins into polypeptides. In particular, the HNF prepared
with soy protein hydrolysate further shows a high loading capacity of
water-soluble Monascus red, reaching up to 554.1 mg per gram of HNF. Its
stabilization towards lipophilic curcumin is similarly impressive with the
loading capacity reaching 21.9 mg per gram of HNF. This HNF could also
effectively protect these two sensitive natural pigments in harsh environments.
This research significantly broadens the available protein source for HNF
fabrication and demonstrates the potential of HNFs as novel protein-based
delivery systems - especially for sensitive natural pigments - which could
serve the fields of food, cosmetic and medicine.

<h3>Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in two-dimensional XXZ model with  or without SU(2) symmetry</h3>

We investigate the eigenstate thermalization properties of the spin-1/2 XXZ
model in the two-dimensional rectangular lattices of size $L_1\times L_2$ under
the periodic boundary conditions. Exploiting the symmetry property, we can
perform the exact diagonalization study of the energy eigenvalues up to system
size $4\times 7$ and of the energy eigenstates up to $4\times 6$. Numerical
analysis of the Hamiltonian eigenvalue spectrum and matrix elements of an
observable in the Hamiltonian eigenstate basis supports that the
two-dimensional XXZ model follows the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.
When the spin interaction is isotropic the XXZ model Hamiltonian conserves the
total spin and has the SU(2) symmetry. We show that the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis is still valid within each subspace where the total
spin is a good quantum number.

The versatility of properties displayed by two-dimensional electron gases
(2DEGs) at oxide interfaces has fostered intense research in hope of achieving
exotic electromagnetic effects in confined systems. Of particular interest is
the recently discovered superconducting state appearing in (111)-oriented
KTaO$_3$ interfaces, with a critical temperature $T_c \approx 2$ K, almost ten
times higher than that of SrTiO$_3$-based 2DEGs. Just as in SrTiO$_3$-based
2DEGs, fabricating devices in this new system is a technical challenge due to
the fragility of the 2DEG and the propensity of bulk KTaO$_3$ to become
conducting outside the devices upon adventitious oxygen vacancy doping. Here,
we present three different techniques for patterning Hall bars in
AlO$_x$/KTaO$_3$~(111) heterostructures. The devices show superconducting
transitions ranging from 1.3 K to 1.78 K, with limited degradation from the
unpatterned thin film, and enable an efficient tuning of the carrier density by
electric field effect. The array of techniques allows for the definition of
channels with a large range of dimensions for the design of various kinds of
devices to explore the properties of this system down to the nanoscale.

<br>
<br>
We consider interacting bosonic particles on a two-leg triangular ladder in
the presence of an artificial gauge field. We employ density matrix
renormalization group numerical simulations and analytical bosonization
calculations to study the rich phase diagram of this system. We show that the
interplay between the frustration induced by the triangular lattice geometry
and the interactions gives rise to multiple chiral quantum phases. Phase
transition between superfluid to Mott-insulating states occur, which can have
Meissner or vortex character. Furthermore, a state that explicitly breaks the
symmetry between the two legs of the ladder, the biased chiral superfluid, is
found for values of the flux close to $\pi$. In the regime of hardcore bosons,
we show that the extension of the bond order insulator beyond the case of the
fully frustrated ladder exhibits Meissner-type chiral currents. We discuss the
consequences of our findings for experiments in cold atomic systems.

We apply the Halperin-Mazenco formalism within the Gross-Pitaevskii theory to
characterise the kinematics and nucleation of quantum vortices in a
two-dimensional stirred Bose Einstein condensate. We introduce a smooth defect
density field measuring the superfluid vorticity and is a topologically
conserved quantity. We use this defect density field and its associated current
density to study the precursory pattern formations that occur inside the
repulsive potential of an obstacle and determine the onset of vortex nucleation
and shedding. We demonstrate that phase slips form inside hard potentials even
in the absence of vortex nucleation, whereas for soft potentials they occur
only above a critical stirring velocity leading to vortex nucleation. The
Halperin-Mazenco formalism provides an elegant and accurate method of deriving
the point vortex dynamic directly from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

1T-TiSe2 is one of the most studied charge density wave (CDW) systems, not
only because of its peculiar properties related to the CDW transition, but also
due to its status as a promising candidate of exciton insulator signaled by the
proposed plasmon softening at the CDW wave vector. Using high-resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy, we report a systematic study of the
temperature-dependent plasmon behaviors of 1T-TiSe2. We unambiguously resolve
the plasmon from phonon modes, revealing the existence of Landau damping to the
plasmon at finite momentums, which does not support the plasmon softening
picture for exciton condensation. Moreover, we discover that the plasmon
lifetime at zero momentum responds dramatically to the bandgap evolution
associated with the CDW transition. The interband transitions near the Fermi
energy in the normal phase is demonstrated serving as a strong damping channel
of plasmons, while such a channel in the CDW phase is suppressed due to the CDW
gap opening, which results in the dramatic tunability of the plasmon in
semimetals or small-gap semiconductors.

Lithium-graphite intercalation compounds (Li-GICs) are the most common anode
material for modern Li-ion batteries. However, the dielectric response of this
material in the electrostatic limit (and its variation with the state of charge
(SOC)) has not been investigated to a satisfactory degree, especially not for
the higher SOC range. Nevertheless, said dielectric behaviour is a highly
desired property, particularly as an input parameter for charged kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations, one of the most promising modeling techniques for energy
materials. In this work, we employ our recent DFTB parametrization for Li-GICs
based on a machine-learned repulsive potential in order to overcome the
computational hurdles of sampling the long-ranged Coulomb interactions within
this material, as experienced by the charge carriers within. This approach is
rather novel due to computational cost, but best suited for investigating our
specific property of interest. For the first time, we discover a mostly linear
dependency of the relative permittivity on the SOC, from ca. 7 at SOC 0% to ca.
25 at SOC 100%. In doing so, we also present a straightforward approach that
can be used in future research for other intercalation compounds -- once
sufficiently fast and long-ranged computational methods, e.g. linear-scaling
DFT, a good DFTB parametrization, or atomic potentials with inbuilt
electrostatics, become available. However, while the presented qualitative
behaviour is robust and our results compare favourably with the few
experimental studies available, we stress that quantitative results are
strongly dependent on our estimation of the partial charge transfer from the
intercalated Li-ion to the carbon host structure, and need to be verified by
further experiments and calculations. Yet, our research shows that in
principle, two measurements -- one at low and one at high SOC -- should suffice
for that purpose.

We have investigated magnetic interactions between transition metal ions in
bismuthene topological insulator with protected edge states. We find that these
topological states have a crucial role on the magnetic interactions in 2D
topological insulators. Using first-principles and model Hamiltonian we make a
comparative study of transition metal doped bulk and nanoribbon bismuthene.
While direct overlap between the transition metal prevails in gapped bulk
bismuthene, at the borders of nanoribbons a long-range magnetism is present.
The exchange interactions are well described by a RKKY-like Hamiltonian
mediated by topological states. Our results show a dominance of
antiferromagnetism promoted by the topological states, preserving the
spin-locked Dirac crossing states due to a global time-reversal symmetry
preservation. This extended magnetic interactions mediated by massless
electrons can increase the spin diffusion length being promising for fast
dissipationless spintronic devices.

Weyl semimetals are well known for their anomalous transport effects caused
by a large fictitious magnetic field generated by the non-zero Berry curvature.
We performed the analysis of the electrical transport measurements of the
magnetic Weyl semimetal Mn$_{3}$Ge in the a-b and a-c plane. We have observed
negative longitudinal magneto-resistance (LMR) at a low magnetic field ($B<1.5$
T) along all the axes. The high field LMR shows different behavior along x and
z axes. A similar trend has been observed in the case of planar Hall effect
(PHE) measurements as well. The nature of high field LMR along the x axis
changes near 200 K. Dominant carrier concentration type, and metallic to
semimetallic transition also occur near 200 K. These observations suggest two
main conclusions: (i) The high field LMR in Mn$_3$Ge is driven by the metallic
- semimetallic nature of the compound. (ii) Mn$_3$Ge compound goes through an
electronic band topological transition near 200 K. Single crystal neutron
diffraction does not show any change in the magnetic structure below 300 K.
However, the in-plane lattice parameter (a) shows a maximum near 230 K.
Therefore, it is possible that the change in electronic band structure near 200
K is driven by the a lattice parameter of the compound.

Recent mathematical investigations have shown that under very general
conditions exponential mixing implies the Bernoulli property. As a concrete
example of a statistical mechanics which is exponentially mixing we consider a
Bernoulli shift dynamics by Chebyshev maps of arbitrary order $N\geq 2$, which
maximizes Tsallis $q=3$ entropy rather than the ordinary $q=1$ Boltzmann-Gibbs
entropy. Such an information shift dynamics may be relevant in a pre-universe
before ordinary space-time is created. We discuss symmetry properties of the
coupled Chebyshev systems, which are different for even and odd $N$. We show
that the value of the fine structure constant $\alpha_{el}=1/137$ is
distinguished as a coupling constant in this context, leading to uncorrelated
behaviour in the spatial direction of the corresponding coupled map lattice for
$N=3$.

Semiconductor artificial graphene nanostructures where Hubbard model
parameter $U/t$ can be of the order of 100, provide a highly controllable
platform to study strongly correlated quantum many-particle phases. We use
accurate variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods to demonstrate a
transition from antiferromagnetic to metallic phases for experimentally
accessible lattice constant $a=50$ nm in terms of lattice site radius $\rho$,
for finite sized artificial honeycomb structures. By analysing spin-spin
correlation functions, we show that edge type, geometry and charge
nonuniformity affect the steepness and the crossover $\rho$ value of the phase
transition. For triangular structures, the metal-insulator transition is
accompanied with a smoother edge polarization transition.

heteroatom co-doping (i.e. with boron and/or nitrogen) is an appealing strategy
to tune both its structural and electronic properties, possibly inducing a band
gap in graphene. However, presently synthesized BN-doped carbon-based materials
are randomly doped, leading to their electronic properties not being
reproducible. Using first-principles techniques, the present study investigates
the periodic doping of graphene with borazine-like rings in order to search for
an entirely new class of BCN hybrid 2D materials exhibiting high stabilities
and optimized band gaps for opto-electronic applications. Ab initio
calculations show that BN-ring doped graphene displays cohesive energies
comparable with benchmark ideal periodic BCN systems (such as BC$_3$,
C$_3$N$_4$, BC$_2$N) with a decreasing linear trend toward high concentrations
of BN-rings. Band gaps of BN-ring doped graphene systems are calculated using
many-body perturbation techniques and are found to be sensitive to the doping
pattern and to be considerably larger for high concentrations of BN rings
exhibiting the same orientation. These predictions suggest that BN-ring doped
graphene materials could be interesting candidates for the next generation of
optoelectronic devices and open new opportunities for their synthesis using
chemical bottom-up approaches.

The calculation of free energies from first principles in materials is a
formidable task which enables the prediction of phase stability with high
accuracy; these calculations are complicated in magnetic materials by the
interplay of electronic, magnetic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. In this
work, we show the feasibility and accuracy of the calculation of phase
stability in magnetic systems with ab initio methods and thermodynamic
integration by sampling the magnetic and vibrational phase space with coupled
atomistic spin dynamics-ab initio molecular dynamics (ASD-AIMD) simulations
[Stockem et al., PRL 121, 125902 (2018)], where energies and interatomic forces
are calculated with density functional theory (DFT). We employ the method to
calculate the phase stability of Fe at ambient pressure from 800 K up to 1800
K. The Gibbs free energy difference between fcc and bcc Fe at zero pressure as
a function of temperature is calculated carrying out thermodynamic integration
over temperature on the energies at the DFT level from ASD-AIMD, using a
reference free energy difference calculated in the paramagnetic state at
temperatures much higher than the magnetic transition temperatures with
thermodynamic integration over stress-strain variables with disordered local
moment (DLM)-AIMD simulations. We show the importance of the magnetic ordering
temperature of bcc Fe on the $\alpha$ to $\gamma$ structural transition
temperature, whereas the $\gamma$ to $\delta$ transition is well reproduced
independently of the exchange interactions. The Gibbs free energy difference
between the two structures is within 5 meV/atom from the CALPHAD estimate, and
both transition temperatures are reproduced within 150 K. The present work
paves the way to free energy calculations in magnetic materials from first
principles with accuracy in the order of 1 meV/atom.

The vision of building computational hardware for problem optimization has
spurred large efforts in the physics community. In particular, networks of Kerr
Parametric Oscillators (KPOs) are envisioned as simulators for finding the
ground states of Ising Hamiltonians. It was shown, however, that KPO networks
can feature large numbers of unexpected solutions that are difficult to sample
with the existing deterministic (i.e., adiabatic) protocols. In this work, we
experimentally realize a system of two coupled KPOs and find good agreement
with the predicted mapping to Ising states. We then introduce a protocol based
on stochastic sampling of the system and show how the resulting probability
distribution can be used to identify the ground state of the corresponding
Ising Hamiltonian. This method is akin to a Monte-Carlo sampling of multiple
out-of-equilibrium stationary states and is less prone to become trapped in
local minima than deterministic protocols. %Our work thus provides a stepping
stone between theory predictions of Hamiltonian mechanics on the one hand, and
the notion of thermodynamics in out-of-equilibrium nonlinear systems on the
other hand.

Multilayers based on quantum materials (complex oxides, topological
insulators, transition-metal dichalcogenides, etc) have enabled the design of
devices that could revolutionize microelectronics and optoelectronics. However,
heterostructures incorporating quantum materials from different families remain
scarce, while they would immensely broaden the range of possible applications.
Here we demonstrate the large-scale integration of compounds from two
highly-multifunctional families: perovskite oxides and transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs). We couple BiFeO$_3$, a room-temperature multiferroic
oxide, and WSe$_2$, a semiconducting two-dimensional material with potential
for photovoltaics and photonics. WSe$_2$ is grown by molecular beam epitaxy and
transferred on a centimeter-scale onto BiFeO$_3$ films. Using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we visualize the electronic structure of 1 to 3
monolayers of WSe$_2$ and evidence a giant energy shift as large as 0.75 eV
induced by the ferroelectric polarization direction in the underlying
BiFeO$_3$. Such a strong shift opens new perspectives in the efficient
manipulation of TMDs properties by proximity effects.

<h3>Thermoelectric properties in semimetals with inelastic electron-hole  scattering</h3>

We present systematic theoretical results on thermoelectric effects in
semimetals based on the variational method of the linearized Boltzmann
equation. Inelastic electron-hole scattering is known to play an important role
in the unusual transport of semimetals, including the broad $T^2$ temperature
dependence of the electrical resistivity and the strong violation of the
Wiedemann-Franz law. By treating the inelastic electron-hole scattering more
precisely beyond the relaxation time approximation, we show that the Seebeck
coefficient when compensated depends on the screening length of the Coulomb
interaction as well as the Lorenz ratio (the ratio of thermal to electric
conductivity due to electrons divided by temperature). It is found that
deviations from the compensation condition significantly increase the Seebeck
coefficient, along with crucial suppressions of the Lorentz ratio. The result
indicates that uncompensated semimetals with the electron-hole scattering have
high thermoelectric efficiency when the phonon contribution to thermal
conductivity is suppressed.

<h3>Analysis of the structural characteristics and optoelectronic properties  of CaTiO3 as a non-toxic raw material for solar cells: A DFT study</h3>

Structural and optoelectronic properties of {\alpha}, \{beta}, {\gamma}
phases of calcium titanate are studied with the implementation of
first-principles quantum-chemical calculations in the framework of DFT. When
optimizing the geometry, the GGA approximation was used. The relaxed lattice
parameters obtained by us are identical with the experimental analogs. It has
been established that the most stable phase of calcium titanate is the
orthorhombic syngony, which corresponds to the results of experimental
measurements. It is shown that as the transition from the {\alpha}-phase to the
{\gamma}-phase proceeds, the lattice constant parameters and the interatomic
distance in these systems increase. The optoelectronic properties of these
materials have been studied using the Wien2k code. The high-precision TB-mBJ
approximation was used to calculate the exchange-correlation effects. An
analysis of the electronic properties of these materials showed that all the
studied phases of calcium titanate belong to the class of wide-gap
semiconductors. The calculated band gaps for the cubic, tetragonal, and
orthorhombic CaTiO3 systems are 2.83, 3.07, and 3.26 eV, respectively.
According to the analysis of DOS-plots, it was found that the tetragonal phase
of calcium titanate is characterized by the highest density of states.
Calculations of the optical constants of the systems under study showed that
the CaTiO3 cubic system is characterized by an increased absorption capacity
and a relatively high photoconductivity. However, for the other two phases of
calcium titanate, the calculations gave identical patterns, i.e., the
absorption and optical conductivity spectra of the tetragonal and orthorhombic
CaTiO3 systems practically coincide.

<h3>Quantum simulator of link models using spinor dipolar ultracold atoms</h3>

We propose a scheme for the quantum simulation of quantum link models in
two-dimensional lattices. Our approach considers spinor dipolar gases on a
suitably shaped lattice, where the dynamics of particles in the different
hyperfine levels of the gas takes place in one-dimensional chains coupled by
the dipolar interactions. We show that at least four levels are needed. The
present scheme does not require any particular fine-tuning of the parameters.
We present a derivation of the parameters of the quantum link models by using a
perturbative method. A comparison with other schemes for $(2+1)$-dimensional
quantum link models present in literature is discussed. Finally, the extension
to three-dimensional lattices is presented, and its subtleties are pointed out.

<h3>Dimensional reduction and incommensurate dynamic correlations in the  $S=\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ca$_3$ReO$_5$Cl$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
The observation of spinon excitations in the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ triangular
antiferromagnet Ca$_3$ReO$_5$Cl$_2$ reveals a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) nature
of magnetic correlations, in spite of the nominally 2D magnetic structure. This
phenomenon is known as frustration-induced dimensional reduction. Here, we
present high-field electron spin resonance spectroscopy and magnetization
studies of Ca$_3$ReO$_5$Cl$_2$, allowing us not only to refine spin-Hamiltonian
parameters, but also to investigate peculiarities of its low-energy spin
dynamics. We argue that the presence of the uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) shifts the spinon continuum in momentum space and, as a
result, opens a zero-field gap at the $\Gamma$ point. We observed this gap
directly. The shift is found to be consistent with the structural modulation in
the ordered state, suggesting this material as a perfect model
triangular-lattice system, where a pure DMI-spiral ground state can be
realized.

<h3>Nonreciprocal collective magnetostatic wave modes in geometrically  asymmetric bilayer structure with nonmagnetic spacer</h3>

Nonreciprocity, i.e. inequivalence in amplitudes and frequencies of spin
waves propagating in opposite directions, is a key property underlying
functionality in prospective magnonic devices. Here we demonstrate
experimentally and theoretically a simple approach to induce frequency
nonreciprocity in a magnetostatically coupled ferromagnetic bilayer structure
with a nonmagnetic spacer by its geometrical asymmetry. Using Brillouin light
scattering, we show the formation of two collective spin wave modes in
Fe$_{81}$Ga$_{19}$/Cu/Fe$_{81}$Ga$_{19}$ structure with different thicknesses
of ferromagnetic layers. Experimental reconstruction and theoretical modeling
of the dispersions of acoustic and optical collective spin wave modes reveal
that both possess nonreciprocity reaching several percent at the wavenumber of
$22~\cdot~10^4$ rad/cm. Analysis demonstrates that the shift of the amplitudes
of counter-propagating coupled modes towards either of the layers is
responsible for the nonreciprocity because of the pronounced dependence of spin
wave frequency on the layers thickness. The proposed approach enables the
design of multilayered ferromagnetic structures with a given spin wave
dispersion for magnonic logic gates.

Geometrically frustrated many-particle quantum systems are notoriously hard
to study numerically but are of profound interest because of their unusual
properties and emergent phenomena. In these systems energetic constraints
cannot be minimized simultaneously, leading to large ground-state degeneracy
and a variety of exotic quantum phases. Here, we present a platform that
enables unprecedentedly detailed experimental exploration of geometrically
frustrated electronic systems on lattices with triangular geometry. We
demonstrate the first realization of triangular atomic Hubbard systems,
directly image Mott insulators in the triangular geometry with single-atom and
single-site resolution, and measure antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlations
for all nearest neighbors allowing for thermometry. This platform provides a
powerful new approach for studying exotic quantum magnetism and direct
detection of quantum spin liquid signatures in Hubbard systems.

We explore the dynamics of a commensurate-incommensurate (C-IC) transition in
a onedimensional model described by the Frenkel-Kontorova model. An
incommensurate ratio of the period of the trapping potential and the average
inter-particle distance triggers a rearrangement of the atoms in a
configuration where they can stably occupy positions dislocated from the
potential minima. We show that the transition mirrors in non-equilibrium
dynamics by unveiling a phenomenon of discrete injection of atomic
dislocations, entering in a 'step-wise' fashion from the edges of the chain.
Furthermore, we show that by quenching the system at the boundary of the C-IC
transition, these discommensurations can be nucleated by thermal or quantum
fluctuations, resulting in a dynamical regime with non-integer number of
dislocations. Our work offers perspectives for exploring dynamical responses
with topological character in trapped ions experiments.
