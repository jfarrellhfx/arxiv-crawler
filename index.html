<h3>Disconnected and multiply connected spectra in the 2D attractive Hubbard  model</h3>

Fermi gases and liquids display an excitation spectrum that is simply
connected, ensuring closed Fermi surfaces. In strongly correlated systems like
the cuprate superconductors, the existence of open sheets of Fermi surface
known as Fermi arcs indicates a distinctly different topology of the spectrum
with no equivalent in Fermi liquid theory. Here, we demonstrate a generic
mechanism by which correlation effects in fermionic systems can change the
topology of the spectrum. Using diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations, we
demonstrate the existence of disconnected and multiply connected excitation
spectra in the attractive Hubbard model in the BCS-BEC cross-over regime. These
topologically nontrivial spectra are a prerequisite for Fermi arcs.

<h3>Intrinsic interface adsorption drives selectivity in atomically smooth  nanofluidic channels</h3>

Specific molecular interactions underlie unexpected and useful phenomena in
nanofluidic systems, but require descriptions that go beyond traditional
macroscopic hydrodynamics. In this letter, we demonstrate how equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations and linear response theory can be synthesized
with hydrodynamics to provide a comprehensive characterization of nanofluidic
transport. Specifically, we study the pressure driven flows of ionic solutions
in nanochannels comprised of two-dimensional crystalline substrates made from
graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. While simple hydrodynamic descriptions do
not predict a streaming electrical current or salt selectivity in such simple
systems, we observe that both arise due to the intrinsic molecular interactions
that act to selectively adsorb ions to the interface in the absence of a net
surface charge. Notably, this emergent selectivity indicates that these
nanochannels can serve as desalination membranes.

Generally adopted design strategies for enhancing the photocatalytic activity
are aimed at tuning properties such as the visible light response, the exposed
crystal facets, and the nanocrystal shape. Here, we present a different
approach for designing efficient photocatalysts displaying a substrate-specific
reactivity upon defect engineering. The defective anisotropic brookite TiO2
photocatalyst functionalized with Pt nanocrystals are tested for alcohol
photoreforming showing up to an 11-fold increase in methanol oxidation rate,
compared to the unreduced one, whilst presenting much lower ethanol or
isopropanol specific oxidation rates. We demonstrate that the alcohol oxidation
and hydrogen evolution reactions are tightly related, and when the
substrate-specific alcohol oxidation ability is increased, the hydrogen
evolution is significantly boosted. The reduced anisotropic brookite shows up
to twenty-six-fold higher specific photoactivity with respect to anatase and
brookite with isotropic nanocrystals, reflecting the different type of
defective catalytic sites formed depending on the TiO2 polymorph and its
crystal shape. Advanced in-situ characterizations and theoretical
investigations reveal that controlled engineering over oxygen vacancies and
lattice strain produces large electron polarons hosting the substrate-specific
active sites for alcohol photo-oxidation.

<h3>Tunable Three-Dimensional Architecture of Nematic Disclination Lines</h3>

Disclinations lines play a key role in many physical processes, from the
fracture of materials to the formation of the early universe. Achieving
versatile control over disclinations is key to developing novel electro-optical
devices, programmable origami, directed colloidal assembly, and controlling
active matter. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to tailor
three-dimensional disclination architecture in nematic liquid crystals
experimentally. We produce quantitative predictions for the connectivity and
shape of disclination lines found in nematics confined between two thinly
spaced glass substrates with strong planar anchoring. By drawing an analogy
between nematic liquid crystals and magnetostatics, we find that: i)
disclination lines connect defects with the same topological charge on opposite
surfaces, and ii) disclination lines are attracted to regions of the highest
twist. Using polarized light to pattern the in-plane alignment of liquid
crystal molecules, we test these predictions experimentally and identify
critical parameters that tune the disclination lines' curvature. We verify our
predictions with computer simulations and find non-dimensional parameters
enabling us to match experiments and simulations at different length scales.
Our work provides a powerful method to understand and practically control
defect lines in nematic liquid crystals.

<h3>An accordion superlattice for controlling atom separation in optical  potentials</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04144" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04144</a>
<br>
<i>Simon Wili, Tilman Esslinger, Konrad Viebahn</i>
<br>
<br>
We propose a method for separating trapped atoms in optical lattices by large
distances. The key idea is the cyclic transfer of atoms between two lattices of
variable spacing, known as accordion lattices, each covering at least a factor
of two in lattice spacing. By coherently loading atoms between the two
superimposed potentials, we can reach, in principle, arbitrarily large atom
separations, while requiring only a relatively small numerical aperture.
Numerical simulations of our `accordion superlattice' show that the atoms
remain localised to one lattice site throughout the separation process, even
for moderate lattice depths. In a proof-of-principle experiment we demonstrate
the optical fields required for the accordion superlattice using acousto-optic
deflectors. The method can be applied to neutral-atom quantum computing with
optical tweezers, as well as quantum simulation of low-entropy many-body
states. For instance, a unit-filling atomic Mott insulator can be coherently
expanded by a factor of ten in order to load an optical tweezer array with very
high filling. In turn, sorted tweezer arrays can be compressed to form
high-density states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The method can be
also be applied to biological systems where dynamical separation of particles
is required.

<h3>Signatures of Supersymmetry in the $ν{=}5/2$ Fractional Quantum Hall  Effect</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04169" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04169</a>
<br>
<i>Songyang Pu, Ajit C. Balram, Mikael Fremling, Andrey Gromov, Zlatko Papić</i>
<br>
<br>
The Moore-Read state, a leading candidate for describing the fractional
quantum Hall effect at filling factor $\nu{=}5/2$, is a paradigmatic $p$-wave
superconductor with non-Abelian topological order. Among its many exotic
properties, the state hosts two collective modes: a bosonic density wave and a
neutral fermion mode that arises from an unpaired electron in the condensate.
It has recently been proposed that the descriptions of the two modes can be
unified by postulating supersymmetry (SUSY) that relates them in the
long-wavelength limit. Here we extend the SUSY description to construct wave
functions of the two modes on closed surfaces, such as the sphere and torus,
and we test the resulting states in large-scale numerical simulations. We
demonstrate the equivalence in the long-wavelength limit between SUSY wave
functions and previous descriptions of collective modes based on the
Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman ansatz, Jack polynomials, and bipartite composite
fermions. Leveraging the first-quantized form of the SUSY wave functions, we
study their energies using the Monte Carlo method and show that realistic
$\nu{=}5/2$ systems are close to the putative SUSY point, where the two
collective modes become degenerate in energy.

<h3>Magic-Angle Twisted Symmetric Trilayer Graphene as Topological Heavy  Fermion Problem</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04171" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04171</a>
<br>
<i>Jiabin Yu, Ming Xie, B. Andrei Bernevig, Sankar Das Sarma</i>
<br>
<br>
Recently, Ref. [1] reformulated magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)
as a topological heavy fermion problem, and used this reformulation to provide
a deeper understanding for the correlated phases at integer fillings. In this
work, we generalize this heavy-fermion paradigm to magic-angle twisted
symmetric trilayer graphene (MATSTG), and propose a low-energy $f-c-d$ model
that reformulates MATSTG as heavy localized $f$ modes coupled to itinerant
topological semimetalic $c$ modes and itinerant Dirac $d$ modes. Our $f-c-d$
model well reproduces the single-particle band structure of MATSTG at low
energies for displacement field $\mathcal{E}\in[0,300]$meV. By performing
Hartree-Fock calculations with the $f-c-d$ model for $\nu=0,-1,-2$ electrons
per Moir\'e unit cell, we reproduce all the correlated ground states obtain
from the previous numerical Hartree-Fock calculations with the
Bistritzer-MacDonald-type (BM-type) model, and we find additional new
correlated ground states at high displacement field. Based on the numerical
results, we propose a simple rule for the ground states at high displacement
fields by using the $f-c-d$ model, and provide analytical derivation for the
rule at charge neutrality. We also provide analytical symmetry arguments for
the (nearly-)degenerate energies of the high-$\mathcal{E}$ ground states at all
the integer fillings of interest, and make experimental predictions of which
charge-neutral states are stabilized in magnetic fields. Our $f-c-d$ model
provides a new perspective for understanding the correlated phenomena in
MATSTG, suggesting that the heavy fermion paradigm of Ref. [1] should be the
generic underpinning of correlated physics in multilayer moire graphene
structures.

<h3>The magnetic field driven superconductor-metal transition in disordered  hole-overdoped cuprates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04175" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04175</a>
<br>
<i>Lina G. Johnsen</i>
<br>
<br>
By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a $d$-wave superconductor,
we explore how the interplay between disorder and the orbital depairing of an
external magnetic field influences the superconductor-metal transition of the
hole-overdoped cuprates. For highly disordered systems, we find granular Cooper
paring to persist above the critical field where the superfluid stiffness goes
to zero. We also show that because the vortices are attracted to regions where
the superconducting pairing is already weak, the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon
zero-bias peak in the local density of states at the vortex cores disappears
already at moderate disorder.

<h3>Amorphous topological matter: theory and experiment</h3>

Topological phases of matter are ubiquitous in crystals, but less is known
about their existence in amorphous systems, that lack long-range order. In this
perspective, we review the recent progress made on theoretically defining
amorphous topological phases and the new phenomenology that they can open. We
revisit key experiments suggesting that amorphous topological phases exist in
both solid-state and synthetic amorphous systems. We finish by discussing the
open questions in the field, that promises to significantly enlarge the set of
materials and synthetic systems benefiting from the robustness of topological
matter.

<h3>Electronic character of charge order in square planar low valence  nickelates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04184" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04184</a>

<br>
<br>
Charge order is a central feature of the physics of cuprate superconductors
and is known to arise from a modulation of holes with primarily oxygen
character. Low-valence nickelate superconductors also host charge order, but
the electronic character of this symmetry breaking is unsettled. Here, using
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Ni $L_2$-edge, we identify
intertwined involvements of Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$, $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$, and O
$2p_{\sigma}$ orbitals in the formation of diagonal charge order in an
overdoped low-valence nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{8}$. The Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$
orbitals, strongly hybridized with planar O $2p_{\sigma}$, largely shape the
spatial charge distribution and lead to Ni site-centered charge order. The
$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals play a small, but non-negligible role in the charge
order as they hybridize with the rare-earth $5d$ orbitals. Our results reveal
that the low-energy physics and ground-state character of these nickelates are
more complex than those in cuprates.

<h3>Pseudopotential Bethe-Salpeter calculations for shallow-core x-ray  absorption near-edge structures: excitonic effects in Al2O3</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04199" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04199</a>
<br>
<i>M. Laura Urquiza, Matteo Gatti, Francesco Sottile</i>
<br>
<br>
We present an ab initio description of optical and X-ray absorption
spectroscopies, in a unified formalism based on the pseudopotential plane-wave
method at the level of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) within Green's
functions theory. We show that norm-conserving pseudopotentials are very
reliable and accurate not only for valence, but also for semi-core electron
absorption spectra. In order to validate our approach, we compare BSE results
with two codes: EXC, based on pseudopotentials, and Exciting, an all-electron
full-potential code. We take corundum Al2O3 as an example, a prototypical
system that presents strong electron-hole interaction in both valence and core
electron excitations. We analyze the optical, as well as the L$_1$ and
L$_{2,3}$ edges, in detail in terms of anisotropy, crystal local fields,
interference and excitonic effects. We conclude with a thorough inspection of
the origin and localization of bright and dark excitons.

<h3>Next nearest neighbour coupling with spinor polariton condensates</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04210" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04210</a>
<br>
<i>Dmitriy Dovzhenko, Denis Aristov, Lucy Pickup, Helgi Sigurdsson, Pavlos G. Lagoudakis</i>
<br>
<br>
We report on experimental observation of next-nearest-neighbour coupling
between ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton condensates in a
planar semiconductor microcavity. All-optical control over the coupling
strength between neighbouring condensates is demonstrated through
distance-periodic pseudospin screening of their ballistic particle outflow due
to the inherent splitting of the planar cavity transverse-electric (TE) and
transverse-magnetic (TM) modes. By screening the nearest-neighbour coupling we
overcome the conventional spatial coupling hierarchy between condensates. This
offers a promising route towards creating unconventional non-planar many-body
Hamiltonians using networks of ballistically expanding spinor exciton-polariton
condensates.

<h3>Correlative mapping of local hysteresis properties in VO$_2$</h3>

<br>
<br>
We have developed a new optical microscopy technique able to track
micron-sized surface clusters as temperature is varied. Potential candidates
for study include phase separated metal-insulator materials, ferroelectrics,
and porous structures. Several key techniques (including autofocus, step
motor/cross correlation alignments, single-pixel thresholding, pair
connectivity correlation length and image convolution) were implemented in
order to obtain a time series of thresholded images. Here, we apply this new
method to probe the archetypal phase separated insulator-metal transition in
VO$_2$. A precise time and temperature series of the insulator-metal transition
was achieved, allowing us to construct for the first time in this material
spatial maps of the transition temperature T$_c$. These maps reveal multiple
interesting features such as fractal electronic patterns on micron scales,
regions of the sample with an extremely large or nearly absent local
hysteresis, a positive correlation between the T$_c$ value and the hysteresis
width $\Delta$T$_c$, and high cycle-to-cycle reproducibility of the transition.
These maps also allow for the identification of individual pixels with unique
transition characteristics. This unprecedented knowledge of the local
properties of each spot along with the behavior of the entire network paves the
way to novel electronics applications enabled by, {\em e.g.}, addressing
specific regions with desired memory and/or switching characteristics, as well
as detailed explorations of open questions in the theory of hysteresis.

<h3>Red Emission from Copper-Vacancy Color Centers in Zinc Sulfide Colloidal  Nanocrystals</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04223" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04223</a>
<br>
<i>Sarah M. Thompson, Cüneyt Şahin, Shengsong Yang, Michael E. Flatté, Christopher B. Murray, Lee C. Bassett, Cherie R. Kagan</i>
<br>
<br>
Copper-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) exhibits down-conversion luminescence in
the UV, visible, and IR regions of the electromagnetic spectrum; the visible
red, green, and blue emission is referred to as R-Cu, G-Cu, and B-Cu,
respectively. The sub-bandgap emission arises from optical transitions between
localized electronic states created by point defects, making ZnS:Cu a prolific
phosphor material and an intriguing candidate material for quantum information
science, where point defects excel as single-photon sources and spin qubits.
Colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) of ZnS:Cu are particularly interesting as hosts
for the creation, isolation, and measurement of quantum defects, since their
size, composition, and surface chemistry can be precisely tailored for
bio-sensing and opto-electronic applications. Here, we present a method for
synthesizing colloidal ZnS:Cu NCs that emit primarily R-Cu, which has been
proposed to arise from the Cu$_{Zn}$-V$_S$ complex, an impurity-vacancy point
defect structure analogous to well-known quantum defects in other materials
that produce favorable optical and spin dynamics. First principles calculations
confirm the thermodynamic stability and electronic structure of
Cu$_{Zn}$-V$_S$. Temperature- and time-dependent optical properties of ZnS:Cu
NCs show blueshifting luminescence and a non-monotonic intensity dependence as
temperature is increased from 19 K to 290 K, for which we propose an empirical
dynamical model based on thermally-activated coupling between two manifolds of
states inside the ZnS bandgap. Understanding of R-Cu emission dynamics,
combined with a controlled synthesis method for obtaining R-Cu centers in
colloidal NC hosts, will greatly facilitate the development of Cu$_{Zn}$-V$_S$
and related complexes as quantum point defects in ZnS.

<h3>Magnetic anisotropy and low-energy spin dynamics in magnetic van der  Waals compounds Mn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$ and MnNiP$_{2}$S$_{6}$</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04239" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04239</a>
<br>
<i>J. J. Abraham, Y. Senyk, Y. Shemerliuk, S. Selter, S. Aswartham, B. Büchner, V. Kataev, A. Alfonsov</i>
<br>
<br>
We report the detailed high-field and high-frequency electron spin resonance
(HF-ESR) spectroscopic study of the single-crystalline van der Waals compounds
Mn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$ and MnNiP$_{2}$S$_{6}$. Analysis of magnetic excitations
shows that in comparison to Mn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$ increasing the Ni content
yields a larger magnon gap in the ordered state and a larger g-factor value and
its anisotropy in the paramagnetic state. The studied compounds are found to be
strongly anisotropic having each the unique ground state and type of magnetic
order. Stronger deviation of the g-factor from the free electron value in the
samples containing Ni suggests that the anisotropy of the exchange is an
important contributor to the stabilization of a certain type of magnetic order
with particular anisotropy. At the temperatures above the magnetic order, we
have analyzed the spin-spin correlations resulting in a development of slowly
fluctuating short-range order. They are much stronger pronounced in
MnNiP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ compared to Mn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$. The enhanced spin
fluctuations in MnNiP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ are attributed to the competition of
different types of magnetic order. Finally, the analysis of the temperature
dependent critical behavior of the magnon gaps below the ordering temperature
in Mn$_{2}$P$_{2}$S$_{6}$ suggest that the character of the spin wave
excitations in this compound undergoes a field induced crossover from a 3D-like
towards 2D XY regime.

<h3>Anionic nickel and nitrogen effects in the chiral antiferromagnetic  antiperovskite Mn$_3$NiN</h3>
<a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04242" target = "_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04242</a>
<br>
<i>E. Triana-Ramírez, W. Ibarra-Hernandez, A. C. Garcia-Castro</i>
<br>
<br>
Magnetic antiperovskites, holding chiral noncollinear antiferromagnetic
ordering, have shown remarkable properties that cover from negative thermal
expansion to anomalous Hall effect. Nevertheless, details on the electronic
structure related to the oxidation states and the octahedral center's site
effect are still scarce. Here, we show a theoretical study, based on
first-principles calculations in the framework of the density-functional
theory, DFT, on the electronic details associated with the nitrogen site effect
into the structural, electronic, magnetic, and topological degrees of freedom.
Thus, we show that the nitrogen-vacancy increases the values of the anomalous
Hall conductivity and retains the chiral $\Gamma_{4g}$ antiferromagnetic
ordering. Moreover, we reveal, based on the Bader charges and the electronic
structure analysis, the negative and positive oxidation states in the Ni and Mn
sites, respectively. The latter is in agreement with the expected
$A_3^{\alpha+}B^{\beta-}X^{\delta-}$ oxidation states to satisfy the charge
neutrality in the antiperovskites, but rare for transition metals. Finally, we
extrapolate our findings on the oxidation states to several Mn$_3B$N compounds
showing that the antiperovskite structure is an ideal platform to encounter
negative oxidation states in metals sitting at the corner $B$-site.

<h3>Performance Analysis of Superconductor-constriction-Superconductor  Transmon Qubits</h3>

<br>
<br>
This work presents a computational analysis of a superconducting transmon
qubit design, in which the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS)
Josephson junction is replaced by a co-planar,
superconductor-constriction-superconductor (ScS) junction. For short junctions
having a Kulik-Omelyanchuk current-phase relationship, we find that the ScS
transmon has an improved charge dispersion compared to the SIS transmon, with a
tradeoff of 50% smaller anharmonicity. These calculations provide a framework
for estimating the superconductor material properties and junction dimensions
needed to provide proper ScS transmon operation at typical gigahertz
frequencies.

<h3>Simulations of Disordered Matter in 3D with the Morphological  Autoregressive Protocol (MAP): Water</h3>

Disordered molecular systems such as amorphous catalysts, organic thin films,
electrolyte solutions, even water are at the cutting edge of computational
exploration today. Traditional simulations of such systems at length-scales
relevant to experiments in practice require a compromise between model accuracy
and quality of sampling. To remedy the situation, we have developed an approach
based on generative machine learning called the Morphological Autoregressive
Protocol (MAP). The MAP provides computational access to mesoscale disordered
molecular configurations at linear cost at generation for materials in which
structural correlations decay sufficiently rapidly. The algorithm is
implemented using an augmented PixelCNN deep learning architecture that we
previously demonstrated produces excellent results in 2 dimensions for
mono-elemental molecular systems. Here we extend our implementation to
multi-elemental 3D and demonstrate performance using water as our test system
in two scenarios: 1. liquid water, and 2. a sample with a small ice nucleus. We
trained the model on small-scale samples of liquid water produced using
path-integral molecular dynamics simulation including nuclear quantum effects
under ambient conditions. MAP-generated water configurations are shown to
accurately reproduce the properties of the training set and to produce stable
and physically sound behaviors when used to initialize classical and quantum
dynamical simulations. We expect our approach to perform equally well on other
disordered molecular systems given a suitable training set.

The Su, Schrieffer and Heeger (SSH) model, describing the soliton excitations
in polyacetylene due to the formation of antiphase domain walls (DW) from the
alternating bond pattern, has served as a paradigmatic example of
one-dimensional (1D) chiral topological insulators. While the SSH model has
been realized in photonic and plasmonic systems, there have been limited
analogues in three-dimensional (3D) electronic systems, especially regarding
the formation of antiphase DWs. Here, we propose that pristine bulk Bi, in
which the dimerization of $(111)$ atomic layers renders alternating covalent
and van der Waals bonding within and between successive $(111)$ bilayers,
respectively, serves as a 3D analogue of the SSH model. First, we confirm that
the two dimerized Bi structures belong to different Zak phases of 0 and $\pi$
by considering the parity eigenvalues and Wannier charge centers, while the
previously reported bulk topological phases of Bi remain invariant under the
dimerization reversal. Next, we demonstrate the existence of topologically
non-trivial $(111)$ and trivial $(11\bar{2})$ DWs in which the number of in-gap
DW states (ignoring spin) is odd and even respectively, and show how this
controls the interlinking of the Zak phases of the two adjacent domains.
Finally, we derive general criteria specifying when a DW of arbitrary
orientation exhibits a $\pi$ Zak phase based on the flip of parity eigenvalues.
An experimental realization of dimerization in Bi and the formation of DWs may
be achieved via intense femtosecond laser excitations that can alter the
interatomic forces and bond lengths.

This study investigates radiation damage in three metals in the low
temperature and high radiant flux regime using molecular dynamics and a Frenkel
pair accumulation method to simulate up to $2.0$ displacements per atom. The
metals considered include Fe, equiatomic CrCoNi, and a fictitious metal with
identical bulk properties to the CrCoNi composed of a single atom type referred
to as an A-atom. CrCoNi is found to sustain higher concentrations of
dislocations than either the Fe or A-atom systems and more stacking faults than
the A-atom system. The results suggest that the concentration of vacancies and
interstitials are substantially higher for the CrCoNi than the A-atom system,
perhaps reflecting that the recombination radius is smaller in CrCoNi due to
the roughened potential energy landscape. A model that partitions the major
contributions from defects to the stored energy is described, and serves to
highlight a general need for higher fidelity approaches to point defect
identification.

Creation of stable intrinsically anisotropic self-bound states with embedded
vorticity is a challenging issue. Previously, no such states in Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) or other physical settings were known. Dipolar BEC suggests
a unique possibility to predict stable anisotropic vortex quantum droplets
(AVQDs). We demonstrate that they can be created with the vortex' axis oriented
\emph{perpendicular} to the polarization of dipoles. The stability area and
characteristics of the AVQDs in the parameter space are revealed by means of
analytical and numerical methods. Further, the rotation of the polarizing
magnetic field is considered, and the largest angular velocities, up to which
spinning AVQDs can follow the rotation in clockwise and anti-clockwise
directions, are found. Collisions between moving AVQDs are studied too,
demonstrating formation of bound states with a vortex-antivortex-vortex
structure. A stability domain for such stationary bound states is identified. A
possibility of the creation of AVQDs in a two-component dipolar BEC is briefly
considered too.

The organic system,
$\kappa$-[(BEDT-TTF)$_{1-x}$(BEDT-STF)$_x$]$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$, showing the Mott
transition between a nonmagnetic Mott insulating (NMI) state and a Fermi liquid
(FL), is systematically studied by calorimetric measurements. An increase of
the electronic heat capacity at the transition from the NMI state to the FL
state which keeps the triangular dimer lattice demonstrates that the charge
sector lost in the Mott insulating state is recovered in the FL state. We
observed that the remaining low-energy spin excitations in the Mott insulating
state show unique temperature dependence, and that the NMI state has a larger
lattice entropy originating from the frustrated lattice, which leads to the
Pomeranchuk-like effect on the electron localization. Near the Mott boundary,
an unexpected enhancement and magnetic-field dependence of heat capacity are
observed. This anomalous heat capacity is different from the behavior in the
typical first-order Mott transition and shows similarities with quantum
critical behavior. To reconcile our results with previously reported scenarios
about a spin gap and the first-order Mott transition, further studies are
desired.

Wilson fermion (WF) is a fundamental particle in the theory of quantum
chromodynamics, originally proposed by Kenneth Wilson to solve the fermion
doubling problem, i.e., more fermions than expected when one puts fermionic
fields on a lattice. In this Letter, we report a direct observation of the WF
in circuit systems. It is found that WFs manifest as topological spin textures
analogous to the half skyrmion, half-skyrmion pair, and N\'{e}el skyrmion
structures, depending on their mass. Transformations of different WF states are
realized by merely tuning the electric elements. Interestingly enough, we show
that the WF with a half-skyrmion profile represents a novel quantum anomalous
semimetal phase supporting a chiral edge current. We experimentally observe the
propagation of chiral edge current along the domain-wall separating two
circuits with contrast fractional Chern numbers. Our work presents the first
experimental evidence for WFs in topolectrical circuits. The nontrivial analogy
between the WF state and the skyrmionic structure builds an intimate connection
between the two burgeoning fields.

<br>
<br>
NiPSe3 is regarded as a bandwidth-controlled Mott insulator, distinct from
the widely studied Mott insulating magnetic graphene MPSe3 (M = Mn and Fe)
family. By employing high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we observe
two structural transitions as a function of pressure. With the help of
first-principles calculations, we discover the antiferromagnetic (AFM) moment
directions of NiPSe3 switch from out-of-plane to in-plane and the honeycomb
layers slide relative to each other at the first structural transition. The
in-plane AFM order persists until the second structural transition, whereupon
the two-dimensional (2D) structure assumes a more three-dimensional (3D)
character. A bandwidth-controlled Mott insulator-metal transition (IMT) occurs
between the two structural transitions at 8.0 GPa, concomitant with the
emergence of superconductivity with 4.8 K. The superconductivity in NiPSe3
emerging in the 2D monoclinic phase coexists with the in-plane AFM order and
continues into the 3D trigonal phase. Our electronic structure calculations
reveal that the Mott IMT and superconductivity in NiPSe3 are both closely
related to the enhanced Se2- 4p and Ni2+ 3d electronic hybridizations under
pressure. From these results, we construct the temperature-pressure electronic
phase diagram of NiPSe3, revealing rich physics and many similarities with
copper oxide and iron-based superconductors.

Photocatalytic water splitting represents a very promising but at the same
time very challenging contribution to a clean and renewable route to produce
hydrogen fuel. Developing efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts for water
splitting is a growing need. For this purpose, semiconductor photocatalysts
have attracted much more attention due to their stability and low manufacturing
cost. Here, we have systematically applied several state-of-the-art advanced
first-principles-based methodologies, viz., hybrid density functional theory,
many-body perturbation theory (G$_0$W$_0$) and density functional perturbation
theory (DFPT), to understand the electronic structure properties of ABX$_2$Y
perovskites. We have chosen the vast composition space of ABX$_2$Y type
perovskites where A and B are cations and X and Y can be nitrogen, oxygen, or
fluorine. These perovskites exhibit direct band gaps ranging from 1.6 to 3.3
eV. Further, to evaluate the feasibility of the visible light catalytic
performance, we calculate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of
ABX$_2$Y perovskites. In addition, from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism, BaInO$_2$F, InSnO$_2$N, CsPbO$_2$F
and LaNbN$_2$O are found as probable photocatalysts.

<h3>Dissipation Dynamics Driven Transitions of the Density Matrix Topology</h3>

The dynamical evolution of an open quantum system can be governed by the
Lindblad equation of the density matrix. In this letter, we propose that the
density matrix topology can undergo a transition during the Lindbladian
dynamical evolution. Here we characterize the density matrix topology by the
topological invariant of its modular Hamiltonian. We focus on the fermionic
Gaussian state, where the modular Hamiltonian is a quadratic operator of a set
of fermionic operators. The topological classification of such Hamiltonians
depends on their symmetry classes. Hence, a primary issue we deal with in this
work is to determine the requirement for the Lindbladian operators, under which
the modular Hamiltonian can maintain its symmetry class during the dynamical
evolution. When these conditions are satisfied, along with a nontrivial
topological classification of the symmetry class of the modular Hamiltonian, a
topological transition can occur as time evolves. We present two examples of
dissipation driven topological transitions where the modular Hamiltonian lies
in the AIII class with U(1) symmetry and in the DIII class without U(1)
symmetry, respectively. As a manifestation of the topological transition, we
present the signature of the eigenvalues of the density matrix at the
transition point.

Zeolites have been used in industrial applications such as catalysts, ion
exchangers, and molecular sieves because of their unique porous atomic
structures. However, the direct observation of zeolitic local atomic structures
via electron microscopy is difficult owing to their low resistance to electron
irradiation. Subsequently, the fundamental relationships between these
structures and their properties remain unclear. A novel low-electron-dose
imaging technique, optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (OBF STEM) has recently been developed. It reconstructs images with
a high signal-to-noise ratio and a dose efficiency approximately two orders of
magnitude higher than that of conventional methods. Herein, we performed
low-dose atomic-resolution OBF STEM observations of an FAU-type zeolite,
effectively visualizing all the atomic sites in its framework. Additionally,
the complex local atomic structure of the twin boundaries in the zeolite was
directly characterized. The results of this study facilitate the
characterization of the local atomic structures in many electron-beam-sensitive
materials.

The quantitative characterisation of crack tip loads is fundamental in
fracture mechanics. Although the potential influence of higher order terms on
crack growth and stability is known, classical studies solely rely on first
order stress intensity factors. We calculate higher order Williams coefficients
using an integral technique based on conjugate work integrals and study the
convergence with increasing crack tip distance. We compare the integral method
to the state-of-the-art fitting method and provide results for higher-order
terms with several crack lengths, external forces, and sizes for widely used
middle tension, single-edge cracked tension, and compact tension specimen under
mode-I loading.

Quantum phase-slip (QPS) is the exact dual to the well-known Josephson
effect. Although there are numerous proposals for applications of QPS devices,
experimental work to develop these remains in the relatively early stages.
Significant barriers to exploiting QPS nanowires for useful technologies still
exist, such as establishing robust nanowire fabrication methods that allow
coupling to low-loss circuits, and demonstrating control over the QPS process
with an experimenter-controlled external bias. Here we report experiments which
show that both of these barriers have been overcome. We present measurements at
300 mK of NbN coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators embedded with nanowires
fabricated using a neon focused ion-beam. The internal quality factor exceeds
$2\times10^{4}$ -- significantly higher than previously reported in comparable
experiments. The resonator frequency tunes periodically with an applied
magnetic field, revealing tunnelling of the order parameter that always occurs
at half-integer values of the applied flux. In contrast to previous studies of
single QPS, the order-parameter tunnelling is shown to be adiabatic,
demonstrating improved control over energy dissipation in nanowire QPS
circuits. Our results highlight a promising pathway towards realising low-loss
nanowire-based QPS devices.

<br>
<br>
The wealth of complex polar topologies recently found in nanoscale
ferroelectrics result from a delicate balance between the materials intrinsic
tendency to develop a homogeneous polarization and the electric and mechanic
boundary conditions imposed upon them. Ferroelectric dielectric interfaces are
model systems where polarization curling originates from open circuit like
electric boundary conditions, to avoid the build-up of polarization charges
through the formation of flux closure domains that evolve into vortex like
structures at the nanoscale. Interestingly, while ferroelectricity is known to
couple strongly to strain (both homogeneous and inhomogeneous), the effect of
mechanical constraints on thin film nanoscale ferroelectrics has been
comparatively less explored because of the relative paucity of strain patterns
that can be implemented experimentally. Here we show that the stacking of
freestanding ferroelectric perovskite layers with controlled twist angles opens
an unprecedented opportunity to tailor these topological nanostructures in a
way determined by the lateral strain modulation associated to the twisting.
Interestingly, we find that a peculiar pattern of polarization vortices and
antivortices emerges from the flexoelectric coupling of polarization to strain
gradients. This finding opens exciting opportunities to create two-dimensional
high density vortex crystals that would allow us to explore novel physical
effects and functionalities.

<h3>Detecting charge transfer in defective 2D WS2 with electron ptychography</h3>

<br>
<br>
Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental
information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly
image than the atomic structure. Bonding generally involves a relatively small
perturbation of the total charge density dominated by the atomic nuclei, and
thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity
than structural imaging. Here we apply the dose efficiency of electron
ptychography to detect charge transfer in both the pristine structure of
monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} and at its defects, even at modest electron
irradiation doses. Ptychography allows residual aberrations that effect the
phase images to be corrected after collection, leading to excellent agreement
with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse
scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics
based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography
configuration also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the
annular dark-field signal, which allows unambiguous interpretation of the
atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the
charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic
reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to
aid their interpretation.

<br>
Noisy scattering dynamics in the randomly driven H\'enon-Heiles system is
investigated in the range of initial energies where the motion is unbounded. In
this paper we study, with the help of the exit basins and the escape time
distributions, how an external perturbation, be it dissipation or periodic
forcing with a random phase, can enhance or mitigate the unpredictability of a
system that exhibit chaotic scattering. In fact, if basin boundaries have the
Wada property, predictability becomes very complicated, since the basin
boundaries start to intermingle, what means that there are points of different
basins close to each other. The main responsible of this unpredictability is
the external forcing with random phase, while the dissipation can recompose the
basin boundaries and turn the system more predictable. Therefore, we do the
necessary simulations to find out the values of dissipation and external
forcing for which the exit basins present the Wada property. Through these
numerical simulations, we show that the presence of the Wada basins have a
specific relation with the damping, the forcing amplitude and the energy value.
Our approach consists on investigating the dynamics of the system in order to
gain knowledge able to control the unpredictability due to the Wada basins.

Searching for topological insulators in solids is one of the main issues of
modern condensed matter physics since robust gapless edge or surface states of
the topological insulators can be used as building blocks of next-generation
devices. Enhancing spin-orbit couplings is a promising way to realize
topological insulators in solids, whereas the amplitude of the spin-orbit
couplings is not sufficiently large in most materials. Here we show a way to
realize a topological insulator with spin-polarized edges in organic
antiferromagnetic Mott insulators without relying on the spin-orbit coupling.
The obtained topological insulator can have a large charge gap compared to the
conventional topological insulators, since Coulomb interactions mainly govern
the amplitude of the charge gap in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulators.
Besides the mean-field analysis, we demonstrate that the topological phase
survives against electron correlation effects by calculating the many-body
topological invariant. Our finding provides an unprecedented way to realize a
topological insulator in strongly correlated electron systems.

<br>
<br>
In the iron--chromium system, Fe$_{x}$Cr$_{1-x}$, a wide dome of spin-glass
behavior emerges when the ferromagnetism of iron is suppressed and the
antiferromagnetism of chromium emerges as a function of increasing iron content
$x$. As both, the high-temperature state and the characteristic cluster size
vary as a function of $x$, different regimes of spin-glass behavior may be
compared in a single, isostructural material system. Here, we report a study of
the spin dynamics across the freezing process into the spin-glass state for
different iron concentrations ($x = 0.145$, $0.175$, $0.21$) using Modulation
of IntEnsity with Zero Effort (MIEZE) spectroscopy. In the parameter range
studied, the relaxation process observed experimentally may be described well
in terms of a stretched exponential. In the reentrant cluster-glass regime, $x
= 0.145$, this behavior persists up to high temperatures. In comparison, in the
superparamagnetic regime, $x = 0.175$ and $x = 0.21$, a single relaxation time
at elevated temperatures is observed. For all samples studied, the spin
relaxation exhibits a momentum dependence consistent with a power law,
providing evidence of a dispersive character of the spin relaxation.

we determine the optimal laser pump parameters for which long-range
$\eta$-pairing becomes dominant after pulse irradiation. The time-dependent

A well-characterised sample of silicon tunable-barrier electron pump has been
operated at a frequency of 2 GHz using a custom drive waveform, generating a
pump current of 320 pA. Precision measurements of the current were made as a
function of pump control parameters, using a blind protocol, over a 7-week
campaign. The combined standard uncertainty for each 10 hour measurement was
0.1 parts per million. The pump current exhibits a plateau along the exit gate
voltage flat to approximately 0.1 parts per million, but offset from ef by 0.2
parts per million. This offset may be a sign of errors in the current
traceability chain, indicating a limit to the accuracy of small current scaling
using existing methods based on cryogenic current comparators.

Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) down to the
monolayer (ML) limit provide a fertile platform for exploring charge-density
waves (CDWs). Though bulk NbTe2 is known to harbor a single axis 3*1 CDW
coexisting with non-trivial quantum properties, the scenario in the ML limit is
still experimentally unknown. In this study, we unveil the richness of the CDW
phases in ML NbTe2, where not only the theoretically predicted 4*4 and 4*1
phases, but also two unexpected sqrt(28)*sqrt(28) and sqrt(19)*sqrt(19) phases,
can be realized. For such a complex CDW system, we establish an exhaustive
growth phase diagram via systematic efforts in the material synthesis and
scanning tunneling microscope characterization. Moreover, we report that the
energetically stable phase is the larger scale order (sqrt(19)*sqrt(19)), which
is surprisingly in contradiction to the prior prediction (4*4). These findings
are confirmed using two different kinetic pathways, i.e., direct growth at
proper growth temperatures (T), and low-T growth followed by high-T annealing.
Our results provide a comprehensive diagram of the "zoo" of CDW orders in ML
1T-NbTe2 for the first time and offer a new material platform for studying
novel quantum phases in the 2D limit.

Heterogeneous and complex networks represent the intertwined interactions
between real-world elements or agents. A fundamental problem of complex network
theory involves finding inherent partitions, clusters, or communities. By
taking advantage of the recent Laplacian Renormalization Group approach, we
scrutinize information diffusion pathways throughout networks to shed further
light on this issue. Based on inter-node communicability, our definition
provides a unifying framework for multiple partitioning measures. Moreover, we
account for the elusive behavior of components bridging different communities

Calorimetry for equilibrium systems reveals the parameter-dependent
occupation statistics of energy levels by measuring thermal response.
Nonequilibrium versions are expected to add information on their dynamical
accessibility. Calculations on a driven many-body system confirm that
expectation. Modeling electrons hopping between quantum dots, the asymmetric
exclusion process provides a Fermi Golden Rule approximation upon adding births
and deaths at each dot. This yields a fermionic nonequilibrium steady state
where the heat capacity is computed exactly by evaluating the heat fluxes
entirely due to the changing of the ambient temperature. In particular, the
heat capacity depends on the symmetric kinetic barrier for loading and emptying
the quantum dot, invisible at equilibrium. Moreover, we find a zero-temperature
dynamical phase transition, shown by the sudden divergence of the heat capacity
when the Fermi energy and the kinetic barrier become approximately equal. The
nonvanishing heat capacity at absolute zero, violating an extended Third Law,
is caused by the relaxation times exceeding the dissipation time. Finally, when
the kinetic barrier is density-dependent, a low-temperature regime of negative
heat capacity appears, indicating an anti-correlation between the temperature
dependence of the stationary occupation and the excess heat.

Previous studies have shown that the bulk topology of single-particle systems
can be captured by the band inversion surface or by the spin inversion surface
emerged on the time-averaged spin polarization. Most of the studies, however,
are based on the single-particle picture even though the systems are fermionic
and of multi-bands. Here, we study the many-body quench dynamics of topological
systems with all the valence bands fully occupied, and show that the concepts
of band inversion surface and spin inversion surface are still valid. More
importantly, the many-body quench dynamics is shown to be reduced to a
nontrivial three-level Landau-Zener model, which can be solved exactly. Based
on the analytical results, the topological spin texture revealed by the
time-averaged spin polarization can be applied to characterize the bulk
topology and thus provides a direct comparison for future experiments.

<h3>Towards a unified nonlocal, peridynamics framework for the  coarse-graining of molecular dynamics data with fractures</h3>

Molecular dynamics (MD) has served as a powerful tool for designing materials
with reduced reliance on laboratory testing. However, the use of MD directly to
treat the deformation and failure of materials at the mesoscale is still
largely beyond reach. Herein, we propose a learning framework to extract a
peridynamic model as a mesoscale continuum surrogate from MD simulated material
fracture datasets. Firstly, we develop a novel coarse-graining method, to
automatically handle the material fracture and its corresponding
discontinuities in MD displacement dataset. Inspired by the Weighted
Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme, the key idea lies at an adaptive procedure
to automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, then reconstruct the
coarse-grained material displacement field as piecewise smooth solutions
containing discontinuities. Then, based on the coarse-grained MD data, a
two-phase optimization-based learning approach is proposed to infer the optimal
peridynamics model with damage criterion. In the first phase, we identify the
optimal nonlocal kernel function from datasets without material damage, to
capture the material stiffness properties. Then, in the second phase, the
material damage criterion is learnt as a smoothed step function from the data
with fractures. As a result, a peridynamics surrogate is obtained. Our
peridynamics surrogate model can be employed in further prediction tasks with
different grid resolutions from training, and hence allows for substantial
reductions in computational cost compared with MD. We illustrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer
graphene. Our tests show that the proposed data-driven model is robust and
generalizable: it is capable in modeling the initialization and growth of
fractures under discretization and loading settings that are different from the
ones used during training.

The Berry curvature (BC) - a quantity encoding the geometric properties of
the electronic wavefunctions in a solid - is at the heart of different
Hall-like transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall and the non-linear
Hall and Nernst effects. In non-magnetic quantum materials with acentric
crystalline arrangements, local concentrations of BC are generally linked to
single-particle wavefunctions that are a quantum superposition of electron and
hole excitations. BC-mediated effects are consequently observed in
two-dimensional systems with pairs of massive Dirac cones and three-dimensional
bulk crystals with quartets of Weyl cones. Here, we demonstrate that in
materials equipped with orbital degrees of freedom local BC concentrations can
arise even in the complete absence of hole excitations. In these solids, the
crystals fields appearing in very low-symmetric structures trigger BCs
characterized by hot-spots and singular pinch points. These characteristics
naturally yield giant BC dipoles and large non-linear transport responses in
time-reversal symmetric conditions.

We consider a perturbed version of a very simple and exactly solvable model
that supports Fermi arcs and pseudogap in its ground state and excitation
spectrum, which includes Hubbard-like interactions in both momentum and real
spaces. We find the combined effects give rise to non-Fermi liquid behavior in
the electron self-energy. Comparison will be made with phenomenology of high
temperature cuprate superconductors.

The phenomenology of the iron pnictide superconductor can be described by the
threeband s+- Eliashberg theory in which the mechanism of superconducting
coupling is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and whose
characteristic energy W0 scales with Tc according to the empirical law W0 =
4.65kBTc. This model presents the universal characteristics that are
independent of the critical temperature, such as the link between the two free
parameters l13 and l23 and the ratio Di/kBTc.

Two-dimensional semimetals with tilted Dirac cones in the electronic band
structure are shown to exhibit spatial separation of carriers belonging to
different valleys under illumination. In stark contrast to gapped Dirac
materials this optovalleytronic phenomenon occurs in systems with intact
inversion and time-reversal symmetry that host massless Dirac cones in the band
structure, thereby retaining the exceptional graphene-like transport
properties. As a result we demonstrate that optical valley separation is
possible at arbitrarily low photon frequencies including the deep infrared and
terahertz regimes with full gate tunability via Pauli blocking. As a specific
example of our theory, we demonstrate tunable valley separation in the proposed
two-dimensional tilted Dirac cone semimetal 8-$Pmmn$ borophene for incident
infrared photons at room temperature.

We study mesoscopic signatures of the topological Anderson transitions in 1D
chains. To this end we introduce an integer-valued sample-specific definition
of the topological index in finite size systems. Its phase diagram exhibits a
fascinating structure of intermittent topological phases, dubbed topological
islands. Their statistics exhibits finite-size scaling, pointing to the
location of the bulk topological Anderson transition. While the average theory
in AIII and BDI symmetry classes is rather similar, the corresponding patterns
of topological islands and their statistics are qualitatively different. We
also discuss observable signatures of sharp topological transitions in
mesoscopic systems, such as persistent currents and entanglement spectra.

Over the past decades, superconducting qubits have emerged as one of the
leading hardware platforms for realizing a quantum processor. Consequently,
researchers have made significant effort to understand the loss channels that
limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits. A major source of loss has
been attributed to two level systems that are present at the material
interfaces. We recently showed that replacing the metal in the capacitor of a
transmon with tantalum yields record relaxation and coherence times for
superconducting qubits, motivating a detailed study of the tantalum surface. In
this work, we study the chemical profile of the surface of tantalum films grown
on c-plane sapphire using variable energy X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(VEXPS). We identify the different oxidation states of tantalum that are
present in the native oxide resulting from exposure to air, and we measure
their distribution through the depth of the film. Furthermore, we show how the
volume and depth distribution of these tantalum oxidation states can be altered
by various chemical treatments. By correlating these measurements with detailed
measurements of quantum devices, we can improve our understanding of the
microscopic device losses.

Cerium-based ternary compounds CeNi$_2$Cd$_{20}$ and CePd$_2$Cd$_{20}$ do not
exhibit long-range order down to millikelvin temperature range. Given the large
separation between cerium ions which significantly reduces the superexchange
interactions and vanishingly small RKKY interaction, here we show that nodal
superconductivity mediated by the valence fluctuations must be a ground state
in these materials. We propose that the critical temperature for the
superconducting transition can be significantly increased by applying
hydrostatic pressure. We employ an extended periodic Anderson lattice model
which includes the long-range Coulomb interactions between the itinerant
electrons as well as the local Coulomb interaction between the predominantly
localized and itinerant electrons to compute a critical temperature of the
superconducting transition. Using the slave-boson approach we show that
fluctuations mediated by the repulsive electron-electron interactions lead to
the emergence of d-wave superconductivity.

We present magneto-optical studies of a self-assembled semiconductor quantum
dot, concentrating specifically on the case in which the dot is doubly
positively charged, studying this way the confined hole - hole exchange
interaction. A simple harmonic potential model, which we extend to capture the
influence of an externally applied magnetic field in Faraday configuration
fully describe the observed polarization sensitive magneto-photoluminscence
spectra. We deduce the effective composition of the quantum dot from its
measured electronic g-factor. Using this value we determine the dot effective
permittivity and quantitatively describe various measured excitonic
transitions, their measured Zeeman splittings and their diamagnetic shifts. In
particular, the model quantitatively accounts for an observed pronounced
negative diamagnetic shift, which provides a direct measure for the hole-hole
exchange interaction and its dependence on the externally applied magnetic
field strength.

LuFe$_4$Ge$_2$ crystallizes in the ZrFe$_4$Si$_2$-type structure, hosting
chains of Fe-tetrahedra giving rise to geometric frustration and
low-dimensionality. The compound orders antiferromagnetically at around 36 K
accompanied by a simultaneous structural transition from a tetragonal to an
orthorhombic phase. The hydrostatic pressure dependence of the magnetic and
structural transitions is investigated using electrical-transport, ac
magnetic-susceptibility, ac calorimetry, M$\ddot{\rm o}$ssbauer, muon-spin
relaxation ($\mu$SR), and x-ray diffraction measurements. External pressure
suppresses the first-order transition to the antiferromagnetic phase (AFM1)
around 1.8 GPa. The structural transition is largely unaffected by pressure and
remains between 30 to 35 K for pressures up to 2 GPa. A second
antiferromagnetic phase (AFM2) is observed at higher pressures. The transition
from the paramagnetic to the AFM2 phase is of second-order nature and appears
to be connected to the structural transition. The magnetic volume fraction
obtained from $\mu$SR and M$\ddot{\rm o}$ssbauer measurements reveal that the
entire sample undergoes magnetic ordering in both magnetic phases. In addition,
similar low-temperature muon-precession frequencies in AFM1 and AFM2 phases
point at similar ordered moments and magnetic structures in both phases. Our
results further indicate enhanced magnetic fluctuations in the pressure induced
AFM2 phase. The experimental observations together with density functional
theory calculations suggest that the magnetic and structural order parameters
in LuFe$_4$Ge$_2$ are linked by magnetic frustration, causing the simultaneous
magneto-structural transition.

With the rise in in-memory computing architectures to reduce the
compute-memory bottleneck, a new bottleneck is present between analog and
digital conversion. Analog content-addressable memories (ACAM) are being
recently studied for in-memory computing to efficiently convert between analog
and digital signals. Magnetic memory elements such as magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs) could be useful for ACAM due to their low read/write energy and high
endurance, but MTJs are usually restricted to digital values. The spin orbit
torque-driven domain wall-magnetic tunnel junction (DW-MTJ) has been recently
shown to have multi-bit function. Here, an ACAM circuit is studied that uses
two domain wall-magnetic tunnel junctions (DW-MTJs) as the analog storage
elements. Prototype DW-MTJ data is input into the magnetic ACAM (MACAM) circuit
simulation, showing ternary CAM function. Device-circuit co-design is carried
out, showing that 8-10 weight bits are achievable, and that designing
asymmetrical spacing of the available DW positions in the device leads to
evenly spaced ACAM search bounds. Analyzing available spin orbit torque
materials shows platinum provides the largest MACAM search bound while still
allowing spin orbit torque domain wall motion, and that the circuit is
optimized with minimized MTJ resistance, minimized spin orbit torque material
resistance, and maximized tunnel magnetoresistance. These results show the
feasibility of using DW-MTJs for MACAM and provide design parameters.

Computation of entropy in liquids and liquid crystal phases is a big
challenge in statistical physics. In this work, we extend the two-phase
thermodynamic model (2PT) to shape anisotropic soft repulsive spherocylinders
(SRSs) and report the absolute values of entropy for different liquid crystal
(LC) phases for a range of aspect ratios L/D = 2-5. We calculate the density of
states (DoS) for different LC phases and decompose it into contributions
arising from translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The translational
and rotational modes are further partitioned into diffusive, gas-like, and
non-diffusive, solid-like components using a fluidicity factor. In the dilute
limit, the entropy values obtained from the 2PT method match exactly those of
an ideal rigid rotor. We find that, for a given packing fraction, the magnitude
of the total entropy is roughly equal regardless of the different LC phases
associated with different aspect ratios. We also compute the excess entropy
(for L/D = 5) and compare those with the values obtained using the standard
integration approach of molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) equation of
state (EOS) of SRS. The values obtained using both approaches match very well.
The rotational and translational fluidicity factors are further used to
determine the phase boundaries of different liquid crystal phases for the
respective aspect ratios.

Ion transport measurements are widely used as an indirect probe for various
properties of confined electrolytes. It is generally assumed that the ion
concentration in a nanoscale channel is equal to the ion concentration in the
macroscopic reservoirs it connects to, with deviations arising only in the
presence of surface charges on the channel walls. Here, we show that this
assumption may break down even in a neutral channel, due to electrostatic
correlations between the ions arising in the regime of interaction confinement,
where Coulomb interactions are reinforced due to the presence of the channel
walls. We focus on a one-dimensional channel geometry, where an exact
evaluation of the electrolyte's partition function is possible with a transfer
operator approach. Our exact solution reveals that in nanometre-scale channels,
the ion concentration is generally lower than in the reservoirs, and depends
continuously on the bulk salt concentration, in contrast to conventional
mean-field theory that predicts an abrupt filling transition. We develop a
modified mean-field theory taking into account the presence of ion pairs that
agrees quantitatively with the exact solution and provides predictions for
experimentally-relevant observables such as the ionic conductivity. Our results
will guide the interpretation of nanoscale ion transport measurements.
