<h3>Topological Superconductor from the Quantum Hall Phase: Effective Field Theory Description</h3>

We derive low-energy effective field theories for the quantum anomalous Hall
and topological superconducting phases. The quantum Hall phase is realized in
terms of free fermions with nonrelativistic dispersion relation, possessing a
global $U(1)$ symmetry. We couple this symmetry with a background gauge field
and compute the effective action by integrating out the gapped fermions. In
spite of the fact that the corresponding Dirac operator governing the dynamics
of the original fermions is nonrelativistic, the leading contribution in the
effective action is a usual Abelian $U(1)$ Chern-Simons term. The proximity to
a conventional superconductor induces a pairing potential in the quantum Hall
state, favoring the formation of Cooper pairs. When the pairing is strong
enough, it drives the system to a topological superconducting phase, hosting
Majorana fermions. Even though the continuum $U(1)$ symmetry is broken down to
a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ one, we can forge fictitious $U(1)$ symmetries that enable us
to derive the effective action for the topological superconducting phase, also
given by a Chern-Simons theory. To eliminate spurious states coming from the
artificial symmetry enlargement, we demand that the fields in the effective
action are $O(2)$ instead of $U(1)$ gauge fields. In the $O(2)$ case we have to
sum over the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bundles in the partition function, which projects
out the states that are not $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants. The corresponding edge
theory is the $U(1)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold, which contains Majorana fermions in
its operator content.

We investigate the effects of wedge disclination on charge carriers in
circular graphene quantum dots subjected to a magnetic flux. Using the
asymptotic solutions of the energy spectrum for large arguments, we approximate
the scattering matrix elements, and then study the density of states. It is
found that the density of states shows several resonance peaks under various
conditions. In particular, it is shown that the wedge disclination is able to
change the amplitude, width, and positions of resonance peaks.

<a href = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D2TC01510B">http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/D2TC01510B</a>

<br>
<br>
We report on the discovery, structural analysis, and the physical properties
of Nb$_4$SiSb$_2$ -- a hitherto unknown compound crystallizing in the
V$_4$SiSb$_2$-type structure with the tetragonal space group $I4/mcm$ and unit
cell parameters $a$ = 10.3638(2) $\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$ and $c$ = 4.9151(2)
$\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$. We find Nb$_4$SiSb$_2$ to be a metal undergoing a
transition to a superconducting state at a critical temperature of $T_{\rm c}
\approx$ 1.6 K. The bulk nature of the superconductivity in this material is
confirmed by the observation of a well defined discontinuity in specific heat
with a normalized specific heat jump of $\Delta C(T_{\rm c})/\gamma T_{\rm c} =
1.33\, {\rm mJ}\, {\rm mol}^{-1}\, {\rm K}^{-2}$. We find that for
Nb$_4$SiSb$_2$, the unoccupied sites on the $4b$ Wyckoff position can be
partially occupied with Cu, Pd, or Pt. Low-temperature resistivity measurements
show transitions to superconductivity for all three compounds at $T_{\rm c}
\approx\, 1.2\, {\rm K}$ for Nb$_4$Cu$_{0.2}$SiSb$_2$, and $T_{\rm c} \approx\,
0.8\, {\rm K}$ for Nb$_4$Pd$_{0.2}$SiSb$_2$ as well as for
Nb$_4$Pt$_{0.14}$SiSb$_2$. The addition of electron-donor atoms into these void
positions, henceforth, lowers the superconducting transition temperature in
comparison to the parent compound.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04805v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04805v1</a>
<br>

We theoretically investigate the real-time transient responses of a
two-dimensional (2D) electron gas with anisotropic Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) to laser pulses. Through explicitly monitoring the time-dependent
photocurrents and spin polarization under different linear polarizations of the
laser pulse, we find that the transient breaking of the mirror symmetry in
combination with the anisotropy of the Rashba SOC results in significant
distinction between the charge-mediated and the spin-mediated contributions to
the photocurrents. Such distinction is obtained by analyzing the dependence of
the symmetry-breaking induced (transverse) components of the photocurrents on
the linear polarization angle of the laser pulse. This suggests a possibility
of inferring spin-mediated processes in photocurrents without the use of
circularly polarized lights. Moreover, the interplay between transient symmetry
breaking and the anisotropy of the Rashba SOC also leads to transiently nonzero
spin polarization components that are otherwise zero in the steady-state limit
and the linear response regime. Especially, the out-of-plane spin polarization
component can be induced or turned off by controlling the relative orientation
of the linear polarization with respect to the symmetry axis of the 2D
electronic system, without involving material-intrinsic magnetization effects.
Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of a particular coordination between the
polarization of the ultrafast laser pulses and the spatial symmetry of the
electronic materials in directing the real-time charge and the spin responses
that are fundamental to the development of ultrafast spintronics in solid
states.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04795v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04795v1</a>

Hole-based spin qubits in strained planar germanium quantum wells have
received considerable attention due to their favourable properties and
remarkable experimental progress. The sizeable spin-orbit interaction in this
structure allows for efficient electric qubit operations. However, it also
couples the qubit to electrical noise. In this work we perform simulations of a
heterostructure hosting these hole spin qubits. We solve the effective mass
equations for a realistic heterostructure, provide a set of analytical basis
wave functions, and compute the effective g-factor of the heavy-hole
ground-state. Our investigations reveal a strong impact of highly excited light
hole states located outside the quantum well on the g-factor. Consequently,
contrary to recent predictions, we find that sweet spots in out-of-plane
magnetic fields are shifted to impractically large electric fields. However,
for magnetic fields close to in-plane alignment, sweet spots at low electric
fields are recovered. This work will be helpful in understanding and improving
coherence of germanium hole spin qubits.

In this paper, we address the modeling issues of cell movement and division
with a special focus on the phenomenon of volume exclusion in a lattice-based,
exact stochastic simulation framework. We propose a new exact method, called
Reduced Rate Method -- RRM, that is substantially quicker than the previously
used exclusion method, for large number of cells. In addition, we introduce
three novel reaction types: the contact-inhibited, the contact-promoted, and
the spontaneous reactions. To the best of our knowledge, these reaction types
have not been taken into account in lattice-based stochastic simulations of
cell cultures. These new types of events may be easily applied to complicated
systems, enabling the generation of biologically feasible stochastic cell
culture simulations. Furthermore, we show that the exclusion algorithm and our
RRM algorithm are mathematically equivalent in the sense that the next reaction
to be realized and the corresponding sojourn time both belong to the same
reaction and time distributions in the two approaches -- even with the newly
introduced reaction types.
  Exact, agent-based, stochastic methods of cell culture simulations seem to be
undervalued and are mostly used as benchmarking tools to validate deterministic
approximations of the corresponding stochastic models. Our proposed methods are
exact, they are easy to implement, have a high predictive value, and can be
conveniently extended with new features. Therefore, these approaches promise a
great potential.

We discuss several algorithms for sampling from unnormalized probability
distributions in statistical physics, but using the language of statistics and
machine learning. We provide a self-contained introduction to some key ideas
and concepts of the field, before discussing three well-known problems: phase
transitions in the Ising model, the melting transition on a two-dimensional
plane and simulation of an all-atom model for liquid water. We review the
classical Metropolis, Glauber and molecular dynamics sampling algorithms before
discussing several more recent approaches, including cluster algorithms, novel
variations of hybrid Monte Carlo and Langevin dynamics and piece-wise
deterministic processes such as event chain Monte Carlo. We highlight
cross-over with statistics and machine learning throughout and present some
results on event chain Monte Carlo and sampling from the Ising model using
tools from the statistics literature. We provide a simulation study on the
Ising and XY models, with reproducible code freely available online, and
following this we discuss several open areas for interaction between the
disciplines that have not yet been explored and suggest avenues for doing so.

<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04677v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04677v1</a>
<br>

We investigate emergent odd-frequency pairs and proximity effect in nematic
and chiral states of superconducting topological insulators (STIs), such as
$M_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ ($M=$ Cu, Sr, Nb). The interplay of superconducting gap
symmetry, the orbital degrees of freedom, and strong spin-orbit interaction
generates a variety of odd-frequency pairs in the bulk and surface of STIs. The
nematic and chiral states are the prototypes of time-reversal-invariant
topological superconductors and Weyl superconductors, respectively, which are
accompanied by topologically protected gapless surface Andreev bound states
(SABSs). We find that the Fermi surface evolution from a closed spheroidal to
an open cylindrical shape gives rise to the evolution of the emergent
odd-frequency pairs and SABSs in the nematic and chiral states. In addition,
spin polarization of odd-frequency pairs and SABSs stems from the non-unitary
pairing in the chiral state. We propose that these evolution and spin
polarization of odd-frequency pairs and SABSs can be captured by tunneling
conductance measurements. Furthermore, we study the anomalous proximity effect
in various irreducible representations of STIs. The anomalous proximity effect
is originally predicted in spin-triplet superconductor junctions without
spin-orbit interaction; Odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave pairs penetrate
into diffusive normal metals (DN) and induce a pronounced zero-energy peak of
the local density of states in the DN region. Here we demonstrate that the
anomalous proximity effect in STIs is not immune to nonmagnetic impurities. The
fragility is attributed to the fact that the proximitized odd-frequency
even-parity pairs are admixtures of $s$-wave and non-$s$-wave pairs due to
strong spin-orbit interaction inherent to the parent materials.

<br>
Embodying bosonic and electrically interactive characteristics in
two-dimensional space, excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
have garnered considerable attention. The realisation and application of
strong-correlation effects, long-range transport, and valley-dependent
optoelectronic properties require customising exciton decay dynamics. Strains,
defects, and electrostatic doping effectively control the decay dynamics but
significantly disturb the intrinsic properties of TMDCs, such as electron band
structure and exciton binding energy. Meanwhile, vacuum-field manipulation
provides an optical alternative for engineering radiative decay dynamics.
Planar mirrors and cavities have been employed to manage the light-matter
interactions of two-dimensional excitons. However, the conventional flat
platforms cannot customise the radiative decay landscape in the horizontal TMDC
plane or independently control vacuum field interference at different pumping
and emission frequencies. Here, we present a meta-mirror resolving the issues
with more optical freedom. For neutral excitons of the monolayer MoSe2, the
meta-mirror manipulated the radiative decay rate by two orders of magnitude,
depending on its geometry. Moreover, we experimentally identified the
correlation between emission intensity and spectral linewidth. The anisotropic
meta-mirror demonstrated polarisation-dependent radiative decay control. We
expect that the meta-mirror platform will be promising to tailor the
two-dimensional distributions of lifetime, density, and diffusion of TMDC
excitons in advanced opto-excitonic applications.

</body><h3>A local pre-decoder to reduce the bandwidth and latency of quantum error correction</h3>
<a href = "http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04660v1">http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04660v1</a>
<br>
<i>Samuel C. Smith, Benjamin J. Brown, Stephen D. Bartlett</i>
<br>
<br>
A fault-tolerant quantum computer will be supported by a classical decoding
system interfacing with quantum hardware to perform quantum error correction.
It is important that the decoder can keep pace with the quantum clock speed,
within the limitations on communication that are imposed by the physical
architecture. To this end we propose a local `pre-decoder', which makes greedy
corrections to reduce the amount of syndrome data sent to a standard matching
decoder. We study these classical overheads for the surface code under a
phenomenological phase-flip noise model with imperfect measurements. We find
substantial improvements in the runtime of the global decoder and the
communication bandwidth by using the pre-decoder. For instance, to achieve a
logical failure probability of $f = 10^{-15}$ using qubits with physical error
rate $p = 10^{-3}$ and a distance $d=22$ code, we find that the bandwidth cost
is reduced by a factor of $1000$, and the time taken by a matching decoder is
sped up by a factor of $200$. To achieve this target failure probability, the
pre-decoding approach requires a $50\%$ increase in the qubit count compared
with the optimal decoder.

<br>

The dynamics of charge carriers in lattices of quantum spins is a long
standing and fundamental problem. Recently, a new generation of quantum
simulation experiments based on atoms in optical lattices has emerged that
gives unprecedented insights into the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of
this problem, which compliments earlier results from condensed matter
experiments. Focusing on observables accessible in these new experiments, we
explore here the equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium dynamics of a mobile
hole in two coupled antiferromagnetic spin lattices. Using a self-consistent
Born approximation, we calculate the spectral properties of the hole in the
bilayer and extract the energy bands of the quasiparticles, corresponding to
magnetic polarons that are either symmetric or anti-symmetric under layer
exchange. These two kinds of polarons are degenerate at certain momenta due to
the antiferromagnetic symmetry, and we, furthermore, examine how the momentum
of the ground state polaron depends on the interlayer coupling strength. The
long time dynamics of a hole initially created in one layer is shown to be
characterised by oscillations between the two layers with a frequency given by
the energy difference between the symmetric and the anti-symmetric polaron. We
finally demonstrate that the expansion velocity of a hole initially created at
a given lattice site is governed by the ballistic motion of polarons. It
moreover depends non-monotonically on the interlayer coupling, eventually
increasing as a quantum phase transition to a disordered state is approached.
