<h3>Strong electronic winds blowing under liquid flows on carbon surfaces</h3>

The interface between a liquid and a solid is the location of plethora of
intrincate mechanisms at the nanoscale, at the root of their specific emerging
properties in natural processes or technological applications. However, while
the structural properties and chemistry of interfaces have been intensively
explored, the effect of the solid-state electronic transport at the fluid
interface has been broadly overlooked up to now. It has been reported that
water flowing against carbon-based nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes or
graphene sheets, does induce electronic currents, but the mechanism at stake
remains controversial. Here, we unveil the molecular mechanisms underlying the
hydro-electronic couplings by investigating the electronic conversion under
flow at the nanoscale. We use a tuning fork-Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to
deposit and displace a micrometric droplet of both ionic and non-ionic liquids
on a multilayer graphene sample, while recording the electrical current across
the carbon flake. We report measurements of an oscillation-induced current
which is several orders of magnitude larger than previously reported for water
on carbon , and further boosted by the presence of surface wrinkles on the
carbon layer. Our results point to a peculiar momentum transfer mechanism
between fluid molecules and charge carriers in the carbon walls mediated by
phonon excitations in the solid. Our findings pave the way for active control
of fluid transfer at the nanoscale by harnessing the complex interplay between
collective excitations in the solid and the molecules in the fluid.

<h3>Disorder-enhanced effective masses and deviations from Matthiessen's rule in PdCoO$_2$ thin films</h3>

The observation of hydrodynamic transport in the metallic delafossite
PdCoO$_2$ has increased interest in this family of highly conductive oxides,
but experimental studies so far have mostly been confined to bulk crystals. In
this work, the development of high-quality thin films of PdCoO$_2$ has enabled
a thorough study of the conductivity as a function of film thickness using both
dc transport and time-domain THz spectroscopy. With increasing film thickness
from 12 nm to 102 nm, the residual resistivity decreases and we observe a large
deviation from Matthiessen's rule (DMR) in the temperature dependence of the
resistivity. We find that the complex THz conductivity is well fit by a single
Drude term. We fit the data to extract the spectral weight and scattering rate
simultaneously. The temperature dependence of the Drude scattering rate is
found to be nearly independent of the residual resistivity and cannot be the
primary mechanism for the observed DMR. Rather, we observe large changes in the
spectral weight as a function of disorder, changing by a factor of 1.5 from the
most disordered to least disordered films. We believe this corresponds to a
mass enhancement of $\geq 2$ times the value of the bulk effective mass which
increases with residual disorder. This suggests that the mechanism behind the
DMR observed in dc resistivity is primarily driven by changes in the electron
mass. We discuss the possible origins of this behavior including the
possibility of disorder-enhanced electron-phonon scattering, which can be
systematically tuned by film thickness.
